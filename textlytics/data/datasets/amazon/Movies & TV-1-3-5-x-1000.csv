" Disc One (73",5.0
" Yes indeed the game was beautiful. Too bad no one really knows about it. When i played the game I absolutely loved it. A true masterpiece one of squaresofts best by far. But when I got the Soundtrack it was mind blowing. Every Song was on it. Plus the caftsmanship from the director was just overwhelming. The game and soundtrack by far are the best in squaresofts history. Never has there been a great combination. From Listening threw out Disc one which features some really cool Resident Evil only in symphony mode. Yes this Soundtrack is by far the best Video Game soundtrack that I have ever gotten. All I have to say is get the game first once you beat it. Get the soundtrack next. You'll know what I mean by what a true RPG game and music is all about. ",5.0
" With Vagrant Story Sakimoto expertly combines dissonance ambience and melody to create a simply gorgeous videogame score. In fact I'm going to call it one of Squaresoft's best. There is not one dud in the soundtrack. It's even better in-game but buy the soundtrack! ",5.0
" The only critiscm I have about this sound track are the two bonus tracks (which don't appear in the game and add nothing to the preceding tracks on the cds) and the strange morph that one of the tracks (I believe that it is Escape) takes turning from a good piece of music into something that seems to have escaped from the eighties.Apart from that I can't recommend this OST highly enough especially Disc 2 - Track 29 -Staff Roll which unlike the other tracks on the disc is an acoustic Strings Piece that really shows off Hitoshi Sakimoto's talents as a composer. ",5.0
" When I heard the first few tracks of this OST in an ill-fated battle track contest I can't say I was too impressed. They seemed to be rather bland and even downright boring. However I used to also think the same thing about the Final Fantasy Tactics soundtrack which I now adore. That and I'm not the type to give up on an entire soundtrack after listening to just a few songs once or twice.That said I took it upon myself to find the Vagrant Story soundtrack and I forced myself to listen to it. Several times. Dozens of times even. I played it on the PC. In the car and my portable players. Eventually it began to grow on me. I began to appericiate its incredibly dark ambience its undeniable intelligence the wonderful quality of the synth and the sheer complexity of the compositions a delight for people like me who like to analyze things.I think I first realized 'I love this soundtrack' when I felt shivers running down my spine while listening to the end of 'Climax of the Grayland Case.' How beautiful! Or maybe it was when it thought to myself 'That heavy piano playing really does remind me of iron!' while listening to 'Iron Crab'. Or perhaps it was when I was listening to 'Staff Roll' and it made my day a little happier when the main melody kicked in at around 4",5.0
" Excellent stockings for long shifts on your feet - not too tight not too loose...garment integrity is longer than package states (with proper care). ",5.0
" After I had a DVT my doctor required me to wear compression stockings. I wore ugly white TED hose and yucky thick brown stockings. Then I found Jobst UltraSheer. They gave me the compression I needed (15-20) but looked like regular pantyhose. Even though my blood clot has been gone for 4 years I still buy these to wear as support stockings because they make my legs feel so nice.**Note I have problems with the rubberized tops rolling down my thigh. I tried the Jobst adhesive but I hated having my skin pulled all day. I bought an inexpensive garter belt and it works fine and helps keep the stockings from rolling. ",5.0
" My doctor recommended the thigh high version of this product but I became very aggravated with them constantly rolling down through the course of the day. They were never comfortable. With my doctor's permission I switched over to the knee highs and they are WONDERFUL!!! I don't even know I'm wearing them! They totally control my calf aching and swelling. Would highly recommend them!!! ",5.0
" Stockings fit well and are comfortable. Haven't had the opportunity to see how effective they are in preventing edema from air travel. ",5.0
" Excellent product. However they are very difficult to get on for older people. I feel like I've had a full day workout after getting them on. Also as the day wears on they begin to roll down from the top and create a very deep ridge in the skin. I have to wear them so if those two difficulties could be addressed it would be such a help. ",5.0
" Does a very good job of relieving fatigue. This is a well known brand and is certainly comfortable enough to wear all day. Even if your doctor didn't prescribe these but you are on your feet alot take care of yourself and buy these. ",5.0
" It is wonderful to find exactly what you are looking for. I didn't after three years using them I found they have them with a closed toes. I love them ",5.0
" I've always had pain in my legs during long travels either by car or plane when you can't move very much. I used them for a recent trip consisting on 6 flights total and I could feel the difference. I wasn't totally stiff when I got off the planes. They do stay in place with the band at the top. Just be careful they tear as easily as stockings. If you'll use them much you better get a couple of extra pairs. ",5.0

" I thoroughly enjoyed Rising Sons and Daughters. I don't know of any other book that looks at Japanese society from the point of view of its young people poised as they are between their parents' age-old Japanese culture of restraint and obedience to the will of the community and their peers' adulation of Western culture. True to form the 'New Young' of Japan seem to be creating an 'international' blend as the Ando family demonstrates in this beautifully written book of vignettes of the private lives of members of this family. Steven Wardell is clearly a talented young author adopted for some of his schooling into this family of four teens and thus able to view family life in Japan from the inside out. A great read! ",5.0
" Wondering what the hell has happened to the moral aspect of modern American culture ? This book is a lucid well argued explanation of the simple fact that we have become so totally focused on our individual RIGHTS that we have completely ignored and even mocked our personal and public responsibilities. The final response and indictment of Robert Ringer's best seller LOOKING OUT FOR #1. This is a great time for anyone who is disgusted with the boorish state of American media politics and discourse in general to clear their heads for the substantial challenges that lie before us not only as Americans but as human beings. A great book ",5.0
" Joy in God--necessary? Or simply optional??? John Piper explains why that if Christ is to be the sun at the center of the solar system of our lives then He must also be our supreme joy over all other 'lesser treasures.' Glorifying God can only be done from a heart that is glad in God. Deep joy in God is the true foundation for all obedience; treasuring Him over all things is the only Christ-exalting motivation to endure suffering...especially to willfuly choose suffering.Show it to your Youth Group Men's/Women's Group or Home Bible Study. Set your church ablaze with a passion for the glory of God in the supremacy of Christ over all things in this world. Everything being fueled by a Spirit produced joy and satisfaction in the Lord Himself--to His praise and renoun!Only because of grace--Jeffrey ",5.0
" Piper has a passion for the glory of Christ that is contagious. I've watched these videos multiple times and glean something from it every time. Amazing that he presents this MEATY material to a youth group and they are transfixed the entire time.I don't really care for the youth interviews but I understand given the format of the original presentation. I've used this in a men's group and all enjoyed the material and we had some great discussions.I'd recommend to anybody. The humility and genuine concern of Piper toward his audience is refreshing against some of the other more famous 'christian leaders' today. ",5.0
" I am so grateful for the Blazing Center DVD and the exceptional price. I enjoyed immensely seeing the dynamic presentation by an author I have read for all these years. I would love to see this DVD given to many of our grandchildren. ",5.0

" Though it would be nice to have a solid polished brass fireplace screen this product certainly fits our needs. For the price it looks quite attractive and provides what we wanted in safety. It sets off our polished brass in our living room and serves the purpose to protect against accidents for our granddaughters. Quick service on delivery as well. ",5.0
" We were surprised. Pleasantly.A weighty perfect model of this classic screen would certainly not be available for anything close to the price of the Uniflame model but the Uniflame looks amazingly good anyway. This thing does the trick!We bought it to replace an 'original' solid brass model costing nearly $500 (and it's cheap construction design eventually giving way to its heaviness when moved). As long as someone doesn't examine the new screen from close-up it actually looks better (not really terrible at all close-up) and it's lighter weight makes it easy to handle.JRT ",5.0
" This is an excellent fireplace screen for the price. I was somewhat surprised at how light the screen is as compared to other fireplace screens I have in the house. You certainly won't have a hard time moving it away from the fireplace. I actually purchased it to put in front of a gas fireplace in order to make the fire look more authentic and it does the job ! ",5.0
" Product arrived on the third day after I ordered despite a delivery estimate of 7-10 days. I'm impressed with both the product and the marketplace seller (PrimeNetShops). The screen came well packaged and in good shape. One of the decorative knobs on top had come unscrewed and was in the bottom of the box but it re-attached with ease. It's light enough that it can be moved with ease but still feels sturdy enough that it should last for years to come. Great product great experience. Everything that is right about Amazon all in one order! ",5.0
" Man some more jammin tracks from the SUC. This is Pokey's first official record....and sh** is sooo real. Love the production everything is real nice & screwed out. This is among the last of the great SUC records. Not to say they've fallen off....just they've downsized so much with the deaths of the screw pioneers. Sad but true. If ya love Tx rap you've gotta get this 1. Somethin to kickback & blow big too somethin to jam in the ride. So underrated right here. I wish people would forget all the bullsh** on BET/MTV and check what's happening in Houston. But i guess...it's sadly almost too late. Pat's gone hawk's gone...screw Moe Pimp C Big Steve. Makes me sad. Regardless Pokey is still alive and making new music keeping the legacy alive. And this is a great place to start with him. Classic record. Love it man ",5.0

Thank you Bear Family! ",5.0
" This book contains a great amount of vocabulary. It teaches you the Anglicized versions of certain words such as 'teacher' but it also gives you the Yoruba word. Although I didn't appreciate the Anglicized words at first they are good to know because a lot of people use them. The CD is an excellent and necessary addition to the book. There are lots of dialogues and lists of vocabulary on them (there are 2 CDs). The CD does skip over some of the exercises in the book which I guess you're supposed to go over by yourself or with a teacher though. All in all it's a great set and if mastered can bring the user to a high level of fluency. I also like that the narrator who speaks English to announce the lessons is a native speaker and doesn't butcher the names of the characters in the dialogues. There is a Yoruba book/CD set created by another publisher who uses a British narrator. It really throws you off course throughout the CD. Watch out for that one and buy this one instead! ",5.0

" My 4 year old daughter LOVES this game. She sings the 'Strike Up The Band and Clap Your Hands for Kelly's Pet Parade!' song around the house. She can dress the Kelly kids 'train' each pet (teach the pony to jump etc.) clean and get the animals ready for the parade (paint the elephant's toe nails etc.) and decorate the floats...all by herself. She'll get everything ready (showing me everything she has accomplished along the way) and then we'll watch her special parade. A wonderfully cute game that I highly recommend.She can mostly do the entire game on her own. I have it installed on a laptop so she is actually using the inset mouse and can still do the game. The only one she has a tough time with is the Polar Bear catching fish game. It's tricky to move your finger on the mouse pad and click at the same time to catch the fish. It would be much easier using a regular mouse. ",5.0

" My 6-year old and 5-year old both really enjoy this game. Has lots to do with several different animals to prepare for the parade. You get to design a float and it just endless fun! Graphics and animation are very colorful and cute. It's a winner! ",5.0
" Apparently this is about the best $... I have spent lately (aside from the Gameboy game I sent my nephew). My niece is mesmorized by this game and it is keeping my sister busy building parades. My niece is a little too young to run this program by herself but she has definitely figured out what button needs to be pushed to make the parade start! My sister also told me that she likes the fact that you can save multiple parades for those days when she just doesn't have time to help create a new one. This seems to be a winner! ",5.0
" I got this for my 3 1/2 yr old for Christmas and both her and her 7 yr old sister LOVE it! They have played it for hours. The graphics are very good and it has lots of cute and entertaining games! I highly recommend this one! It's worth the money! ",5.0

" If you've played this game in the arcade and liked it then you'll definitely like this version to play at home whenever you like. You don't need a supercomputer to run it and the graphics and controls are amazing and faithful to the incredibly fun and fast arcade experience. This version also has plenty of unlockables which you get by playing and earning miles as well as mini-games that are a fun diversion from the classic arcade game. It has the European-themed levels of Outrun2 and the America-themed levels of Outrun2 SP for a total of 30 stages to race through in the classic Outrun-branching style or sequentially or with challenges such as beating rival racers. This game is affordable fun and has plenty of replay value. You may not want to play it for hours and hours but you'll keep coming back to it if you like to get a speedy arcade fix every now and then. ",5.0
" I remember playing Outrun in the arcades when it came out in the I think it was eighties. It had flashy graphics flashy steering wheel pedals and corny but catchy music. It was the kind of game I'd play on the way out of the arcade when all but the last dribbles of coinage had been spent on the more 'serious' (read challenging) games. Actually when I think about it Outrun was always placed by the entrance perhaps for this reason. Main meal of games inside followed by quick dessert on the way out. And Outrun is quick. And fun. And flashy. Colourful pretty and simple. Not much depth here but some very cool twists on your standard arcade racer. Lots of different Ferraris lots of different scenery and wow does it look good! Pure unadulterated eye candy. Two problems however. It wont run on full accelerated sound on my sound card (budget Creative) so I have to switch the acceleration back to minimum through my control panel or the game will just keep crashing when it comes time to race. Secondly the configuration for gamepad bites. It won't allow me to allocate the buttons I want for acceleration and braking so I end up using the right analogue joystick for both (left to accelerate right to brake). Sounds dicky and I suppose it is but it's actually pretty easy to get used to. As far as I'm aware there are no patches for said problems. Despite these issues Outrun 2006 C2C is a blast fun from go to wo. It's sugary sweet and just the thing for a low gaming BSL. ",5.0

" Thanks to my grandparents who came to America in the first decade of the 20th century I grew up and have had a good life. Thanks to my grandparents I didn't become a piece of ash or a few tossed out bones in an Eastern European field at the age of 2. Wars are wars; they've occured throughout human history but in most of them whole civilizations didn't disappear. But the Eastern European Jewish world is gone forever. I might belong to the same gene pool but compared to the characters in Isaac Bashevis Singer's stories I'm as American as apple pie. Irish-Americans can discover their roots in Ireland Chinese-Americans in China and so on but not me. My cultural roots are gone forever. The only way I can learn them is through reading literature written by Singer Shalom Aleichem Isaac Babel and others who describe that vanished world. So obviously my interest and pleasure in reading such wonderful tales as appear in THE SEANCE and OTHER STORIES is all the more. Never mind my personal reasons. These amazing stories by a Nobel Prize winner will stay with you for a long time. The strange sad characters afflicted by poverty and by life bring us face to face with common human personalities of all times and places while also depicting the conditions and peculiar relationships of Jews in Poland too. Magic religion animals thieves rabbis prostitutes mystics Holocaust survivors Talmudic scholars prisoners books butchers and shopkeepers crowd the pages. In each story you find pathos and tragedy happiness and satisfaction tensions and transformations. Two of the stories 'The Seance' and 'The Letter Writer' must rank with the best stories I have ever read; none of the others are bad. If you have never read Singer this is an excellent book to start with. If you have you know what I am talking about. This is the great writer at the top of his form. ",5.0
" Isaac Bashevis Singer was no doubt one of the greatest short story writers - ever! The various collections in the end also earned him a very well deserved Nobel Prize for literature in 1978. Several of his stories were first published in magazines like The New Yorker Encounter and Playboy. The first collection I read was Passions and Other Stories which immediately made me realise what a master Isaac Bashevis Singer was. Later I have read several of his novels and short stories where especially the collections Gimpel the Fool Short Friday and The Seance are at least as good as Passions. All a magnificent world of Isaac Bashevis Singer's saints and sinners. Sad funny ironic poignant and seeming to come from Singer's pen without any efforts. This is what good short stories is all about! ",5.0

" Of many CDs I've purchased in the last couple of years this easily ranks as one of the best. Kudos to Muse for finally recording Spaulding as a leader in 1988 and now to Joel Dorn for reissuing the disk.As the title indicates 'Brilliant Corners' is filled with music by Monk. But what stands out is the freshness of the interpretations of the master's pieces. Rather than simply trying to sound like Monk Spaulding and his cohorts try -- very successfully -- to make music that builds on Monk's ideas.Spaulding tears through every solo he has on alto and offers beautiful contrast with his flute playing as on 'Let's Cool One.' He's aided by trumpeter Wallace Roney who abandons his occasional propensity for imitating Miles Davis and instead lets his own sound shine through. Pianist Mulgrew Miller has never sounded better. In fact the whole group (Ron Carter on bass and Kenny Washington on drums) strongly delivers the message that they are playing music that they love. There is no better way to express that love than by offering the robust voicings that you hear on this disk.If there is a regret when you listen to this music it is that Spaulding who contributed so much to Blue Note dates in the '60s has had so few opportunities to further explore his own muse. Better late than never. ",5.0
" Story goes that after a number of excellent second horn sessions on mid 60's Blue Note where flute.altoand soprano were wielded masterfully by James Spaulding he was given a shot as a leader.He was the non star(leader) that was called in manymany times.But at the point he got his offer Direction/Production had switched from Alfred Lion to Francis Wolff and A&R; fro Ike Quebec to Duke Pearson.Bottom line was they offered Spaulding a shot if he would fit into the new funky blues idiom of the Liberty era and he refused not being true to the hard bop form.Well even though he recorded few albums as a leader latter on labels like Muse('Smile Of The Snake' and 'Blues Nexus are also fine 4 star or better efforts).He he has and excellent session with Wallace Ronney on trumpetMulgrew Miller and Ron Carter on bass and Kenny Washington on drums.Fine line up.And though there are so many Monk tribute Lp's it is the musicianship wielded with passion that makes this a cut of above.As mentioned his flute playing is fine.I find jazz flute hit or miss and here it just works fine.Not a direct copy of the Monk style it shows th timeless of the compositions (not that a total analogue LP with some personal character is bad-see Walter Davis Jr. piano solo 'In Walked Thelonius').I'd call this no an essential Lp but for Monk fans it may be.CheersChazz ",5.0
" Few pieces of music in the history of the gramophone can have suffered such indignities at the hands of insensitive record producers as Saint-Sans's Third Symphony. A glance through the catalogues might suggest one is spoiled for choice but to date I have only found two recordings which do full justice to the work. Now here's a third although altogether different. . . this is a recording which not only deserves repeated listening but positively demands it. Yu reveals just what a magnificent piece of music this is; shorn of its customary sonic spectacle the brilliant craftsmanship of Saint-Sans's writing is displayed in unimpeded glory. . .In The Carnival of the animals . . . Yu opts for the version for large orchestra complete with glass harmonica (adeptly played by Alasdair Malloy) and while it is again characterized by meticulous attention to detail it is also a performance full of buoyant wit. . .

Five years later she still takes many supplementary courses each year to continue her education. Most of her free time is spend with distance learning courses or reaching herbs. Chinese Medicine is vast and deep. A 5 year basic study is not nearly enough time to understand this medicine. In Chinese Medicine they say even a lifetime is not long enough to understand this medicine. Thankfully for the lay person we have this book!I personally own 2 copies of this book. One I have at home the other is in our Chinese Medicine office.

" The Gathering to me has always been an escape from the everyday music you hear. So when I heard they were releasing a B-sides and rarities collection I was more than happy. Every expectation I had they met. I'm dumbfounded as to how The Gathering can create such innovative and beautiful music yet they're still somehow overlooked. From the epic orchestrations to Anneke's jawdropping voice there's no reason that everyone shouldn't love this music. Needless to say if you liked The Gathering before you got this CD if anything you'll like them more coming out of listening to it.Disc one acts as the B-sides. A lot of B-sides have horrible sound quality but the ones on this compilation sound as if they were on a CD but were taken off at the extreme last minute. There's a polished feel but not so polished that the music feels fabricated. The live versions featured on here are astounding. If you didn't look at the back cover to know they were live you'd never guess it. Anneke's voice is gorgeous and the band is just simply amazing. How they don't miss a single beat I'll never know. The covers Dead Can Dance's In Power We Entrust The Love Advocated Slowdive's When The Sun Hits and Talk Talk's Life's What You Make It are about the best covers I've ever heard. Quite often you hear a band just desecrate the original but with The Gathering it feels like they took they're time while doing the originals justice.Disc two serves as the rarities section. From the opening track New Moon Different Day you know that The Gathering is eons better than almost any band playing music today. Anneke's vocals simply soar and will give you goosebumps that I will guarantee. It doesn't end there though each song is equally as good as the last. Even the demos have a sound quality that could rival a studio CD. The two previously unreleased instrumentals Diamond Box and Hjelmar's stand true to the ones that are released. The beauty is palpable and shows tremendous skill skill that no radio band will ever come close to. Travel from the CD How To Measure A Planet? has always been my favorite song by The Gathering. To hear the demo is really something though it sounds completely different while still sounding exactly the same. My second favorite track of their's Nighttime Birds is the same case as Travel. I do think Anneke's vocals are stronger on Nighttime Birds though.Overall my favorite songs are In Power We Entrust The Love Advocated Frail Life's What You Make It New Moon Different Day Nighttime Birds and Travel. The Gathering is a band I've always found to be one that you have to experience rather than listen to. Yes you can pick favorite songs but overall each CD they released and even this collection seem to be made to go together. Each song seems to flow into the next seamlessly. In my opinion no band does this genre more justice than The Gathering does. ",5.0
" All fans of The Gathering need to check this out especially those in the States where the majority of these songs are nearly impossible to find anywhere else. This compilation is worth buying for 'In Power We Entrust the Love Advocated' (Dead Can Dance cover) and 'When the Sun Hits' (Slowdive cover) alone; both are heartbreakingly beautiful and feature some of Anneke's finest vocals.Fans of The Gathering's albums Mandylion and Nighttime Birds will be delighted with 'Adrenaline' a very catchy song that was written because the band needed another fast simple rocking song to play at concerts.I think The Gathering's greatest album is How to Measure a Planet and it is awesome to finally hear the demos for songs like 'Travel' 'My Electricity' and 'Red is a Slow Colour.' 'Travel' especially went through a lot of transformations before its final version.This double-CD has so much to offer. There are also detailed song descriptions written by the band and several photos on the inside booklet. ",5.0
" If I could only have one selection by The Gathering this would be it. Some of the alternate versions are better than what was originally released (e.g. instrumental version of Kevin's Telescope).

" Four DVDs in the 'Thomas & Friends' series are sure to delight young viewers ages 2 and up with the exciting adventures of Thomas the Tank Engine and his transportational friends. Each affordably priced DVD features narration by celebrity George Carlin roughly 40 minutes of short stories plus another 60 minutes of bonus features such as sing-along songs DVD games and character galleries. 'A Big Day for Thomas' covers Thomas' adventure when he gets to pull his very own train for the first time; 'Trust Thomas & Other Stories' follows Thomas' discovery of a new way to cross a river; 'Percy's Ghostly Trick & Other Thomas Stories' is a spooky adventure in which Percy's mischievous trick to make Thomas believe in ghosts backfires when Percy puffs into a big pile of hay. 'Thomas & The Special Letter' sets up a conflict with George a bad-tempered steamroller convinced that roads are more important than rails. Since the many stories on each DVD are so short they can be shown to young people who have only a few spare minutes such as right before bedtime or all at once.

" First of all let me say that I love Thomas the Tank Engine. My 6-year-old son has loved Thomas for 3+ years running and I am very grateful for all the good times the three of us have had. That having been said this is a compilation VHS. You will not find any new stories on this one. However it is worth viewing (and getting if you don't have a big collection) if you have children. We got this as a gift from friends so having duplicates of the stories was not a big problem with us. Interspersed between the stories is what seems to be an advertisement for the 'Day Out With Thomas.' It is interesting to watch but is not informative for one actually thinking about participating in one of the programs.ABOUT THE STORIES",5.0
" My son has several of the Thomas DVDs and while he's just as content to watch any of them this is his favorite. The episodes with Bertie and Terrance are great. Overall a wonderful collection of earlier Thomas narrated by George Carlin. The interviews with kids are cute and provide more than just the usual shots of various engines. I find this DVD better than the 'Best of' engines ones because of the variety. Plus my son has no clear favorite and enjoys watching them all. ",5.0

" Anyone who wants to understand the movies of the Soviet Union should start with this book. It is very thorough and written in a lively bright style that is free of academic jargon.Kenez begins with the pre-Revolutionary film industry and shows how it broke down and was built back up by the Soviets. He pays equal attention to the 'high art' films that were famous in the West for decades (those of Eisenstein and Pudovkin) and the entertainment films that attracted the average Soviet citizen (such as the musical comedies of the 1930s like 'Volga-Volga.') He shows how Soviet movies responded to the imposition of Socialist Realism World War II and the cultural freeze of the late Stalin era.The only problem with this book is that it is TOO SHORT. Upon reaching the end the reader wants to see Kenez tackle the films of the Khrushchev Thaw and the Brezhnev era. However one should be thankful for what one has and in this volume one has a truly indispensible book. ",5.0

" This book was awesome. A fast paced riveting novel by an author I am coming to find just CANNOT disappoint me. I am hooked on her Carpathians and now find that I will run just as fast to the bookstore when her next gothic comes out.THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a terrific love story and mystery set in a supposedly cursed castle that has everything from grinning gargoyles to an impressive maze. The hero and heroine are just as riveting in their fascinatin for each other and then their entanglement in the mystery of THE SCARLETTI CURSE. I highly recommend this book to all readers Feehan fan or not. But be warned by the time you turn the last page of this book you will be hooked on Christine Feehan. ",5.0

You can use any search engine to get to it. But this book really is wonderful! It can really stand on it's own! I can't wait for more from this author. The publishing company needs to publish her stuff quicker than this! Can't wait till Darius's story Dark Fire! Feel free for anyone to e-mail with any questions! I'll sell you on these books! ",5.0
" The heroine Nicoletta is the village healer. Overlord Don Giovanni exercises his right to select a village girl as his bride and chooses Nicoletta against her wishes. His home the Palazzio is a foreboding place mysterious and frightening to the villagers...a place with a history of death. Giovanni is able to communicate with Nicoletta mind to mind...the only similarity to the Dark Series Heroes...bringing a subtle sensuality to their burgeoning relationship...a welcome change from the 'pounce on each other in the first chapter' genre. Feehan continues to bring us dark heroes and independant heroines who find love in the sharing of each others gifts. ",5.0

I started to read it and in the first chapter it grabbed me and I couldn't put it down. I read it in one day (of course I got no work done) but it was well worth it.

" I became a fan of Christine's writing through her 'Dark' series and although this ventured into different territory I was not disappointed. Christine's style and gift for writing wonderful heroes and heroines along with a fascinating story is not lost. Nicoletta is a strong compassionate courageous heroine that learns to make the best of a frightening and seemingly hopeless situation. She is forced into marriage with the mysterious Giovanni Scarletti who's reputation of darkness and danger strikes fear in the hearts of most in her village. To make matters worse once married she will be forced to live in the cursed Scarletti palazzo secretly nicknamed the 'Palazzo Della Morte' where few women who enter manage to escape with their lives. Despite her hesitation she soon discovers there is a powerful attraction between she and Giovanni and seeks to unravel the mystery surrounding her own mother's death in the castle years ago. Is Giovanni the monster her fellow villagers whispered he was or could there be much more to him than she first imagined? Giovanni is just the type of hero I enjoy like the heroine he is one that can both frighten me yet manage to touch my heart at the same time. The story kept me on the edge of my seat. For fans of the paranormal there is that aspect as well. Nicoletta is gifted with a healing power and Giovanni has the power to speak directly into your mind. Kudos to Christine for the many hours of enjoyment her novels provide! ",5.0
" Ms. Feehan has written another entertaining and engrossing book. I got very little sleep the day I sat down to read Scarletti Curse I didn't stop until I had read every page.Ms. Feehan's gothic bears her trademark paranormal touch. The hero Don Giovanni Scarletti has telepathic abilities and the heroine Nicoletta has healing abilities. While helping the Don's sick niece Nicoletta catches the eye of the Giovanni who decides that he wants her for his bride. Nicoletta is less than thrilled at that honor since both her mother and aunt were killed under suspicious circumstances while employed at Palazzo Scarletti a.k.a Palazzo della Morte (palace of death). Thus begins the tale of our fair hero and heroine. Will the Don be able to win Nicoletta`s heart? Should Nicoletta trust Giovanni? Will Nicoletta be the next victim of the Scarletti curse? What dark secret is the Scarletti family hiding? Strap up and get ready for one heck of ride as Nicoletta and Giovanni learn things that they never expected about themselves and each other.Looking forward to reading more from this author. ",5.0

" I really love The Scarletti Curse having reread it for more than 5 times I believe.The pacing is good with enough action excitement and unconditional love (a necessity to destroy the evil curse at work).The book starts with village girl Nicoletta being summoned to accompany the village 'healer' Maria Pia who raised Nicoletta since her mother's death to the Scarletti Palazzo. They keep this charade to prevent the people at the palazzo knowing about Nicoletta's extraordinary healing powers (this heritage is explained in the Carpathian book 'Dark Symphony in which the lifemate is a descendant of the main characters/couple). As Maria Pia is a midwife herself this causes no problem.At the palazzo the patients turned out to be Don Giovanni Scarletti and his niece Sofia suffering from food poisoning. While both 'healer' and assistant do their work Don Scarletti keeps observing Nicoletta asking her questions when Maria Pia fell asleep and after many dissatisfying non-answers says 'I am not so blind as you and the healer seem to think'!A few days later the 'healer' and assistant were summoned to the palazzo again but this time Nicoletta knows that no one is ill. Maria Pia therefore went back to the Palazzo with another assistant but this assistant is old and when asked about Nicoletta kept telling the Don how wonderful and extraordinary she really is. This gives Don Giovanni a reason to choose a bride at The Bridal Convent. His choice is Nicoletta who gets escorted (begging and struggling) back to the palazzo by the Don.In the following days up to and after the wedding arguments heat up a few murders commited the staff gossip while Nicoletta grows into the role of the Lady of the Palazzo. ",5.0
" What an excellent book. Great use of characters and character growth. The chracters are revealed slowly in layers. Multidimensional supporting characters. There are a pair of young girls that are so well created you can hear the russle of their gowns and the patter of their feet running down the palazzo's corridors. A mystery that grows slowly throughout the book. Wonderful sense of the time and place. I have cried 3 times while reading this book.The level of mystery and intrigue reminds me of her Ghostwalker series which has the same depth of conspiracy interwoven into the romance.This is certainly one of Christine Feehan's defining works.

" The Scarletti Curse is absolutely wonderful. Ms. Feehan once again created a lively well written work that stand far apart from her Dark series (which I also adore). With complex and dark characters this book has quite a lot of bite and more than enough romance for a true fan of Christine's work. I highly recommend this book for one and all. ",5.0
" If you're a fan of Christine Feehan you already know some of the elements you'll find in this book - beautiful courageous spirited heroine and strong intelligent handsome tortured hero. Christine Feehan has put these elements in play in such exciting ways in her Dark series that she's raised the bar incredibly for Paranormal romance. It's hard to picture anyone writing about noble vampire-like creatures in a more exciting sensuous just flat out stunning way. This book though not about the vampire-like beings in her others adds an exciting Gothic twist to Christine's writing and a clever mystery to her incredibly involving characterizations. The suspenseful ending is very exciting and the reader is not sure until the end how the book will resolve. I particularly loved Nicoletta's free-spirited naturalist perspective; her grounded innocence makes such a compelling counterpoint to Don Scarletti's cursed magnificence. I own every Christine Feehan book and recommend them ALL. This is a fitting addition to her wonderful writing. ",5.0

Problem with wanting to marry her is all the women his family has chosen for their brides ends up dead. But he is not going to let that stop him from getting Nicoletta.

" I have read almost all of Ms. Feehan's books but I think this has become one of my favorites. I was kind of hesitant to buy it because it wasn't part of the Dark Series and I wasn't sure I'd like it. Once I saw the price though I decided to take a chance. After reading the first chapter I knew my worries were TOTALLY unfounded. I was hooked! And to my surprise the story is about an ancestor of Antonietta Scarletti (the female lead of 'Dark Symphony'). I could NOT put it down! I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys romance novels or anyone who likes a good read. ",5.0

" While I am not usually a fan of books where the hero is overly domineering I must concede that Christine Feehan writes so well that I enjoy her novels even though the men are so controlling and obsessive it would be frightening in real life.'The Scarletti Curse' is not a part of the Carpathian series but I found myself enjoying it as much if not more. The heroine is a healer but in a time where she could be burned at the stake should this secret gift be discovered. In order to protect herself she pretends to be a healers apprentice. Unfortunately the one man she wishes to hide this talent from Giovanni Scarletti is not fooled.Like much of Feehan's work the story is very gothic in feel and the villain(s) are truly horrible. While the hero is constantly swooping in and saving the heroine it becomes more of a joke between the two of them than a tiresome what-a-stupid-girl scenario.I was leary of this novel after being dissappointed with 'Lair of the Lion.' This novel is much much better. If you like her Carpathian series or are interested in paranormal romance this is a good book to read. ",5.0
" No female whether they are of the blood or through marriage survives THE SCARLETTI CURSE. They all violently die. One of the villagers Nicoletta knows first hand that her own mother was a victim of the curse. Still she lives life to the fullest and uses her abilities to heal people. Her guardian helps hide the secret that Nicoletta has empathic talents by fostering the idea she is just the village healer to keep her safe from Giovanni Scarletti.However the kind Nicoletta helps cure ailing lass suffering from dining on a contaminated meal with her uncle Giovanni. He immediately realizes that Nicoletta is his life mate and will protect her from his enemies but will his need to keep her safe end up making him follow the footsteps of his ancestors who loved so deep they killed for love?Though there is a political sidebar that adds suspense to the tale this gothic story line belongs to the two lead characters. Nicoletta is the classic heroine willing to do the right thing even at the cost of her own life. Giovanni is the dark brooding alpha male wanting to also do the right thing for his people and especially his beloved. Toss on top of the key theme a bit of the paranormal and readers have Christine Feehan's intrepid venture outside the Carpathian realm (see her 'Dark' series) into a totally different sub-genre that proves she is a versatile talent who deserves a wide readership.Harriet Klausner ",5.0
" The ancient dons worshipped the old gods honoring their pagan heritage and building the palazzo in defiance of the Holy Church. Two centuries ago the Scarletti family was cursed and now for years there have been rumors of murders and assignations. Indeed the palazzo itself feels evil to sensitive Nicoletta a woman who is known to be 'different' in her gifts to heal to listen to the wind to sense danger. So when the mesmerizing Don Scarletti chooses her to be his bride Nicoletta knows every bride who entered the palazzo is doomed.Nicoletta roamed the hills surrounding her village before the don's choice of her curtailed her activities to the palazzo. She had sworn no man would command her but when she fled her home to hide the don followed her luring her with his own gift. The don's darkly sensual voice erotic and seductive entices her imagination and her womanhood linking her to the man she would flee.Don Scarletti knows well the dangers that lurk upon his land. Political upheaval and family secrets threaten the woman he takes as wife as well as the others dependent upon him. He carefully guards his own gifts from others than his chosen bride. Only Nicoletta can reach through his icy aloofness to the passionate man concealed within.As a new comer to Christine Feehan's work I had very high expectations based on other reader's reactions and I am not disappointed. Written with a sensuous style a deep understanding for history and a respect for both Christianity and Paganism THE SCARLETTI CURSE contains a fast paced plot and dynamic characterizations. All the classic gothic elements keep the pages turning including the dark castle with gargoyles warnings from natural elements portents from ravens secret passageways family secrets and multiple dead wives. Further the strong heroine isn't too perfect; the troubled hero still maintains his strength amid his human failings while the gothic elements lend the perfect depth and shadow. Very highly recommended. ",5.0
" From the back of the book...Strange twisted cravings and hideous gargoyles adorned the palazzo of the great Scarletti family. But a still more fearful secret lurked within its storm-tossed turrets. For every bride who entered its forbidding walls was doomed to leave in a casket.Mystical and unfettered Nicoletta had no terror of ancient curses and no fear of marriage...until she looked into the dark mesmerizing eyes of Don Scarletti. She had sworn no man would command her had thought her gift of healing set her apart but his was the right to choose a bride from among his people. And he had chosen her.Compelled by duty drawn by desire she gave her body into his keeping and prayed the powerful tormented Don would be her heart's destiny and not her soul's demise. ",5.0
" I continue to love the work of Ms Feehan. She is a wonderful storyteller. Her books never seem to get old and tired.Giovanni and Nicolette come together to make a wonderful love story. They are both 'different' in a world were those differences could get them burned at the stake. Giovanni can read and talk to peoples minds. Nicolette has the ability to heal with her hands. They come together over a child's sick bed.Giovanni realizes that Nicolette is the women he has been dreaming about and is determine to marry her. She is his light in the darkness that seems to surround him and his family.Nicolette is a free spirit that runs around in bare feet. Raising plants for medicine and enjoying her freedom. She always seems to be in trouble.This is a warm and wonderful story that everyone should read. ",5.0

" Hawthorne's gentle charming collection of classic myths retold for the children of his day is a neglected classic. Addressing the reader in personable Victorian fashion his prose is clear and beautiful. Consider this sample",5.0
" Once upon a time (I was about 8) a family friend handed down his Collier's Junior Classic series to me - each volume is a glorious hodgepodge of short stories from here there and everywhere. I got to be very fond of Greek mythology especially 'The Chimaera' and 'The Miraculous Pitcher' since the Collier retellings of their respective legends were much more lively than the ordinary.Alas I forgot the name of the author of 'The Chimaera' and even that my favourite versions of the myths were all written by the same person. Some talented guy writing for the series no doubt I would have said if I'd thought about it. A couple of years ago I started browsing through an impressive-looking illustrated volume of mythology in a bookstore (which you now see before you). Whoa. 'Scarlet Letter' Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote *THESE*?His retellings of Greek myths were originally spread over 2 volumes (the other being _Tanglewood Tales_) but they can be obtained in a single volume these days. I can personally do without the gang of Tanglewood kids providing the official audience for the stories-within-a-story or the defense against critics put into the mouth of the storyteller Eustace Bright but then I want more space for more myths. ",5.0
" One day last week I could not even after hours of deliberation (the snow had made engagements scarce) decide what book to read next. I finally came upon this little volume on the end of my parent's bookshelf and decided to give it try. How could I have known what charms were in store? I felt like a little girl again and as Eustace Bright the ambitious college student who narrates these tales held his little auditors in awe my eyes too were wide with wonder. It truly is a 'wonder book' full of high fantasy thrilling action and the inimitable imagery of a master. Though geared towards 'boys and girls' Hawthorne explains in his introduction that 'children possess an unestimated sensibility to whatever is deep or high in imagination or feeling so long as it is simple . . . It is only the artificial and complex that bewilder them.' Indeed; the book hardly condescends and so will gently stretch the middle-grader's vocabulary. But readers -- or listeners -- of all ages will delight in this collection of tales for I was equally if not more entertained by the introductories and postludes to each story which relate the antics and dialogue of Eustace and the little children he entertains. These interludes also expand the stories by slipping in commentary and interpretation.Don't pass this one by; it will truly win your heart whoever you may be! ",5.0
" I ordered this book as part of a third grade curriculum for my son. These Everyman titles are really wonderful-- beautiful binding heavy pages amazing illustrations. I was not disappointed with this book. It is the kind of book we will read again and again and hopefully pass on to the next generation. Hawthorne's rendition of the myths and fables is classic and engaging and Rackham's illustrations are worth the price on their own. ",5.0
" If you've read Hawthorne's longer works you might be surprised by the storytelling fun and energy he puts into this shorter book aimed at boys and girls of all ages 8 to 80 who love a good yarn. Imagine yourself on a whispery wintery day sledding on the hillsides with friends. Or imagine yourself gathered with the kids on the front porch on a golden summery afternoon. Now add to these settings Hawthorne's inventive narrator Eustace Bright who gathers the children round on that hillside or porch and gives them the classic myths with his own unique spins.If you think you know the stories of King Midas and his golden touch of Hercules' exploits of Medusa you have here the chance to rediscover them in child-friendly yet fully adventurous form through the skills of Mr. Nathaniel Hawthorne. He gives the old tales a lot of charm makes them palatable for younger kids and weaves in lessons of ethics and morality and courage. I have always appreciated Hawthorne's more thought-provoking writings but here I find another side to the man and the writer that is magical and light. To add to the wonder I not only have the paperback version but also read this in an e-book format enjoying the beautiful drawings of Arthur Rackham.I've long been a fan of Hawthorne's short stories. While he plays out some amazing themes and characters in 'A Scarlet Letter' 'House of the Seven Gables' and even 'The Blithedale Romance' he excels in his shorter tales where the prose has less room to run off track and the themes are better addressed. He seems serious in most of his writing with only hints of his humor and playfulness but in 'A Wonder Book for Boys and Girls' we find a side of Hawthorne that's hard not to adore. ",5.0

" This is a great kid's desk. After 3 years of heavy use the desk continues to work great and has retained it's durability. It's the the perfect size for kids ages 4-9 years old to do their homework or other projects. The built in hutch is fantastic for organizing papers homework workbooks etc. It is easy to assemble and the honey color looks great. It is neutral enough to work with any color scheme. Although it may seem on the pricey side for a kids desk if you do any comparison shopping you will find that is well worth the money. The quality and durability is well worth it. ",5.0
" Impressive quality. Solid wood really nicely evenly stained wood with excellent layout clear instructions and very nicely packaged parts for assembly. A beautiful set. My daughter (almost 6yrs old) is going to be amazed when she sees it in the place where her old/antiquated art table used to be.Another selling point is the customer service at KidKraft. I noted that the overall quality and finish was really great except for one piece of the front of the hutch which was pretty good but had an imperfection that was filled in with well-colormatched well-sanded wood filler. My daughter would not have noticed it but it bothered me. I decided to call customer service an 800 number to see if they'd have any opinion on it. I figured they'd explain that wood is wood is never perfect that kind of thing is within tolerances et cetera... but before I even finished describing the issue the very kind rep (a live person who answered on the first ring - wow!) was asking me for my shipping address apologizing and stating they'd get a perfect piece out to me right away. She told me to go ahead and assemble the pieces that I had then when the new piece comes just swap it in without even dealing with sending back to them the imperfect piece. Just like that. Done. Instead of me apologizing and pleading my case SHE was apologizing and stated that she would personally make sure that I'd be satisfied.Amazing. ",5.0
" This item arrived well packed and undamaged. It looks exactly like the picture was fairly easy to assemble and is sturdy and well made. Of course it is an 'assembly required' piece of furniture but once put together it looks like a really nice quality piece. My daughter loves it. It is sized for a child and is too small for an adult. I think she'll be able to use it through age 11 or 12. It also has a convenient hole in the back of the hutch for her computer wire to poke through. I looked at this item EVERYWHERE including eBay and Amazon was the cheapest of all. The chair comes included so don't buy an extra chair separately! ",5.0

It is a great size for our 3 and 5 year old and I believe will fit them well for many more years. My wife just started homeschooling our 5 year old and the desk works great. Very stable you'll love it. We have no complaints at all. Some of the information as far as heights go is a little confusing in the description. The top of the desk is just shy of 24' and the top of the hutch is just shy of 30'. As far as the chair goes the seat itself is about 14' so it is all sized quite well for your little ones. They don't have to sit on thier knees to work at their desk. You can't go wrong with this one. And you will not find a better bargian.

I searched high and low and this is the best deal. ",5.0
" This desk is definitely worth the money. My daughter wanted a white desk with a hutch and had picked out many over [...] not including the chair. I ordered this one without her knowing and at first she was upset because the hutch is not that big. But once it was assembled she loves it. She is 8 and loves the little cubbies in the hutch. Everything is packaged nicely and there was not one scratch or ding or funny smells. The hardware had everything you needed (no extras) in separate baggies for the chair and desk. I put it together myself in about 1 hour. We did replace the knob with a blue glass knob from the hardware store just to make it a little more unique I guess and it looks great. With free supersaver shipping and no sales tax there is no better buy out there. Trust me I have looked! ",5.0

I think they will be great as my kids get older too whether they want to just use it as a writing desk or to put a laptop or computer screen and keyboard on them. Highly recommend these desks and at a great price.

We did change the knob (the knob it came with was a simple wooden knob. Not horrible but for a couple of dollars at the hardware store you can get a beautiful knob.)

" I purchased this desk for my 7-year old grandson and while it wasn't the most exciting Christmas present he received it was probably one of the most practical (which is why I gave it a low score on 'fun'). It's a very nice piece of furniture and appears to be very sturdy. He loves having all his 'stuff' for school in one place and is now able to do his homework in the peace and quiet of his room. The desk appeared a little larger than we had envisioned (knowing the dimensions doesn't quite prepare you for the actual 'impact' of the item in the room) but it ended up fitting quite nicely in his room. I would say that after an average-size child reaches age nine or ten this desk would be too small. ",5.0

" When I think of Heart's 1985 self-titled album I feel it should be renamed 'Resurgence'! Meaning this was their 'comeback' album after what everyone thought they were just wilting and fading away several years earlier. It seems like when Heart was popular with 'Dreamboat Annie' ten years earlier they were on top to stay. However when the 1980s began many rock artists were forgotten and to never be heard from again. Not Heart! Sure they were lost in the early 80s because of the MTV explosion and the world was living on 'Thriller'. Capitol's bold gamble paid off",5.0
" In 1985Heart made their Capitol Records debut with their self-titled album. The band themselves debuted in 1976 on Epic. They were dropped from Epic in 1983following the release of PASSIONWORKS. Bass guitarist Mark Andes was a member of the disbanded Firefallwhose hits included JUST REMEMBER I LOVE YOU and YOU ARE THE WOMAN. Now for the songs",5.0
" This is the best Heart album ever made in my opinion. I grew up listening to Heart and I still listen to them. I saw Ann and Nancy in concert last year they were awsome as usual. My favorite song is 'These Dreams'. Another good song is 'What About Love'. Heart has had numerous #1 hits and it's amazing people still love to listen to them. ",5.0
" I liked this album since it debuted. The radio stations in Chicago played the hell out of the singles. 9 good songs. The only one I didn't care for is ' What He Don't Know'.Ann was gaining alot of weight around this time and in the video's her body is blocked by props on stage or the camera zooms in for jsut head shots of her singing. She's still got a strong powerful voice. ",5.0
" I honestly think that the first song I ever heard was either 'If Looks Could Kill' or 'What About Love'. At the time I would've only been two or three but my older brother and sister had this record. I stole it from one of them and ever since Heart has been my favorite band of all time. This album is without a doubt their best work ever. The only slight weak spot being 'Nobody Home' but it's still a good song. It just doesn't fit the album very well. Ann's voice is raw and ethereal and the way Nancy plays the guitar is too great for words. So if you love this kind of music. Then you must have this record in your collection.Also Recommended",5.0
" In late 1984 after Ann Wilson had success with Mike Reno (lead singer of Loverboy) on their duet 'Almost Paradise' for the 1984 film 'Footloose' Heart regrouped with Ann Wilson Nancy Wilson Howard Leese Mark Andes and Denny Carmassi to start recording another album. Their last two albums had flopped and they had decided to go in another direction",5.0
" This is the album that brought Heart back on top of the scene. They scored many top ten hits here and there first number one hit 'These Dreams'. I personally think this is there best work to date and has some of the best songs on it. 'Never' is my favorite song on the album. I am not a huge Heart fan so it does not bother me as much they sold out but as long as they made good music it doesn't really matter. i recommend this album as Heart's best album to date. ",5.0
" Heart was back and bigger than ever. 'Heart' was a last ditch effort to keep the band together. If it failed Heart would no longer exist. Well history shows what happened.MTV made four videos for this album and they made Nancy Wilson every teenager's dream girl. Ann was always my favorite sister and she looked real good too. MTV milked this album for all it was worth and Heart was now an official '80's band' like it or not. This album brought a breath of life into their career that seemed to be standing still.Besides the singles I always liked 'The Wolf' but 'Shell Shock' was by far the hardest loudest most rockin' tune on the whole album.

" What The Cure was to new wave/punk Heart was to rock n' roll. These songs overflowed with all the passion excitement romance and love that typical meat and potatoes male rockstars of the era felt too embarrassed to express. On this album Heart is easy listening hard rock and progressive new wave pop all at the same time. There's an excellent balance of guitar and synth with thrillingly uplifting moments and heart-melting ballads. The Wilson sister's vocals are lush throughout but what really stands out are the songs themselves.'If Looks Could Kill' is a solid dramatic rocker. 'What About Love' is a dynamic ballad that features Grace Slick on backround vocals. Howard Leese lays a fine guitar solo. The last half minute pulsates double time with unbelievable excitement and conviction. You'll continue to hear the song in your head even after you turn off your stereo. 'Never' is sexy and serious at the same time.Written by Bernie Taupin 'These Dreams' has to be among the very best ballads of the 80's. This is Heart at its most romantic and seductive. It's medieval lyrical imagery gives it a timeless appeal. The song emblazons a gorgeous fantasy world upon your emotions. It's a better four minutes than any drug could ever give you.'The Wolf' uses primal imagry to put down the unwanted advances of sleazy guys. It's guitar solo will floor you with a determined and indomitable hopefullness! 'All Eyes' scores again with an alternately sexy seductiveness and lovestruck passion. 'You don't have to say a word to get a hold of me/take me...shake me/Burning gravity baby/Look at me look at me'. What guy wouldn't love to hear those words from his girlfriend? And there's another triumphant guitar solo that's brimming with happiness. The plaintive ballad 'Nobody Home' is beautiful.'Nothin' At All' has a pure pop genius. It's got that top of the world 80's happiness to it. The guitar solo is simple yet very satisfying. The almost country 'What He Don't Know' is a decent soft rock ballad. The closer 'Shell Shock' is a bit cheesy but displays an ample pop rock sensibility.This album is very happy warm and hopefull. But unlike the shallowness of most pop music it's happy in a deep and meaningful way. When you feel like the daily grind has bled away your passion this album is the antidote. ",5.0
" If there was a recording or type of music that represents the music of my life it would be mid-'80s Heart music. This music affected me more than any other recordings I ever bought. I have never listened to a recording so many times as I did this 1985 release after buying it.It's a high-powered rock recording with power ballads mixed in. I saw a Heart arena stage show in NorfolkVA in September of 1985 and may lightning strike me dead if I am not 101% honest in saying that I have never been so stunned impressed blown away awestruck mesmerizedor captivated by anything in life like I was by Ann Wilson's lightning bolt performance and stupendously glorified stage appearance along with Heart's incredible stage energy and unmatched professionalism in the live execution of this 1985 recording.Every song on here is good. Too bad there isn't a DVD of Heart's 1985 music. Over twenty years ago this recording came out and I am still so profoundly affected by this recording & Heart's 1985 show. Ann & Nancy really struck gold recording these songs and their live `85 performance put me in a state of awe that I never felt before or after this show. I have never been thrilled like that by anything ever! Heart's 1985 recording is more than just music to me it was an unforgettable life experience that's part of me forever. This CD is a memory picture of that experience.Hopefully a Heart 1985 CD will come out that has bonus mid 1980s songs on it (like 'Love Takes Over' which is on youtube as of 2011). I still have the cassette for this recording and can attest that this cd sounds like instruments are missing or severely faded especially on 'If Looks Could Kill.' Something isn't right with the process that put this recording on a cd. ",5.0

" Heart 'Heart' #1 (1985).The airbrushed Heart on the cover of their debut album with Capitol in 1985 was quite a shock but the music is what mattered and they delivered. The album begins with the synth rocker 'If Looks Could Kill' #54 hot 100 they reached the top 10 again (after 5 years) with the power ballad 'What About Love' #10 hot 100 and #3 MSR. 'Never' #4 hot 100 and #2 MSR is a nice little pop rocker. Sister Nancy sings on the sleepy power ballad 'These Dreams' #1 hot 100 (their first #1) and #2 MSR. The 80's sounding hard rock of 'Wolf' 'All Eyes' and 'Shell Shock'. You also get the not mentioned enough 'Nobody Home'. 'Nothin' At All' #10 hot 100 and #6 MSR another fine pop-rocker. The only song that doesn't hit home was 'What He Don't Know'. They would come back two years later in 1987 with 'Bad Animals'. ",5.0

Not only did the Wilson sisters look totally gorgeous (Nancy practically makes love to her guitar as she throws her legs around in the videos for this album) but they selected a series of songs which reflected the popularity of soft rockl at the time without abandoning their vocal & musical prowess. 5 million album sales later proved that Heart had returned with style while delivering both a commercial & gutsy opus. What are now rock classix These Dreams (US no.1 & UK Top 10) & What About Love (US & UK Top 10) are contained here plus the uplifting Never (US & UK Top 10). The album is consistent with some gorgeous songs such as Nobody Home & some really gutsy rockers such as If Lools Could Kill (which remains a live! favourite) & Nothin' At All (another US Top 10 hit). The only really awful track is The Wolf which tries hard to be uniques but is really dreadful. The fportunate thing is that al other 9 tracks are that good that you forgive Heart that mishap. Moreover considering the immense leap in their creative & commercial fortunes on this album the album is destined to be a classic anyway! ",5.0
" I grew up listening to Heart on the radio and now they're still one of my favorite groups and my favorite female group of all time without a doubt. This is their best album that they made in my opinion. 'These Dreams' and 'Nothin' At All' have got to be 2 of my favorite songs ever.All the other songs even the ones that weren't hits are also good. If you're a Heart fan I recommend picking this one up without a second thought. If you can find it I would also recommend getting These Dreams",5.0
" While some think 'Heart' was nothing more than pop record are just wrong! This is one of rocks finest moments! Heart rocked with this lp in 1985 and introduced them to a wider audience Four big hits! Ann & Nancy and the band picked strong material for this project and 21yrs later(wow)it still hold up! (two of the girls on american idol have done good covers of two of the songs) even the cover photo was hot! ",5.0
" After the self titled album was released Hearts' domination of female rock was thundered home. Sadly Heart went back into the studio and ruined a couple of songs changing the guitar solo entirely on 'Nothing At All' adding some overdriven guitar power chords and changing vocal parts in 'Never'. Do not buy the Original Recording version thinking you are getting the original recording either. Heart felt that the songs were too reliant on keyboards and synths after the fact went back into the studio and added more guitars and even changing vocals. ie in 'Never' Ann originally sang the part 'walk those legs right over here'. After the studio revisit it turned into a pouty kinda spoken command 'walk those legs right over here. If you search hard enough you might find an old cassette of the original recording. I don't know how to differentiate before buying so good luck. Not to be nitpicking but when you get used to hearing a certain version you don't want it changed. ",5.0

" I suffer from chronic joint pain and severe headaches. My doctor recommened that I look into a maternity body pillow similar to this product since I could use it to support my back and hips when i sleep on my side and that by using the u-shaped pillow as my only neck and head pillow ease the muscle tension that aggravated my headaches. He was so right! I purchased this product the Comfort U pillow and once I modified a bit it was perfect. it tends to be a little too long on the sides and as a result it flattens out where your legs rest on it. It is also a little underfilled. To correct that I got two elastic hair bands and turned the U upside down so it was resting on the U. I then took the ends and shook all the stuffing down each arm until I had siz to 8 inches of empty pilow case. I wrapped the hair elastics around the ends pinching the empty part shut so that the filling couldn't get back in there. When I patted the pillow down to make the stuffing even it was nice and firm no longer had a tendency to go flat. It's an easy thing to do if you want a firmer pillow.That said I recommend that you Google a different store called 'the Comfort Store' because they sell this for the same exact price but offer free shipping which will save you over $30. be aware that the Comfort U pillow comes with one white pillow case shaped to fit the pillow. You can purchase extra pillow cases for aboyt $34. I bought one in beige and I liked it much better than the white one. it matched my yellow floral bedding. They offer a blue pillow case as well (sold separately). The money you save on shipping by buying from the Comfort Store can buy you an extra pillow case!Whatever you do consider getting this if you are a side sleeper stuffing pillows behind your back and between your legs for support. Once you get used to sleepig with this pillow with your arm underneath it and your other arm over it you'll notice you awaken less during the night to turn. My only complaint and it is a minor one is that the pillow tends to reflect your body heat back to you. I am always too warm even in airconditioning so I found cooling a gel pack in the freezer for half an hour and sliding that between my forehead and the pillow solves that problem quickly. That might not even be a problem for other people. trust me if you have joint pain this pillow is the solution. ",5.0
" I have fibromyalgia restless leg syndrome and endure much pain during the night. It was totally impossible for me to get comfortable until the Comfort U Pillow was delivered to my door. I can honestly say that it truly does help me get a better night sleep in addition to decreasing the pain. This pillow has brought me many painfree nights of sleep. ",5.0
" Out of all the products I bought for my pregnancy this was by far the best. I slept comfortably throughout my 9 mos. and still use it today. The only downfall is that your bedfellow might feel neglected. ",5.0
" I originally purchased this for my pregnancy as I was using 5+ pillows for support and i was tired of chasing them as they fell off the bed all night long. I loved the support and have slept with it ever since. (i even take it with me on trips.) its great because of the refluff-able fill and because you can roll over and not have to move it. I have yet to wash it in the laundermat and see how it turns out.one con because of its size it can be difficult to fluff... do it in the morning while you have energy not at night when you're ready to go to bed.

" This is an awesome product! I was hesitant to spend so much money on a pillow but it is worth every penny!!! I have fibromyalgia & I was pregnant when my husband ordered this pillow for me. It is wonderful. I wish I would have bought it years ago. I sleep so much better now. It is great for fibromyalgia sufferers & pregnant women. ",5.0
" I am starting my fifth month of pregnancy and bought the pillow to get used to sleeping on my sides. At first I was scared of the size and concerned it might bother my husband and my little dog that sleeps next to me. I tried it and absolutely loved it.

I am 5'11' so it is not to long for me and the pillow is just the right height for my head too. I am also a cold sleeper so the body heat reflection that another reviewer noted is a plus for me!

" I have trigger point and muscle tension problems and the extra support from the comfort U pillow has helped me sleep much more comfortably. I like to sleep on my side and realized that I was holding too much tension in my back and not relaxing enough. Now I just cocoon myself into my comfort U and tuck it in along my back and I can relax more deeply. I hate to go anywhere without it even tho' it is rather big and bulky to try to take anywhere. At first I thought it was a lot to spend on a pillow but it has been worth it. Previously I had used body pillows but the comfort U gives far more coverage and I don't have to roll my a body pillow over with me each time I roll over and my comfort U hasn't gone flat like the previous body pillow tended to do. I admit it would have been nice to have when I was pregnant too but those days are long gone. ",5.0

" It is our good fortune this collection exists to showcase the tragically ignored Payne.

" Why The Boys' self-titled release isn't universally recognized as one of the essential albums that defined the 70's punk rock phenomenon will remain beyond me. Maybe they didn't fit in because they didn't conform to the punk 'look' and because they were not sponsored by the right people. They were regarded as the Beatles of punk. The funny thing is that they were actually more punk than most bands of the movement. As far as I'm concerned their first album is the best punk rock album to come out of '77 UK. The sheer energy and overall drive of the music was nearly unparalleled at the time far ahead of the Pistols and the Clash.The music here is passionate and it has attitude; it is somewhat remniscient of the Dead Boys. This is true oldschool punk rock here the dirty kind of non-political I-don't-care rock'n'roll that set the foundation for the rest of the movement. The music is loud and energetic and the songwriting is top-notch almost too good to be punk (this may have been a reason why they were cast out). The Boys take no prisoners as they churn out classic after classic song. From the all-out rebellion that is the opener Sick On You to the f***-everything attitude of I Don't Care to the amazing Living in the City (which the Sex Pistols were never quite able to outdo in terms of raw power) you'll be turning this album up louder and louder until you can't hear anything else around you but you won't even care to.There are no weak songs here. Catchy riffs and hooks are all over the place in just about every song. This isn't punk for the sake of punk this is quality rock'n'roll that also has all the elements of punk including loud vocals distorted guitars and definitely an overall feel of youth aggression. Whereas other bands were busy coloring their hair and sticking safety pins on their clothes The Boys channeled the spirit of punk into the music itself. Do yourself a favor and buy this album if you want to hear the real deal. ",5.0

" We met Dr. Smith when recently in the Amazon in Peru. She cured my husband's plantar fascitis with a shot of lidocaine which we feel enabled him to walk properly and thus stretch the fachitis. It cost 25cents for the lidocaine and needle and he had spent way more of that in the States with a cordisone shotMRI special night boot creams to rub on his foot etc. In any event we love this woman and have begun a correspondence with her and her foundation. Her book tells how she left a thriving practice in Wisconsin to come to the Amazon and open a clinic. She is a very special lady. Her story moves quickly and is interesting. If you ever were tempted to do good in the world this woman takes you step by step on her journey. Truth is often better than fiction. ",5.0

" This is an inspiring book that's a pleasure to read. It gives the reader the vicarious enjoyment of being part of a noble endeavor. In an age of 'road rage' and the obsessive accumulation of more and more things (which often do not make us happy) it's exhilarating to experience a taste of Dr. Linnea's life.Dr. Linnea shows us how one can give up almost all the material possessions and creature comforts of the modern world and still find meaning happiness and personal fulfillment. Dr. Linnea has created for herself a significant life. A life with much to teach a troubled world.While missionaries have long sacrificed themselves to serve God win the eternal salvation of lost souls and earn a place in the pantheon of saints Dr. Linnea does it for the pure humanity of the effort. Goodness is indeed its own reward in this Amazon outpost.Because of Dr. Linnea's 'wonderful life' many lives have been enriched and some even saved. More importantly countless hours of suffering have been alleviated. This is the most humane thing",5.0
" As the author of a book about the same region HIDDEN AMAZON I found Linnea Smith's book fascinating. From Wisconsin Linnea tells why she has gone to the Amazon (she's still there) and how she feels about the conditions the jungle and the people. Perhaps most instructive is her detailed account of the medical conditions she encounters and how she treats them under the most primitive conditions. She works lives and eats at Explorama Lodge a popular stop for trekkers in the area. This is one of the few jungle lodges with a doctor on the staff. And LA DOCTORA is one of the best books about the rain forest and its medical services. ",5.0
" I met Dr Smith last month at her new clinic while vacationing on the Amazon River. This book was especially meaningful since we were in many of the places she talks about. I can understand completely why she came to the region for a vaction but never left. Her book provides a beautiful insight into the Amazon region and it's people. The Peruvian people in the Amazon have very little by American standards but they appear to be very content and happy with the lives they lead. And she chronicles this beautifully in her book both the positive and the negative aspects of practicing with very little equipment or supplies.She provides from an outsiders perspectivethe problems with practicing medicine not knowing the language and have to go thru so much 'red tape' to get the supplies and the Peruvian medical degree needed to legally treat the people she cared about.Fortunately she has been able to develop a great support system in Wisconsin people who are able to acquire the supplies needed to built and outfit her new clinic. She is a testament to the medical profession one who practice for the love of it after falling in love with one of the most beautiful areas of the world.A fantastic diary of a doctor making a real difference in the lives of people who had only the 'medicine men' of the Amazon...

You dont run into too many albums this complete from 1st track to the last. the sparse instamentation and productioin are such the canvas for Lhasa to paint her musical/vocal paintings you hear and feel such passion fire hunger distain in her voice it pulls you in and you cant help it. a nod to her collaborator Yves Desrosiers-what a fantastic musicain on a level few others achieve- playing multiple instraments with such a deft touch and a knowledge of where there place should be in the overall mix of the songs.

When shopping for a speakers this was one of the discs I always used as a reference. ",5.0
" Lhasa's voice is simply haunting. I cannot find any other way to describe it. Her interpretation although I would say it sounds extremely personal it is so emotional that it reaches way beyond her inner sanctum into the ears of any listener. The lack of major musical arrangements allows her voice to be heard in every breath. I can only compare her to Lila Dows in terms of her delivery. This album is a must have for any serious collector of world music and if you don't have any of Lila Downs I suggest you get hers too. ",5.0

If you want to spend a very very emotional moment get the CD it's a very good investissment. Special greatings to Yves Desrosiers guitarist and arranger. One of the best ones I can swear. My life has really changed since I've heard this voice so do the same and enjoy!! ",5.0
" With the recent release of Lhasa's new album I thought I'd take a moment to say how much I've loved this one. I happened upon it in a Borders listening station. It was during the brief flash of public interest in Cuban music and I guess somebody thought it fitted the mood. Well bless them for thinking so for I otherwise would never have heard it.I was pretty well sold by the first track. I had never heard such a 'rainy' song - it is held together with the rhythm of rain and water and Lhasa's voice was instantly enrapturing like as (I think) Susan Power wrote 'liquid sorrow beaded on her vocal cords.' (She said that of Patsy Cline but the impression is the same.)Thank goodness for the bilingual liner notes - my four years of high school Spanish helped me catch the occasional phrase but these lyrics are too good to be misunderstood",5.0

I'm allways on the lookout for interesting artists being one myself and I've been involved in the music industry for a long time working in a recording studio. I can't tell you 'Buy This' because I think it is great-that's a personal opinion. But I can tell you 'Buy this' because I like it and so will you and anyone else you play it to.

" Este Cd ha sido mi sorpresa del ano 2006 Puede ser un CD de musica mejicana una obra maestra???. Si la respuesta es YES entonces La Llorona='Obra maestra'. Lhasa no tiene una voz de las que podriamos calificar de 'bonita' pero si que es carismatica y tremendamente expresiva. Si a ello anadimos que las canciones presentan unas letras originales con sentido y mensaje unos ritmos que se meten en tu sangre y te acompanan alla adonde vayas unos arreglos musicales 'teatrales' en el mejor sentido del termino y unos instrumentos musicales irreprochablemente bien tocados el resultado dificilmente puede mejorarse. No tengo ni idea si Lhasa esta arriba o abajo en el raking de las cantantes superventas. Pero si es lo primero....es logicoy si es lo segundo...esperemos que tarde o temprano LHASA se haga justicia con tu forma de enteder la musica. ",5.0

" I recently heard this tape being played in a shop abroad and immediately enquired what it was and ordered it from Amazon the moment I returned home.

" Growing up on the border in South Texas and traveling through much of Mexico over the yeras this recording brought back a lot of memories through De Sela's Rachera style.

" After reading all the rave reviews for the past few years I decided to break down and get this CD. The art cover closed the deal. I was even more impressed to find out she did it. Where to begin describing something so unique and different? There is only one Lhasa de Sala there is no mold so they'll be no copies. The only voices I've heard that remind me of hers are Linda Ronstandt on her excursions into Espanol and Edith Piaf. Listen to the opening track 'De Cara a la Pared' as she hauntingly invites you into her own cabaret joining in as though her voice is a violin softly seductively enticing the listener entry into her world. The comparisons to the two above mentioned artists stop there and really do no justice to her brand of music created with Yves Desprosiers. This is really a collaboration as Desprosiers pens many of the songs with her and plays no less than eight instruments! He also is the producer. Of course the focus is the voice of Lhasa but the guitar and acordian work Desporsiers lend to the CD give it the sidewalk cafe sound. It is not just her vocals and the beautiful arrangements but the cutting lyrics that stand on their strength alone. Although the songs are all entirely in Spanish a non-Spanish speaker can understand the songs because the booklet is bilingual. To say that Lhasa's songs lament would be an understatement the pain comes out in her voice even if you don't understand Spanish. There is a mysterious quality to the songs a spiritual quality music from deep within her soul La Llorona cries out. I like to say which songs I particularly like but all the songs are strong and stand out with individual characteristics. If I had to pick one song it would be 'Los Peces' because of it's theme The Virgin Mary and the simple poetic lyrics she so eloquently demonstrates. The CD is a triumph for a first effort and will probably be hard to match. Although considering the talent and her last words in her acknowledgments 'Viva La Evolucion' she probably will make another stunning piece of music. If you like Gypsyesque-Spanish music tinged with folkloric Argentinian and Mexican melodies soulful interplay into categories undefined but refreshingly fresh this is a CD for you. I suspect Lhasa has much more to say and those that heard this CD will be waiting for her sophmore effort. I should have bought it long ago. ",5.0
" Some of Lhasa's songs on 'La Llorona' sound like they could have come from a Parisian (or Montreal) bistro as easily as from Mexico. Some songs feature accordion and klezmer. Lhasa de Sela is a Mexican-American who lived in Montreal until recently. She grew up travelling across Mexico and the United States in a schoolbus.'La Llorona' (the Wailing Woman) is the name of a legendary Mexican woman who threw her children into the river in her anger and jealousy. The villagers found her dead as well the next morning and her ghost continued to roam the earth wailing for her lost children. That title is appropriate enough for this splendid unexpected collection of songs (only three are not original).Lhasa's voice is haunting much like the mythical wail of 'La Llorona.' There is an urgency and passion in her singing. My favourite song has to be 'De cara a la pared' a haunting waltz with unusual sound effects (rain splashing musical saw). I heard Lhasa for the first time on the Canadian TV series Due South which actually introduced me to a host of lesser-known Canadian talent. I fell in love with the songs and rushed out to buy 'La Llorona.'This is my absolute favourite Spanish-language CD in my collection. It is mysterious uplifting joyful and energetic like Mexico itself. If you're looking for something uniquely Mexican in flavour something mysterious passionate and soulful or simply a change from the ordinary look no further than Lhasa de Sela's 'La Llorona.' ",5.0
" I heard Lhasa de Sela last June in San Francisco at the Lilith Festival. Although I myself am a struggling musician with my own CD's to sell I was enthusiastic enough to want to buy several copies of La Llorona. Unfortunately it wasn't availabe in the US and over the past several months I had searched for a copy to no avail. I was given the CD last week and have listened to it non-stop since.Lhasa and her band are obviously deeply steeped in the traditional music of Mexico Argentina Spain and Central Europe. But she has an authentic and original voice that is able to transform those influences into something truly original and transcendent. When you hear her voice and melodies you know she speaks the truth. She sings like a woman of passion who has no place in her life for cynicism or boredom.Luckily she has a band that knows exactly how to support her vision. The music balances on a strange edge between the haunted loneliness of flamenco and and the topsy-terviness of a small-time circus band.I will be buying several copies of this CD. ",5.0
" I've been listening to Lhasa De Sela all summer in the bistro where I wash dishes. Every time it plays Life seems to become more poignant. I can feel the clients en-Joying their food just that much more we are all trance-ported to the rythmns of this exotic and hauntingly beautiful music.I finally borrowed it to make a tape for myself. I was surprised to realise the singing is in Spanish. The music is just that international that the actual language is of the Heart!I have one critisism",5.0
" This is a masterpiece. Lhasa has a unique and powerful voice - flexible sexy and captivating. So subtle in its beauty it will make you tremble. And the laments will crush your heart.

" It's such a shame how relatively unknown this series is. Granted it does not appeal to everyone as it is a very subtle and quiet series. The genre is historical romance set in Victorian England.

However I only wish they dubbed it as well...I would've loved to hear it in English since the story is set in England after all. ",5.0
" This second set of Emma begins with a textbook example of how to do a recap episode as Vivian's reading of Romeo and Juliet prompts Hakim to coyly recount to the audience what's happened so far in the grand fashion of a Shakespearean prologue. As it ends with him proclaiming that the 'Second Act' is about to begin we're off with the continuing story of Emma and William.As it begins Mrs. Stowner's sad but natural passing has left Hakim - who isn't going to be in England forever - as the only remaining champion of Emma and William's relationship. Emma is fortunately not out on the streets as she's quickly employed by mischievous unconventional German expatriate Dorothea Molders - the woman she met at the train station at the end of the last set - who turns out to be a wonderful employer. Meanwhile to Hakim's disappointment and dismay William proposes to Eleanor in an attempt to please his father and forget Emma.Of course this is a romance so an outrageous coincidence throws Emma and William together again and William realizes his terrible mistake. But by that time Emma has started spending time with Mrs. Molders' gruff but kind handyman Hans with whom she has alot in common - and if William humiliates Eleanor and the Campbell family by breaking the engagement at a late stage it might ruin his father's business his brothers' employment prospects and his sisters' marriage prospects all in one shot in addition to profoundly hurting Eleanor who he doesn't love but considers a friend...Can William convince Emma that they can defy convention as well as convince his family that she is worth the financial downsizing they might all face if he leaves Eleanor for Emma?The answer is no surprise pretty much given away in the new opening sequence and by the fact that Hakim's one-episode prologue is delivered in a fairly light tone in spite of the Romeo and Juliet springboard. It's the execution of the story that's so wonderful. The new cast members are engaging and the scenery of the Molders' country estate expands the Victorian world largely limited to the stunning depiction of London in the first set.Ultimately Emma ranks at the highest level of slice of life anime and is a must for the collection of any fans of that subgenre - as well as period piece fans or even anyone who simply wants a change from the action/adventure genre of most anime.

" Emma season 2 was a surprise. It felt much more grand than its subdued classy first season.In season 2 of Emma our main character moves away from London to get away from the struggle of her affair with a noble and begins life as a maid in Germany where her first day is met with an accusation of theft. Things lead to an emotional but very happy ending and Emma finds herself a favorite among the maids and the masters of the house. Emma's love Will back in London can not get her out of his mind and falls into depression but finds comfort in Miss Campbell a sweet noble girl. The two begin to fall in love. Things seem to go smoothly until Emma and Will's lives cross paths again and the story takes a dramatic turn.Nozomi's release comes with perfect subtitles and a great set of extras. It's a quality release.I can't recommend Emma enough for anyone who loves a good story. ",5.0
" In Season Two we see Emma and William living apart in two households which when you come down to it are both upper crust but have different views on class money power and their places in the universe. As one review pointed out this is a very subtle and quiet anime and many people may not enjoy it or even watch it because it just isn't their thing. Like the first DVD set this one has a extra in the form of a book with few extras within the DVDs themselves. It is also like the first DVDs subtitled. It WOULD have been nice to hear English voices but I don't mind that much. On the other hand would have been nice to hear the German accent of the Molders maybe?Like the first series the plot is realistic and the characters very solid very aware of their place. They are characters of their time and don't pretend to have 21st Century values in a 19th Century world. And I still want to kick William in the butt - he is such a good character that he REALLY generates a emotional response from me. Mostly the need to smack him around.And the character of Monica felt off. The Campbell family came off as so proper and aware of their image...yet they allow the oldest girl to dress and act like that?!?!? Funny thing is I was starting to feel sorry for the Campbell family till...well that be spoilers. I guess the Japanese needed a villain for the piece. I think it would have been better off if they left out the Bad Guy and let the lovers have to deal with the real problem - deciding if their love was important enough to break away from their class their culture and their society. Would they be strong enough to believe in themselves? Sad to say we will never really know. The ending was not as realistic as I would have hoped and did leave some loose ends. True it suggests happy endings for all but we all know that there would be a LOT of fallout from such a ending.Enjoy with good English Black Tea (from India) and scones (from Scotland) and try to give the Maid the day off while you watch the DVDs.

" Emma is working in a new household with a team of other maids and servants. Certainly something she's not used to. William is seeing Eleanor Campbell. It's obvious both sides want marriage between them except for Eleanors father. You'll see why when you watch it. No matter how much William told his father he loved Emma in part one he's totally against him being with her. He wants William to marry into title to secure their place in the gentry.Eleanor is foolishly head-over-heels in love with William even though William has admitted that he just doesn't want to be lonely and likes her company. There is a scene that will floor you about how desperate Eleanor is. She is so naive! I love the blast from the past which tells how Williams father and mother met.William thinks he'll never see Emma again and Emma is accepting living without him and being a maid. Eleanor's older sister tells William off and gives William an ultimatum. William proposes and Eleanor the silly girl says yes. Hakim leaves England. It's not until Emmas new employer visits her friend 'Mrs. Trollope' aka Williams mother that things get more interesting. Emma nearly ruins her chances to go to London again with her employer but when she does go she is to accompany Mrs. Trollope to a party. They dress her up and sure enough she looks like a true blue blood and all eyes are on her.Of course William and Emma meet each other at the party where she learns that he is engaged. My favorite part of the movie! I also love the support from her new employer. She stands back yet encourages the match. From William breaking the engagement Viscount Campbells revenge Emma considering Hans a fellow worker Prince Hakims return to Williams unwavering devotion to Emma as well as his family it ends with the woman who started it all. Perfect! I wish there were more movies like this. ",5.0
" Most western animation for children is to put it simply really wretched. At best it's tolerable.But a shining exception would be the tale of the Avatar of all four elements and to restore the balance in the world. The first two volumes of 'Avatar The Last Airbender ' serve as a solid start to the series -- they smoothly introduce the characters and sets up some nice story arcs without skimping on development of either.South Pole Water Tribe siblings Katara and Sokka stumble across a glowing iceberg with a young Airbender boy named Aang (and his flying bison) inside. All Airbenders were killed long ago. You guessed it (and so does Katara)",5.0

" After purchasing and watching this movie I can see why there is such a cult following. The movie was obviously made with very little budget but the quality blew me away. The movie follows a town that gets taken over by vampires. They attack innocent people and drink lots of blood. The similarities to other vampire movies stops there however. The acting in this movie is non-existent but the action explods off the screen. The gore and death scenes are great and I was shocked (Thats real blood people). Chainsaw weilding maniacs and ghouls of the night.This movie took WAY too long in production but the special features and movie transfer are WELL worth the wait.Great (Dare I say 'B') vampire genre film.Keep in mind this IS very low budget-so if you're expecting 'Blade' you will be dissapointed.

" This is an excellent two disk set filled with tons of extras. The film is a gore soaked saga pitting a group of young people against an ever growing vampire hoard. Filled with tons of bloody spurting gooey deaths it should be a delight for gore-hounds. The film moves at a nice fast pace and is never boring. Where the DVD really shines is in the extras. Multiple commentary tracks are included with the cast and crew. This commentary illustrates the love these people share for the film as well as being very insightful on the makings of low budget renegade cinema. Also included is an original cut of the film that is also worth watching to see how 'Darkenss' morphed over the years into the current version. We are also given a nice set of interviews with many of the cast as they look back on their experiences making the film. All I can say is this movie is a lot of fun-check it out. ",5.0

" I usually buy the salted version of this butter since I mostly use it for spreading and for that I like the flavor of the salted version better. That being said there are a number of recipies that call for unsalted butter and then the unsalted Lurpak is as good as you will find.Note that Lurpak is cultured butter (not sweet cream butter like most American brands) and as such it has a deep and rich flavor that no simple sweet cream butter can match. Cultured butter of this kind is produced by fermenting the cream with lactic bacteria that convert sugars to lactic acid before churning the cream into butter.In my opinion the Lurpak Danish butter holds its own in comparison with far more expensive butters. I actually prefer Lurpak over brands like Echire etc. ",5.0

" The front man for bands like Not drowning waving and My friend The Chocolate Cake has released what I consider the best CD I have heard in years. There are too many great songs on this CD to name a standout track. (Not one 'skipper') Gentle piano soundscapes over a wash of atmospheric sounds and Bridie's unique vocal arrangements make this the best CD of its kind since David Sylvian's 'Secrets of the beehive' in 1987. This is a must have for anyone that enjoys fragile but moving music. It amazes me that this CD and this artist will never get the recognition in the USA he deserves. Thanks Australia! ",5.0
" The album 'Act of Free Choice' is a superbly crafted series of songs incorporating orchestral arrangements piano balladry electronica and David Bridie's own husky lyrics. The net effect is sublime with many thoughtful ruminations on traditional Australian life and also the people of Irian Jaya whose struggle for independence from Indonesia is one of Bridie's most public causes.This album is quite unlike a typical rock or pop work and it totally eschews the hackneyed and over-produced musical fare that typically dominiates our airwaves and album charts. The songs have a lyrical atmosphere that combines both melancholy and quiet joy - particular highlights for me are 'Dive' 'Kerosene' and 'Deserters'.Although this album was released around 4 years ago (in 2000) it seems to reveal more every time it is played. It gained quite an amount of radio airplay at the time of its release (largely on the independent stations) and is widely regarded in Australia as one of the best new releases of the past few years.For American and other non-Australian listeners who want to gain a sense of the best of contemporary Australian music ignore Kylie Minogue and her ilk - try this album instead. Also definitely worth a listen is Bridie's more recent release 'Hotel Radio'. - Pallando Sydney Australia ",5.0
" Australian Rock looks to be in good shape right now with the likes of David Bridie and Powderfinger flying the flag with excellent recent albums. It's evident on first listen that Bridie's 'Act of Free Choice' sounds like nothing else out there at once urgent graceful and haunting you can expect these 11 songs to take over your mind and senses for a good while to come. The sparse beats and subtle atmospherics may find an influence in Massive Attack yet Bridie goes one further marrying these tracks to lovely unfolding melodies. Nowhere is this more evident than on 'Dive' which just envelops you in it's sheer beauty 'Kerosene' too has this power. Even the more minamilist songs have a hypnotic pull with Bridie tackling social/political as well as personal themes. It's one thing to enjoy an album another to come away from it feeling transformed and somewhat beholden from the experience. It may not be widely heard ...yet but this is essential listening. ",5.0

" SOREN AABYE KIERKEGAARD (1813-1855) 'stepped' into history as the master in managing the weapon of irony. As a young student he was fascinated by SOCRATES and the German romantic thinkers and writers. This is one of the 4 most important works of him. Some Kierkegaard lovers even call it his magnus opum. In fact this rather early work (1841) is a dissertation which in particular addresses Socratic irony (and the German romantics). The irony was to him a protest against bourgeoisie and a strong weapon against the speculative philosophy from Rene DESCARTES (1596-1650) - Kierkegaard was the first person to demask the lie of Descartes i.e. his 'cogito ergo sum' 'I think therefore I am' - up until Wilhelm Friedrich HEGEL (1770-1831).

" When this album was cut in 1956 participants Kenny Burrell Pepper Adams Tommy Flanagan and Paul Chambers were all young modern jazz players just making names for themselves on the scene; it wouldn't be long before all were considered stars. All four of them were from Detroit - thus the title(only house drummer Kenny Clarke didn't qualify in this regard). It's a very relaxed date with just about all the tunes assuming a medium groove. John Lewis's attractive AFTERNOON IN PARIS gets an excellent treatment with Flanagan's piano solo being especially fine. Tommy is also brilliant on Kenny's original blues TOM'S THUMB a tune that reverses the order of things a bit by starting out with Burrell and baritone saxist Pepper Adams exchanging 4s at the beginning rather than at the end of the tune. YOUR HOST another Burrell original is perhaps the most relaxed tune on the date with everyone producing quiet yet swinging jazz; Kenny Clarke's brushwork is particularly delicate and delightful. This is a solid mainstream-modern jazz album from the mid-50s - definitely worth looking into. ",5.0

" Listen up folks if you want to add to your music library. I know a little bit about good music but of course that's just my opinion.If any of you our there are fans of classic 70's kind of music this is a CD that is obscure but you shouldn't pass up. I looked for this album for nearly 10 years and finally found it about a year ago. It is now safely tucked away in my safety deposit box. That's how good it is to me.If you like artists like Gino Vanelli or Steely Dan you need to check this out. Roger has an absolutely stellar voice and the musicianship (sp?) on this CD are simply fantastic. These guys who the heck ever they are are fantastic musicians.My favorite tune is well you don't really care about that but trust me please try this album you won't be disappointed.Great voice fantastic lyrics touching melodies. I can't say enough good things about this album that I thought was lost to me forever. I wish he were still recording!A '10' (well '5' to Amazon) if ever there was one. ",5.0
" There is no doubt that Anthony Callea has one of the best voices of all time. This DVD was recorded after his first album was released. It has a great variety of songs including his big hits like 'The Prayer' 'Per Sempre' 'Bridge over Troubled Water' and 'Rain.' I think my favorite might be 'Wanna Be the One' which is infectious and upbeat.Though this wouldn't play on my old DVD player I had no problem playing it on my computer. Besides the concert there are five videos a making of and a behind the scenes. All in all it's one of my favorite concert DVDs ever. Now I hope my dream comes true and he duets with Leona Lewis someday. ",5.0
" This may be a 'crib' but it is possible to learn a great deal from it. It is not only about the two plays but also contains a short biography of Sartre and summaries and analyses of his major works the novel 'Nausea' and his major philosophical work 'Being and Nothingness'.It also contains a summary of the essay on 'Existensialism' one of his most influential works.It does not however as it was published in 1983 contain the latest revelations about Sartre's life and work. At the time it was written my sense is Sartre's reputation was more unimpeached than it is today. This guide stresses how much of a 'humanist' Sartre was  and how he always focused on the human situation and how deeply his writing is involved in the social problems of mankind.But Sartre's gung- ho Communist Anarchism is seen by many today as less than commendable. And his personal life shown to be far more contemptible and exploitative than was previously thought.In any case this work which rightly see Sartre more as writer than philosopher provides an excellent introduction to his overall accomplishment.

I worshiped at Greg's church years ago and have kept up with him over the years and marvel at the anointed power of his messages. When I heard this story for the first time I had no idea his life had been so difficult growing up. To see what the Lord did for this broken lost little boy is a magnificent testimony to His colossal love for us. Greg has been tested on the anvil of adversity and his story has profoundly affected my life and faith. As powerful as his ministry was before it is even more so now.

" This drawing textbook is a great deal. It has over 200 art lessons and meets the high school fine arts requirement. For the price you can't get a better deal. ",5.0
" I love to draw and have done so most of my life and yet have known so many who say 'I can't even draw a straight line'. I have found this book to be a great and simple manual to teach out of. I have personally known both adults and children who found the artist within from using the Drawing Textbook. This book gave me a way to explain some concepts simply that I didn't have the words for. To be able to do but not be able to understand HOW has been the chasm around drawing101. This book is your bridge over that chasm. It is great to teach out of but I doubt a child would want to pick up this book on his or her own to learn out of that isn't talented to begin with. The feel of it seems more mature than that.For those who can draw well this book was not made for you. It was made for beginners and those who look at drawing as something 'talented' people do. It is made for teachers like me who need words to describe things they know how to do. If you fall into one of those categories I really do not think you'll be disappointed. ",5.0

This course is part of our basic curriculum. ",5.0
" The author argues that everyone can learn to draw in a way that enables him to express his ideas in pictures just as he can learn to express ideas in words through writing. It takes no special talent and only a very tiny minority will be unable to acquire this skill.Conventional art education says that art is used solely to 'express yourself' without ever learning the basis of art - drawing. This is as silly (and frustrating and ultimately discouraging) as giving a child a violin and telling him to express himself through music. We can be taught the fundamentals of drawing just as we can be taught the fundamentals of music and while most of us will never achieve mastery or beauty we can at least achieve proficiency and have a new lifelong skill. This simple inexpensive text delivers on its promises!My 5th grade daughter and I have used this text and now can communicate readily via pictures for art math engineering (me) structural design etc. I've used these skills to renovate my master bathroom!

" David Remnick's 'King of the World' is one of my favorite books and it encouraged me to take on this meaty Pulitzer Prize winner. Remnick was on the ground as The Washington Post's Moscow bureau chief and in this work he strings together all of his exhaustive reporting for a compelling account of the collapse of the Soviet Empire.If you're running a mock U.N. at your school I'd rate 'Lenin's Tomb' as mandatory reading. ",5.0
" Reading David Remnick's unmatched work chronicalling the demise of the USSR may well have been responsible for my decision to major in Soviet History. As a professional student of the Soviet Union if I could recommend only one book on the USSR of the dozens that I have now read this would easily be me choice. It is as informative for the novice as it is challenging for the expert. If you have even the slightest interest in the demise of a world superpower and the twentieth century's most influential - and murderous - ideology you simply must read this book. ",5.0
" Despite the book's Pulitzer Prize I'm a little ambivalent about saying this in one of the best books I have read. For sure some of the best parts are that Remnick seemingly has open access to all the major Soviet political players while he was there. And he doesn't even brag about it. The titans of Soviet politics seem to be open to all who want to speak with them though Remnick's day job as the Moscow correspondent for the Washington Post certainly helped...a large part of his life in Russia then that he totally did not to write about.It's fun to follow him track down figures and weasel his way to get access to whoever he wants to talk with. He clearly is excited to be there during the transition and is personally invested in the story as he speaks Russian and both his parents and his parents-in-laws have Russian ancestry. On the other hand the book is a rag tag contemporaneous collection of personal reporting and interests lacking to some degree the broad overview that only comes with the passage of time.Doubtlessly you get the feeling of what it was like living in the Soviet Union during the Gorbachev years and the transition to Yeltsin and the end of the Communist Party....with the addition of having Remnick magically inserting himself in front of whoever he wants to talk with to fill you in on the inside story.Enjoy it.

Because it is agreatly written story about the most important event in thiscentury ",5.0
" Remnick writes eloquently and grippingly. He amazes the reader with one heartbreaking vignette after another. It seems amazing that though while only spending a few years in Russia he seemingly met everybody who was anybody and traveled to the remotest parts of the dying empire.Remnick does not try hard unfortunately to maintain objectivity. He deifies much of the intellectual dissident movement even repeatedly callling Andrei Sakharov a 'saint.' Remnick turns Gorbachev into nothing more than a well-meaning Pandora responsible for and unable to control the breakup of the Soviet Union.Remnick does show what I believe to be responsible for the breakup of the USSR- namely the rot corruption and inefficiency endemic in the Soviet system- but he seemingly relegates it to symptomatic and not primary status. The empire would have inevitably broken up with or without Perestroika and Glasnost. The book should rank despite its flaws among the best books of contemporary history ever written-doing for Russia what Democracy in America did for the US. ",5.0
" Remnick masterfully kills the Republican/Conservative myth that Ronald Reagan 'a triumph of the embalmer's art' in Gore Vidal's words led the demise of the Soviet communist empire through buying ever too many useless weapons. By showing the implosion of a very cruel very corrupt poorly managed state there can no longer be doubt about the reason for the demise of Lenin's dream. It's interesting to note that since capitalistic democracy has been introduced in Russia living standards have actually dropped (in large part because of corruption and cronyism). I definitely want to read Remnick's follow-up Resurrection to learn more about this. ",5.0
" David Remnick reported on site for the WASHINGTON POST during the Soviet Union's last days. He interviewed many persons from society's bottom to society's top from homeless derelict to Mikhail Gorbachev. That and his readable prose help explain how he won the Pulitzer. Of course it also helped that he was against totalitarianism and for humanity.When I read history I prefer a firm grip on the date. Overall this story does flow in chronological order from 1988 to 1992 or to 1994 if you get the most recent edition with its afterword. But the story jumps backward occasionally when Remnick tells the history of a character and at other moments I was vague on the date. I think chapters should have been subheaded with dates and more spots within chapters should have stated the date.Nevertheless do not let my preceding quibble deter you. I think this book is already something of a classic and I'll be darned if I'm going to give it anything less than five stars. Does another book do as well as what this book does which is put you into the scene of the collapse of the vast Soviet empire?I would have advised Mr. Remnick to include a double-paged map of the U.S.S.R. and a glossary of names events and institutions. We do get source notes bibliography index a list of interviews and twenty-two pages of relevant photos.The Vintage trade-paperback edition is over five hundred pages in small font. So be ready for something to settle back with. It will be worth a portion of the limited time you have in life. The story and the people are phenomenal and they will expand your existential horizon.

" A stupendous chronicling of history in the making! We are presented with several differing viewpoints on the collapse of the Soviet regime and its splintering in these truly tumultuous years. As the author points out whereas other empires like England took decades to recede and change - this took place within a few years. Within days sometimes overwhelming transitions took place.The efficacy of this book is the internal focus on the people in the country itself; there is none of this hyperbole on how Ronald Reagan solely dismantled the evil empire! The book is about the Soviet Union - there is little on the break-away of the Eastern Bloc countries like Poland or East Germany. Mr. Remnick presents us with a wide array of people across this vast land - from various dissidents to various neo-Stalinists. We experience their anguish as the grim and brutal history of their country becomes revealed as once secret archives are exposed.This book is well-written engaging and sprinkled with some wry humour. If you are interested in this epoch it is a truly marvellous and first-hand account. ",5.0
" The book is a compilation of short stories (each chapter a dozen pages or so) about the author's first-hand experiences in the Gorbachev's Soviet Union. From Baltic to Sakhalin and from coal miners to Gorbachev himself from Stalin to Yeltsin and from Solzhenitsyn to Sakharov the book paints the picture of the monolith's fall. This colorful collage describing the critical period in Russian history combined with keen commentary creates for the reader the distinct flavor of the time.For Russia it was the age of confusion and disillusionment. Gorbachev's half-hearted reforms (the interest in truth ended where the Party interests were concerned the pursuit of democracy gave way to the pursuit of the runaway republics etc.) were matched by the half-hearted '91 coup (no real plan no propaganda with the military Lenin wouldn't have approved).For generations Russian people did not know much of the sad history of their country and less still about the life in the West. The blissful ignorance was one thing that helped them in their miserable existence. Their various degrees of belief in the grand ideals were the other. With glasnost Gorbachev aimed at opening the gates of truth while preserving the faith. In all honesty it was impossible",5.0
" Remnick's frank insightful analysis of the Soviet Union's final days filled me with inspiration and sadness. I'm inspired by the inhuman perseverance of the Russian and Soviet bloc people and saddened by the intense and lethal persecution of millions at the hands of their so-called leaders. Remnick shows a society led by decades of fear - citizens who feared persecution and leaders who feared the loss of power. The author flows easily from dissecting the Communist party and power brokers of Soviet society to eating cabbage with Siberian miners who don't expect to live past 35 to intense discussions with the Russian intelligentsia who fought the system quietly and desperately. It is a long book and at times I found myself needing a Russian history reference guide. But Remnick is not writing a history filled with facts and statistics. It is all about the people. Lenin's Tomb should be read by any journalist who feels the urge to go beyond 8 graphs. Truly wonderful. ",5.0
" It's hard to imagine there was any dissention from the Pulitzer committee over 'Lenin's Tomb'. This book excellently combines top-notch journalism and fine precise descriptive writing for an increbidly enjoyable and informative read. Considering how most such 'good for you' books are long slogs about as exciting as bran 'Lenin's Tomb' was a surprising pleasure.I came to this book with minimal knowledge of Russia in general let alone the Soviet transition and disliking what I had encountered of Russia's culture and people. 'Lenin's Tomb' manages to explain the basics to ignorant laypeople like myself without condescending or dragging through too much history. What you need to understand what was happening Remnick provides no more and no less.'Lenin's Tomb' proved an eye opener about the Soviet experience but it also reflects on the larger ramifications of Communist autocracy. So many of the explorations of the Soviet erosion of society and culture gave me a sense of Deja Vu compared with China only China has perhaps been less scathed by the shorter span of its bureaucratic red terror. Also while 'Lenin's Tomb' did not make me like Russia or Russians any more it did present the context of how and why people can be a certain way so that I now hold it against them less.'Lenin's Tomb' is almost novelesque in its readability a page-turner and easily beach or plane fare. I doff my hat to Remnick's ability to carve dense political stuff into an involving compelling narrative. Perhaps Russia scholars would find points to criticize but from a journalistic perspective 'Lenin's Tomb' is the book all of us wish we could write. ",5.0
" Mr. Remnick has given us a masterwork. He seamlessly meshes intimate portraits of Soviet citizens within the larger landscape of the last days of the Soviet Empire. He has a rare ability to blend the micro and the macro in a soul-stirring narrative. This is a profound work that is filled with compelling stories. Lenin's Tomb is so superb that even those who avoid 'history books' will relish it. Could not more highly recommend this book. The scads of glowing reviews below are all well deserved. ",5.0
" In the Pulizer-Prize winner Lenin's Tomb David Remnick offers the reader a trip through history that is at once frightening and enthralling. Beginning with the horrors orchestrated by Lenin and continuing through the rise of Yeltsin to power Remnick intertwines political and social history with first-hand accounts which he gathered during his time in Russia during the 80s. The result is a work of unparalleled genius taking hard facts and presenting them in a personal way that makes the reader feel as if he is actually experiencing them. The end result is a chilling dose of reality for those who have idealistic notions of the world in which we live. I highly recommend this work in which Remnick portrays the brutal realities of socialist life as well as the inevitable downfall of such a system. ",5.0
" Now that we are a decade removed from the fall of the Soviet Empire it is a wonderful to look back and read a fabulous primary source about the events. Remnick the Moscow correspondant for The Washington Post during the late 80's and early 90's (and since the editor of the New Yorker which was a well deserved honor for a fabulous journalist if I may say so myself) was right on the scene when the incredible collapse of Communism took place. He interviewed hundreds if not thousands of people who had lived through the Soviet regime and who played some role regarldless of how small and seemingly insignificant in the transformation of the nation and this research paid huge dividends. He combines all these personal stories into one great book that explains and analyzes why and how this happened. It is very well written and while being comprehensive remains comprehensible. It is a wonderful book and anyone who is interested in Russia (or would like to become so) likes history in general or enjoys good semi-academic writing this book is for you. ",5.0
" Lenin's Tomb is an autopsy of sorts performed by one present during the last death throes of the Soviet Union.

" Lenin's Tomb by David Remnick chronicles the point at which the rot at the center of the Soviet system became more powerful than the Communist Party's iron fist. Remnick is a storyteller telling the story of a riveting period in history. As he writes 'To live anywhere between Bonn and Moscow in 1989 was to be witness to a year-long polical fantasy. You had the feeling you could run into history on the way to the bank or the seashore.' Lucky for us Remnick spent 1989 (as well as the years before and after) in Moscow. ",5.0

" David Remnick has given us two things",5.0
" Remnick's book is easily the most graphic and accurate account in English of the Gorbachev years between 1985 and 1991. It is unlikely to be surpassed. I judge his accuracy from his account of the August 1991 putsch which is excellent given the information that was available. As the renegade agent that triggered the June 'constitutional coup' KGB Chief Kryuchkov's August 6th decision to draft coup documents AND the August 14th decision to again start drafting the documents I have referred to Remnick in my research on the coup and the events that lead up to it. Suffice it to say that Kryuchkov's final decision on August 14th was triggered by the Bulgarian President who fired the two KGB appointees at the head of his intelligence service at my instigation. I had disclosed to him some intelligence secrets that compromised both the KGB and the British MI6 and proved that his intelligence chiefs were communist puppets which was hardly surprising since Presidents Bush and Gorbachev had agreed to leave Bulgaria in the Soviet sphere of interest at Malta in June 1989. Like a lot of people in Bulgaria I disagreed with that decision. One of the best ways of judging the accuracy of a book like Remnick's is to see how the information given in the book dovetails with the secret stuff and his book does so nicely. ",5.0
" A great fresco of the dramatic death of the communist URSS. The author lived as a correspondant in moscow for many years during the final years of the cold war and describes the tragic living conditions of the common people the corrupt style of living of the burocrats the disgusting privileges of the elites. An enclosed empire founded on corruption lies violence and misery where the dream of a better life for the masses promised by the communist leaders in the decades only became a rotten shell of deception and misery. The author interviewed hundreds of people of any social class from the miners in the urals to Mr. Gorbachev from Yeltsin to the moscow houseviwes including scientists artists poets smart people confined to the edges of the empire because of their open mindedness and acumen. This book is another important tragic witness of a wrecked dream a tale told by hundreds of different voices that all tell thesame story of treachery and indecency corruption and stupidity. A great history book that I highly recommend and that clearly helps us to understand why now Urss is governed like an authocracy by an ex kgb officer. Great book. ",5.0
" This book is a fascinating exploration of the last days of the Soviet Union providing a background of the broad mix of events and people involved both before during and after the Gorbachev era.

The watershed approach addresses environmental issues within natural hydrologically defined geographic areas taking into consideration both surface and ground water flow. Important within the watershed approach is the cumulative impact of a wide variety of human activities and the prioritization of critical issues within a given watershed. Dr. Reimold points to work in the Chesapeake Bay and the Florida Everglades as two good examples of decisions being made and focused integrated actions being taken on a 'whole drainage system' basis rather than by controlling point sources of pollution only. Water Management spans case studies in the U.S. France the Nile River basin the Pacific rim and former Soviet Union. The book contains a foreword by Dr. Eugene P. Odum. Dr. Odum professor emeritus at the University of Georgia is a recipient of the Crafoord Prize-an equivalent of the Nobel Prize-for excellence in ecology from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. It is well-annotated subject-indexed and authenticated quantitatively. Robert S. Frey M.A. Editor/Publisher BRIDGES",5.0

" I loved this book- as a neopagan it gave me insight into how much of Wicca and in turn neopaganism developed. I realize it does only focus on Wicca itself and that there were several other movements contributing to the rise of Neopaganism but the book's title states the topic so no reader should be expecting much else! On the flip side because they helped contribute Freemasons Aleister Crowley and others are covered even though they themselves were not Wiccan. Overall excellent book well-written and a must-read for any and all people even interested in Neopaganism Wicca or modern witchcraft! ",5.0

" I love the realistic damage and the crazy ways you can race in this game. The only downside is it's difficult to race multiple opponents without getting knocked off the track as is most race games where the AI is pretty aggressive.

I've even run over my driver with my own car which I've never done in any racing game before. ",5.0

You forget you have anything on your feet. They have a very cushiony sole which feels delicious to walk on - kind of airy. I'm going on a trip in October and I'm definitely taking them even though the cooler weather is here. The jewelry in the design held up beautifully - nothing fell out or came apart or needed fixing. I ordered them in a size 11 so that's a lot of shoe. The straps across the top are secured toward the back of the shoe which all but completely removes that flip flop sound. They stay on the feet are quiet and are good even in the rain because of the non-skid sole. This has been my favorite thong ever and I will definitely be ordering more from White Mtn. and Amazon!

" I love this thermometer. Don't get me wrong it is definitely an expensive purchase. However the money was well spent. My husband and I went through a considerable amount of trouble in regards to our children and trying to determine if they were truly having fevers. For a period of about 6 months our kids were having fevers ranging from a low grade to a true textbook definition of having a fever. Well we were under the impression that they were. We have made several trips to the doctor's office even switching pediatricians a few times in order to try to figure out what was going on. We were using an Exergen thermometer (which our doctor's office used)that continuously showed higher temperatures. Now I'm not knocking the thermometer in fact it's helped us during other incidents of true fevers. But based on what our pediatricians kept saying the only way to get an accurate temperature reading is with a rectal temp. Now the basic rectal thermometers that can be purchased at local pharmacies/walmart/target/etc never work for us. This Welch Allyn thermometer is accurate and considerable fast considering how long it takes to get rectal temps. So for parents who have been having difficulty finding an accurate reading of your child's temperature save yourself the stress and purchase something that will definitely match up to your standards. It's expensive but will save you money in the long run. ",5.0
" Item is exactly what I wanted and expected. I decided after purchasing several other Probe Ear and Temple Thermometers and them not work properly as well as not being accurate it was time to spend the money and use exactly what they use at the Dr.'s office.

" My health condition requires frequent monitoring of my temperature. The inexpensive thermometers were inconsistent and replacement batteries were hard to find. The Sure Temp Plus 690 costs more but is very accurate easy to use and AA batteries can be purchased anywhere. I feel confident in the readings. A back lit display would be nice but is not essential. It probably would run down the batteries faster. I would recommend the item to anyone needing fast and accurate temp readings. ",5.0

" We were left with flexible spending money at the end of the year and thus decided to make the plunge and purchase this. This thermometer is expensive but worth it.

I'm very satisfied with it so far. ",5.0
" Very sturdy. Holds up well and performs accurately for long periods even in the context of high humidity and difficult conditions in a developing world hospital. ",5.0
" I got one of these for our office. This model is a big step up from the previous model (679) that it replaced. The 679 has only 1 button from which to access all functions. The 690 has 3 buttons so you can quickly access the function that you want. It appears to be durable & accurate. Highly recommended. ",5.0
" I love having this thermometer. We have three kids and one is an infant.I got rid of my pile of cheap thermometers! I don't have to second guess the reading like I did with the cheap ones. If you have an infant you will need a rectal probe. I ended up buying that and switch them out depending on which kid we need to check. It's easy to switch out and I recommend spending the money to have that peace of mind. ",5.0

I consulted with a health practitioner who recommended the Welch Allyn Suretemp Plus 690. It works. It gives consistent temperature readings.

We just replaced the well and probe a few months ago. The casing finally cracked after all of this time. We have only had to change the batteries twice too. It is still working perfectly and we would recommend this thermometer to anyone who really needs to take temperatures often. It is so reliable. This one gets 5 stars!!!!! ",5.0
" This thermometer is great. We went through a number of less-expensive thermometers before finally finding this one. As a parent of a young child it's really important to be able to quickly and accurately take a temperature. After an unexpected hospital stay we noticed the really awesome thermometers used by the hospital staff. While this model is not quite the one from the hospital it is the exact model used by our pediatrician. We can always count on it to be fast and accurate!If you have any money left over in your annual healthcare savings account I recommend spending the money on one of these! ",5.0
" My wife has some health issues and needs to monitor her temperature regularly. We have gone through all of the cheap digital thermometers we could find I finally got sick of having the variance in readings(some were off by as much as .5 degrees!) I decided to find the best one I could get. this is it. the same one found in hospitals and doctor's offices the 690 is accurate fast and reliable. It also has a history which makes reporting to your doctor if you need to easy to do. if you only need to take your temp once in a while don't bother with this but if you even have to take it weekly I would say this is the only one to consider. make sure you get extra probe covers and replace the battery regularly but otherwise using the model could not be faster or easier.

" In rich and poetic prose Kincaid powerfully describes the life story of Xuela a woman with an alienated and barren soul who cannot love and does not want to be loved yet surprisingly is very sensual. Kincaid points to the role of motherly love and the bond to the homeland in forming the individual personality and consequently one's flow of life.My quote",5.0
" I think more readers should read this in context of Jamaica Kincaid's own personal life especially regarding her torn relationship with her mother. It would then become extremely touching as Kincaid really writes this to save her own living. While other reviewers have found this book to be harsh or dirty in some sense we should gain the sense that this narrator is really at a loss for love that there is so little to love but was able to find love in herself. ",5.0
" If you understand the culture of the Caribbean then you will certainly understand and enjoy this book. As I read it I remembered all the intresting characters from my childhood that resembled the characters in The Autobiography of My Mother. Jamica Kincaid's style is so richly descriptive it takes you 'home' again. Xuela is a very strong female character and although fate has made many of her choices for her she ultimately takes control of her own destiny. A very good read as are all her other works. ",5.0
" Autobiography of My Mother is a powerful mesmerizing and other-worldy tale of Xuela a woman of Dominica West Indies who is a worthy subject for Kincaid's musical cadences and rapturous prose. Boy can this woman write - and she infuses all her prose with the lilting voices of her compatriots. There's no way to read her work aloud without finding yourself lapsing into the patois sing-songy style of speech that comes thru so clearly in her writing. This book is a painful tale the recounting of a difficult life without much love shown to the girl as she grows from motherless infant to strong and bitter young woman who aborts her pregnancy and remains defiant the rest of her life. Raised motherless herself she determines never to mother others. Taken on a metaphorical level the woman's story could be the story of Dominica torn by suffering racism power and the unbreakable bonds that bind them together.Powerful writing on so so many levels. ",5.0
" Although her story may not leave one with a warm feeling for Dominica just reading this book made me ache for the places in her story and I see every inch of the road the mountain the sea like it was in front me. She weaves it all together into sad life and yet how can you not long to see Giraudel and Mahaut Trois Piton and all deep green of that mystical place. I read it over and over and over. ",5.0
" Jamaica Kincaid's most recent book The Autobiography of My Mother is a poetically rendered account of a woman's journey through loss longing hope and strength. Kincaid's writing here is imagistic and human so that the reader can enter the character's life. The work questions our distinctions between poetry and prose fiction and autobiography the personal and the political. This book is a sensual and intellectual pleasure ",5.0
" Wonderful book! This book synthesizes the experiences of a young woman growing up on a Carribean Island. It provides a point of view into a world few people experience or understand",5.0
" This amazing novel succeeds at its ambitious and worthy goal which in my view is to show with precision - intellectual emotional visual auditory olfactory - the sinister mechanism and the devastating results of maternal abandonment. Kincaid's narrator suffers a grievous loss and the circumstances of her life reinforce and magnify that loss. No one has ever protected her and she hangs onto life by a thread. Though amidst 'family' she is truly alone in the world. Franz Kafka wrote that one should only read novels that hurt because those are the works that raise consciousness. This straightforward and skillful novel is replete with imagery of anger sadness and layers of detail that provoke utter despair in the reader - and that's just Kincaid's point. Kafka would have approved of this gripping story. ",5.0
" I think this is the general consensus from the reviews gathered here but I will add my voice to the chorus so to speak. This book is haunting. This is not one of those books that you forget about as soon as you've finished reading the last page. I've personally never been to the Caribbean and I do not think I will ever be able to personally visit Rousseau for instance but Kincaid's literary ability to make the descriptions jump off the page is something to be admired. there is a caveat to all of this of course. This book is not for the faint of heart. There are portions of this novel that are quite graphic and that is putting it lightly. That is not to say that it distracts from the work itself merely that it is there and certain sensitive readers may take affront to it. This is a rich text that can withstand multiple readings because you find something new every time. I came to this novel after reading. In a previous work ' A Small Place' and gratefully on my part the author was redeemed in my esteem. Not that I'm someone of any great import but I had completely sworn off the author as someone I could never enjoy. this book is really hard to describe beyond the utter basics to someone who has never read it. in order to do so I would need to commit a great disservice to the book and the author. There are elements of biography and autobiography as well as magic realism and what could possibly be construed as a cultural critique of the West. It is not necessary to see each and every one of these threads to enjoy the book I merely use this as a way to comment that the author certainly has an intellectual project in mind.of course this review is not an introduction to English. sufficed to say this book is worth your time.

" Those familiar with the dearly departed Miracle Legion (poster boys for the 'Should Have Been A Household Name Foundation') and the under-rated Upstate New York Americana-rockers Subduing Mara will find this little release to be a pleasant surprise. Sparse intimate and demo-ish (in the best of all possible ways) Mara frontman Peter Hutchison and the Legion's legendary Mr. Ray have combined efforts to create a casual and intimate folk-rock gem. Difficult to catagorize this short-but-sweet offering is reminiscent of everything from David Gray to Supertramp to 'Me & Mr. Ray' era Miracle Legion. Although the disc credits Hutchison with the songwriting Mr. Ray's Legion-flavored 6-string sonic stamp is readily apparent throughout. Despite the fact that it's a far from perfect disc ('Promise' for instance sounds like an exercise in 'we better put a pop song somewhere on this thing') 'exquisite corpse' has a distinctly unique character and is both beatific and quirky in turn. Unfortunately for Lucas Shine this record defies being shoved into any convenient little boxes for the sake of marketing. Fortunately for the rest of us however there are people still out there making this kind of music... hopefully we'll hear more from these folks down the line. ",5.0
" This disc contains Ornette Coleman's pioneering 37-minute 'Free Jazz' PLUS 40 minutes of shorter pieces recorded in the same year. So for a little less money than the American release of 'Free Jazz' you get about twice as much music and the title track is the final piece a fitting climax to a great set of music. That said the jazz on this disc may be more challenging than some listeners would like but among the extended collective improvisations of the sixties besides being the first this one is more immediately accessible because it SWINGS and it COOKS! And you can tell the musicians are actively listening to each other and responding to each other's work not just showing off or venting their emotions. So in a nutshell 'Free Jazz' is less cosmic than Sun Ra's 'Magic City' less cerebral than Cecil Taylor and less primal than Coltrane's 'Ascension' but probably more likely to hook you into an intensely brilliant musical world.

" This book is a paradox. It is written in a casual conversational style yet it contains very scholarly information. Ostensibly aimed at a young adult or even younger audience it appeals just as well to adults. The main text runs about 105 pages with an appendix. It gives detailed information on the arms armor and fighting style of the Germanic peoples that overran the Roman empire in Western Europe from around 400-800 A.D. It is the little details that really appealed to me such as how the sword hilts were constructed different makers marks on blades and centers of manufacture. The excellent illustrations by the author compliment the text nicely as well. The author ended this study around 800 A.D. because that is when new metalworking technology changed the types of swords being made thus beginning a new era in weaponry and swords in particular. I will definitely be reading more books by this author. ",5.0

" I started taking Vitex after reading about it on many fertility sites. My husband and I have been trying to conceive for over 6 months and are trying everything to make it happen before he deploys. I have always had irregular periods- even my first one was. I had been on birth control mainly to regulate my periods before meeting my husband and then afterwards to prevent pregnancy. I was having two periods a month or one every 45 days- just all over the map. Since coming off of birth control 7 months ago my cycles would vary in length between 25 and 35 days. It was driving me crazy having to wonder for weeks at a time if I was just 'late' again or if I was pregnant. Then when the cycles were shorter my luetal phase was not long enough to carry out implantation thsu preventing pregnancy. So I ordered Vitex. I have had a regular 27 day cycle for four months now. I can even pinpoint the exact day I will start my period which has NEVER happened. I will be taking this from now on instead of birth control (after a pregnancy- hopefully!) to regulate my cycles. I highly reccomend it. ",5.0
" I have been reading about vitex for a year or so. I tried using another brand of vitex and I would feel very weird (dizzy light-headed super heavy flow)...I guess it was because the levels of vitex varied with each capsule....so I was never able to get the correct dosage. So after reading the reviews for the Solaray Vitex I decided to give it one more shot. I highly recommend THIS brand of Vitex because the ingredients are standardized...meaning you are guaranteed get the same potency with every capsule.I have been seeing my doctor for two years now to correct my infertility problems. He told me that I was not able to ovulate on my own. I would have to take drugs. I wanted to try a more natural way first. Last month I wasn't taking vitex....and I did not ovulate. This month i am pleased to say that I have a positive on my ovulation stick! I was so happy that I took a picture of it to show my doctor!! It is definitely working for me.

On a side note about two years ago I bought some Vitex for PMS and it didn't seem to work. Later I found out from reading that it's the Vitex Extract that is supposed to be more effective for these feminine problems and what I had purchased before was just Vitex Fruit. I'm not sure whether or not the Solaray Vitex Extract I'm taking now is helping my PMS crabbiness but I think it is helping with my bloating. ",5.0

" I spent a lot of time researching natural remedies to help with fertility. My husband and I had been trying for 2 years and no success. I am 36 years old with no children and it started getting frustrating. I had 100% normal periods 28 days exactly every month. I had read some reviews that said do not take Vitex if you have normal periods. I also get migraines. BAD migraines usually the exact day before my period.Because of this economy my husband moved out of state to look for work and so we have been seperated for the past 9 months. We timed out visits with eachother around ovulation. Still no luck. In May 2010 I started taking vitex. My first period happened as normal as usual but this time no migraine! In July I planned a visit up north to visit my husband. Upon returning to Florida I discovered I was pregnant! This after 2 months of taking Vitex!SO I am a believer in this! I'm sure there may have been other factors involved the food is much fresher and healthier up north and we were just haning out having a good time no stress. If nothing else if you get hormone related migraines I would try Vitex. I have had migraines for many years so bad I have been in the hospital for them and I have a high pain threshold! Still have a long way to go and I am considered 'high risk' because of my age but an thrilled with Vitex! Highly recommended even with regular periods. ",5.0
" This works! It is AMAZING! It helps your body to produce progesterone. You don't need to take progesterone if you take this. It made a huge difference with my emotional symptoms before my period. I am like a new person! And it helped with spotting that I was having from not having enough progesterone. I didn't have to take the risky progesterone my doctor wanted me to take- I cured myself with this. Make sure that you take the Vitex that is the extract with .5% Agnuside (this one). Don't take the one that is just Chaste Tree fruit. It does nothing and it's a shame that they make it because people might try it and think that Vitex doesn't work. I want every woman who is suffering needlessly to discover Vitex because it helped me SO much! ",5.0

" I have always had a normal menstral cycle until about a year ago when I stopped getting my period.

I read in a book that Chaste Berry Extract could make that possible. It said it could take a few months but I thought I would give it a try. I have been taking it (one pill a day) for months now and for the first few months the change was minimal but I could tell a little bit of a difference. Now it seems to be working it is a lot more regulated than it was. I've only had to take the Provera one time during the first few months of taking this extract. Hopefully soon I won't need the Provera at all! I will continue to take this product for a long while. If you are having the same problem as me I STRONGLY recommend this!

" This is the most awesome product ever! I used to have regular periods till I hit my late 20's then my system started going crazy. I'd miss a period then get one the following month. Then I went for 3 months without...hence a trip to the dr and left with a prescription for Provera. I started researching Provera and only found bad stuff about it being synthetic... my search lead me to Vitex and since its natural I thought it's worth a try. I took one pill a day and the following month my period was right on schedule...and each month since!! I think it works wonderfully.Before writing this review I read the others and noticed one lady writing about the decreased migraines. I used to suffer from migraines at least once a week and they were bad & horrible. Bad enough to make a trip to the ER sometimes as I was sure something much more was wrong...they were that intense! I noticed in the last past few months that I've had less migraines and they were less intense some that I could skip taking a pill. Upon reading the other ladies reviews I'm now confident it was Vitex regularing out the hormones that were causing the migraines. I too found that I'm less irritable and moody.I want to call Vitex the magic 'lady fix'. ",5.0
" When I found this product for my daughter she was 20 years old and just diagnosed with PCOS. She had moderate beard growth very overweight and extremely painful periods. After having a CAT scan done that diagnosed PCOS (they found cysts on her ovaries) and a blood test that showed an extremely high testosterone level (way above the normal range) I was quite alarmed when the doctor told us that he wanted to put her on Yaz birth control pills and spironolactone a potassium-sparing diuretic (it acts as an anti-androgen but then you have to monitor your potassium intake). I didn't want my daughter on these powerful drugs that both can have dangerous side effects (strokes for Yaz cancer for spironolactone). So I decided to research a natural supplement that she could try first before resorting to the prescription medications. I found Vitex Chaste Berry Extract and I started giving my daughter two capsules per day. There have been no side effects from taking this product. My daughter went back to the endocrinologist 6 months later for another blood test. I admitted to the doctor that my daughter had not taken the meds he had prescribed - that we had tried her on Vitex for the past 6 months. I promised him that if the blood test showed no improvement in her testosterone level we would start her on the meds. Lo and behold when the results of the blood test came back my daughter's testosterone level was reduced to one-half of the previous level--and it is back in the middle of the normal range!! I was thrilled! This is a great product and I highly recommend it for lowering testosterone levels in a female. ",5.0

" From the charming opening sequence of memories from Rosemary and L. Sprague de Camp to the interesting list of Heinlein's 'Unwritten Works' this volume provides a fascinating insider's look at Robert Heinlein's life and work.It purports to cover every one of Heinlein's published works ... short stories novellas and novels all ... and I believe that claim. If it is missing anything I would be unable to name it. The book generally assumes that the reader is a Heinlein fan and has read all or most of his work. You won't find much in the way of plot summaries here. What you will find is information about various drafts of novels where information is available and for these it is interesting to see how an original concept was molded into published form.There are some notes and tidbits about every work often including information about Heinlein's inspiration for the work as a whole or for elements used here and there in the story. Other pieces of trivia are liberally mixed in.Oddly the author makes a number of mistakes when trying to enumerate various plot ideas. For example when listing Heinlein works which use time travel as a device he forgets 'Farnham's Freehold'. In listing books that use the surface of Venus as a location he forgets 'Space Cadets.' However I can forgive these oversights. If nothing else it gives the reader a chance to 'participate' by knowing that you remember something about Heinlein's work that this researcher overlooked or forgot. ;-)If you haven't read at least most of Heinlein's novels and many of his short works then this book probably isn't for you. You'd be completely lost in not knowing the context of the discussion for most of the works. Without an abiding love of Heinlein's fiction much of this could be deadly dry.For someone like me who literally grew up reading Heinlein (I read 'The Star Beast' during the first month of 4th grade when I was nine years old and I'm pretty sure that was the first sci-fi I'd ever read) this book is a treasure and I wish I had happened across it long ago. I don't agree with every conclusion drawn by the author but there are many things about Heinlein's writing that even two die hard fans will disagree about.If you haven't read a lot of Heinlein the information in this book is not of the type to often inform you or inspire you to read particular Heinlein works. For folks like me who have devoured his every word often many times each page contains interesting information.Highly recommended for every Heinlein fan. ",5.0

Instead of a dramatic presentation it's a deep exploration of choices and alternatives and risks that such a mission would face.

" The amazon.com reviewer hits it right on the nose regarding this set. Stravinsky was not a conductor at the start of his career but began to conduct his own works in public in the 1920s when he was in his mid-forties doubtless in part because he needed the income. Some of his earliest recordings are not entirely successful (at least in my opinion) but by the time he made the ones in this set in the early 1950s he was truly expert in getting his players to produce what he had in mind as much as any composer/conductor I can think of. Sometimes his recordings feature studio or pickup groups that are not quite on par with the top orchestras but they often are and his performances are always well worth hearing.Amazon's reviewer mentions the splendid Histoire and Octet. Stravinsky did stereo versions in 1961 though the stereo Histoire features Los Angeles musicians including violinist Israel Baker rather than the New York-based musicians in this 1954 version which includes violinist Alexander Schneider. All of these are excellent but the Histoire and Octet here in excellent mono sound get my vote as more dramatic and exciting overall.The original LP of the Histoire and Octet is a rare collector's item (the excellent notes to this set by Tim Page actually mention this) and the CD sound is superior to that of the original LPs so it's great to see this set at a low price again. Grab it quickly before only the expensive ones are left. ",5.0

" Having gotten tired of passing by my bathroom only to hear the vent fan roaring away from having been on no telling how long I looked around and found this simple one-to-one swap for my existing switch. Design-wise it is a spring loaded timer that can be set for anywhere from about 2 to 15 minutes. Setting it causes the fan to come on and then the timer simply winds down to cut the fan off after the set amount of time. The unit comes in either white or beige (which for some reason costs more on Amazon). The installation package includes screws for the power connection screws for the switch plate a plastic knob and a small plastic plate with timer markings and retainer nut. The timer plate is flanged to fit a traditional switch plate and is sized to fit into a decora styled plate. By the same token the unit has screw points for either style. In my estimation the thought that went into the design makes this a 5-star product. Obviously it does require an electrical installation and if you don't have the confidence to replace a wall switch by all means call an electrician or a more confident friend to do the work.If you are doing the install here's some info that might be useful. The unit's connection points are clearly marked as 'line' (for the input power 'hot' wire) and 'load' (for the appliance it is being connected to in my case a fan). It's usually pretty easy to determine which cable is bringing power into the junction box and normally the black wire for the cable is hot (that being said it's always best to check using a volt meter between what you think is hot and the ground wire - you obviously should drop power to the box before proceeding to installation). The timer may work if hooked up in reverse but I assume there is a reason the manufacturer has designated which connection is to be hot. The connection mechanism uses a screw with an integrated wire clamp to hold an inserted wire easy to do if you have plenty of wire to work with. In my case I didn't have long enough wires in the junction box to make this kind of connection so I first attached a pig tail wire to each connection point. For the actual install I attached each pig tail to the line and load wires in the junction box using wire nuts. Just a thought but that may well be an easier approach even if you have plenty of wire to work with. ",5.0

I was hoping that there was a more attractive alternative and the FD15MWC switch was exactly what I was looking for. So I replaced the old FF15MC with a FD15MWC and my new timer switch fits in beautifully with the two adjacent light switches and has performed flawlessly.

" Firstly let me tell you that if you are an elite critic and watched this movie ask yourself why. Do you even like the action-movie genre? No? Then don't waste our time by writing reviews about stuff you don't enjoy. We like it here and we like Hollywood. So astalavistababy.For all WWE Fans and those who have come to see John Cena blow things up by more than just his fist - this is an awesome action flick. I too came to see this movie because I am a fan of WWF now known as WWE and because I admire John Cena as a person and not just as what we see him do inside the squared ring.The first 5 to 10 minutes of the movie needs to be passed over. To be forgiven. It is not the best start to an action movie. And this is an out and out thriller of an action movie. But then Robert Patrick shows up and everything rocks and everything is cool again. Yes I came to see Cena and got bowled over by Robert Patrick. Patrick carries this movie. I would say he saved the movie. Cena is great. He is our hero. And we cheer for him throughout the movie as he gets beat while trying to rescue his dear wife. But you can't help fall for Robert Patrick. He waltzes in all bad-a$$ and mean. He is ultra uber-cool. He makes the badguy role come alive and give meaning to the whole story. As in any story for the hero to be a hero you need a strong adversary. We get that in the form of a team of criminals led by Robert Patrick.The action is non-stop. As soon as the villain has done his first job in the movie - the action keeps up the tempo and we get big gunfights and bigger explosions. The crazy black dude routine is well played here by a henchman of Patrick. I was a bit disappointed with the truth behind the 'rock candy story' - they should have made it as big as it sounded. But there is plenty of more fun in the movie. Some dark humour and Cena is incredible as he chases down the bad guys in the mandatory car chase sequence and then on in the swamps. This is thrilling from there till the very end. Some good hand-to-hand fights. Cena gets punished and he triumphs. The deviation with the 2 other crooks in the same swamp thinking Cena is a cop looking for them is also brilliant turn of events. More action. More a$$-kicking. The scenes with the explosion are very well shot.The two big ones with Cena at the petrol pump explosion and him at the shack in the swamp exploding are incredibly well captured. You could feel Cena getting the fury of the fire. Awesome stuff. And Patrick is unstoppable too. He is determined and he has the wife as a leverage and hostage. There is the essential bad girl accompanying the villain Patrick. She does a great job better I think than the actress who plays Cena's wife. In all I would rate high the casting as the team of Patrick is well picked bunch of actors doing what they do best. These bad guys are worth cheering for.Cena of course makes it to the climax. An epic one it is involving a truck a motorboat explosions fistfights splattering of blood and the suspense of whether Cena's wife will survive this ordeal or not.Watch this one and make sure you reload the popcorn.

" The Marine DVDIt's interesting to see Vince McMahan and the WWE going into another form of 'scripted entertainment' i.e. diversifying. Smart business move.This is in fact a terrific action/adventure movie in the mold of the Rambo or Schwarzenegger films (e.g. 'Commando') or the Indiana Jones series. The violence is not accurate in depiction of results but neither is it in any movie where female stars takes full-power strikes and come bouncing back. If reality counted in the movies there would be no girl-star action movies.The violence is actually toned down in favor of action. For example Sgt. Triton chooses to takes out two very tough villains in exciting brawls when he has a good fighting knife with him. Reality would have been different .... and much bloodier. Not much gore or blood in this picture however and you can safely take your pre-teen or teen son. Or yourself. My wife liked it too for that matter.Don't be surprised to see the knife on the market soon ala Rambo.The acting was top-drawer within the context of the plot. I never heard of John Cenaso I can't be considered biased. Triton was seen first in front of his commanding officer then interacting with his wife. He was supposed to be emotionally restrained with his commander and strong but a little reflective with his wife. He was. Then The Marine had a mission. He had to complete it not emote and burst into tears. After the adrenalin high wore off he'd probably start shaking but while things were going on he didn't have time to be upset. Man haven't the sweetie-boys who have panned his acting ever been in a fight? I never heard of the starbut he turned in a very believable good performance for the part. The excellent-looking wife did a fine job as well. No nudity in this movie. Unfortunately.In sum a fine example of its type and highly recommended for all. It requires some suspension of belief but most action movies do.Recommended for fans of John Cena the WWE and Arnold and Rambo for that matter.GunnerGunner December 2007 ",5.0
" The Marine is quite a phenomenal action film! The amounts of insanely addicting and devastating-looking action scenes are overwhelming. The film stars WWE wrestler John Cena in search of his wife who was kidnapped by a bunch of guys who weren't afraid to die or kill anyone who unfortunately happened to get in their way.Anyone who enjoys action films with lots of hand fighting and lots of shooting (and I mean LOTS of these things) you will definitely find yourself enjoying the Marine. It's nothing but total nonstop action for the last hour or so. The movie clocks in at 1 hour and 23 minutes (even though some other places have said the time length was a bit longer it's actually not). The negative reviews are really strange to me- John Cena himself promoted the movie as nothing but an action film. It doesn't pretend to be anything else. It's just lots and lots of ACTION!My favorite moments were the exploding gas station and the bad guys shooting Cena's car WHILE it was flipping around in the air! These are truly some of the greatest action scenes a movie could ask for. Anything better than this would be impossible! ",5.0

" O.K. The basic plot -- cop forced by vengeful ex-con through a series of timed challenges -- isn't unique . But the story has unexpected twists and turns and uses the city of New Orleans to its advantage. John Cena does a great job and I would be willing to watch any of the other actors again. The story is violent -- explosions are the threat the movie begins with -- and there are maybe two mild profanities in the general release version. But if you snack while you watch your movies beware. Get the snacks beforehand because you can't miss a minute of this fast paced thriller. ",5.0
" I thought this movie was incredibly entertaining and filled to the brim with action suspense explosions and comedy. John Cena stars as a Marine named John Triton who is being honorably discharged for disobeying a direct order. When he returns home he decides to go on vacation with his wife Kate. While at a gas station Kate is kidnapped by a jewel thief named Rome and his associates. John goes on a 1-man rampage in order to get her back. Throughout the day Rome and his group try to kill John but he's too stubborn to die. If you love action I highly recommend THE MARINE!!! ",5.0

" This is undoubtedly the best cure for a boring sunday afternoon. Our hero (John Cena ) is poised to pick up the mantle of America's next Hero / Champion. The man can take a full force blast to to his cranium with Thor's Hammer and resucitate after a minute; feeling invigorated enough to resume his Crusade. The wunnerful Robert Patrick (Terminator II) is his challenging nemisis and does not dissapoint.Now THE ACTION sequences of this movie is what is worth the price of admission. From frame one the pyrotechnics/asskicking is WHIZ BANG. The dialogue provides some fine comedic relief ' MAN BROTHERS JUST DON'T DRIVE MINI-VANS YA DIG? ' (the pimp).Cars disintergrate bombs blow bullets buzz fires blaze no time to bleed complete the mission! This BLU-RAY izda bomb! Grandson pass the popcorn. ",5.0
" 'The Marine' was pretty much a bomb when it was released in 2006; fans and critics alike hated the movie but if you have a fondness for action films and if you are a huge fan of wrestler John Cena purchase the DVD. I bought the movie purely because I like looking at Cena not because I think he can act. There is a lot of male testosterone available but both the script and performances are flawed. The plot deals with a marine who discovers his wife has been kidnapped by an evil demented villin and it's up to this marine to track down his wife's captor and make him pay. TV's 'Nip/Tuck's' Kelly Carlson plays the wife and Robert Patrick is an OK villin but it's Cena'a perfomance and presence that make the film. I am sure with the write script Cena could be a huge movie star; he has amazing screen presence with the looks and body that most actors would die for.The DVD comes with many bonuses including both the theatrical and unrated versions the featurette called 'The Making of The Marine' WWE Promotional Features John Cena Featurettes and more.

" This movie was the debut of wrestler John Cena. He is the many timedheavyweight champion of the WWE. He has proven to be entertaining as a wrestler. In this movie he saves the lives of some fellow marines in Iraq from some al-Quaidi terrorists. He is discharged for disobeying orders.He and his lovely wife Kate whos is played by Kelly Carlson decide totake a trip into the mountains. On their trip they drive into an altercation involving some dangerous jewel theives. His wife Kate is snatched and taken hostage. These jewel theives are led by a viciousvillain played by Robert Patrick. He truly comes off as being evil. Thiskidnapping results in some nonstop action. Triton gets involved in high speed chases and many hand to hand situations. Triton even encounters crooked policemen. There are even explosions all during the chase scenes.Cena and John Patrick have a battle to the death to end the movie. Thereis also an exciting rescue scene. All in all this was a very entertaining movie. ",5.0

I don't see the differance is between the unrated version and the rated version but it still a great action experience.I think John Cena should stick to being an action star besides wresling because fans would want to see him in future actions movies as a tough man.

" I first read 'Create a Life....' about a year ago at a time when I had been phased out of a job I thought I loved my mother died and a friend was suffering from depression. I was angry stressed and burnt out. As a sort of one year anniversary gift to myself I have just re-read the book. It is concise. The writing is clear and crisp and the ideas are beautifully supported with everyday examples. Among the most meaningful tidbits for me are the three words 'You are enough.' For most of my life the more I accomplished the harder I pushed. I was rewarded with bonuses and kudos and still felt the need to compete. Finally I gave myself permission to get off the merry go round and pursue other interests. And as Zoglio advises I let go of anger and resentment and began to take care of myself. I now choose what I do. I have time for volunteering and time for me. This is a book of simple truths... if you want love and abundance in your life give it away. If you believe in something believe in it all the way. Choose how you use each day of your life. The pages are filled with passion. My best advise after the reading the book a second time is buy one for a friend. ",5.0

Until I read Tickle I never really thought in terms of a second phase of life the way the author presents it (the best one!). I enjoyed Dr. Zoglio's approach to 'reinventing your life' as she takes you through a touching thought provoking empowering process where you will among other things let go of old baggage move out of your comfort zone dream find your purpose and take action. I found the exercises to be fun and easy and they left me feeling enlightened energized and focused.Tickle is loaded with practical wisdom so I suggest a highlighter.

It gives you positive steps to take control of your life. I especially liked the section on dreams. So many people put down the notion that we should have dreams for our life. We should dream and dream big. It's very easy to read and flows easily from chapter to chapter.

" Circa WWII - back in the days when some of our allies were not much better than the enemies we were fighting something happened at Katyn that provides some rather considerable insight on the ways and targets of tyranny. Wipe out the intelligentsia. As in the formative days of America the intelligentsia can be a powerful force for liberty - even counter revolution. When tyrannical change becomes fast and revolutionary the opposition must be wiped out in a single stroke if possible - as at Katyn. The Russians tried to blame it on the Germans and largely succeeded in a day when America was to say the least much more pro-Russia than it was pro-German.The slow revolution presently taking place in America has succeeded in wiping out the intelligentsia in a different not to say more 'moderate' way - death by media - death by the arts - death by academia. Either way truth and liberty end up lying in the streets. Ultimately tyranny is a war against the truth. Perhaps you've noticed there's not much of it around lately.

Lauren has tried to move on but has not had closure on the tragedy so decides it is time to head to the South American country to learn what caused her mother who seemed to have it all to suddenly kill herself.In Peru Lauren nearly dies in what seems like a questionable accident. Only the quick action of local psychiatrist Dr. Armando Torres saves her life. He tells her she should go home as it is not safe for her here. She wonders whether he wants her to leave for his own reasons as she demands he tell her what he knows about her mother's death as he was there when she took her life.NOT WITHOUT THE TRUTH is a fast-paced romantic suspense tale that starts at hyperspeed when Laurena arrives in South America and never slows down until the final altercation. Lauren is a terrific center holding the plot together with her need to know which in turn provides some insight into her mother (at least from her memories). Armando in some ways is the more interesting character as the audience wonders what was his relationship with the mother including how involved was he on the night of the accident.

" I doubt I shall ever come across a better writer of history or Science Fiction in this lifetime.Asimov was a great student of history psychology and science. Unlike most students and academics though Asimov also was a superb writer in each area and could distill the essence of his knowledge into entertaining non-fiction or fiction. Read his books regarding history of civilization or about Black Holes or about religion and I'm sure you will appreciate his knowledge about such diverse topics and his ability to keep you awake at night reading!I'm not saying you will agree with his every point - only that you will be exposed to a well-articulated discussion.In the Foundation series it is clear Asimov has combined history and psychology to an extraordinary degree. The question is was this young man of Russian birth writing of Russia's future or was he merely writing of England's past?You see a great civilization has encompassed all the known world. Then inevitably it will begin a collapse. As in other empires collapse begins in part due to the burdensome administrative hub (Moscow Washington DC or London?) combined with a recession at a time when the outcast and downtrodden are fed up with unemployment and unfulfilled promises of a better future (Eastern Europe or the inner cities of America or Britain). This dilemma is further exacerbated by revolutionaries and terrorists in the hinterlands.Enter Mr. Seldon. Clearly he is based on the alter ego of Asimov himself for the man is a student of mathematics psychology religion and history as well as of politics.I could write a book to dissect the brilliance of the writing and the lessons for all leaders but will simply say that Foundation Foundation & Empire and Second Foundation make up my favorite all-time trilogy. No knock against Lord of the Rings intended. LOTR is terrific but not quite as good. ",5.0

" This book is amazing. After waiting all these years to jump onto the Asimov train I am glad that I am finally here; the book is thoughtful smart and paced wonderfully.

" The first book of Asimov's classic Foundation Trilogy. It is a must-read for any true fan of science fiction. Like other great works of the genre it has held up over time and is one of those books that you'll find yourself going back to read again and again. I highly recommend it. Be sure to also check out the other two books of the Foundation Trilogy 'Foundation and Empire' and 'Second Foundation'. ",5.0
" Here in the second installment of Azimov's fantastic Foundation epic you have a continuation from the first that at first seems a let down. Then the Mule shows up and the action really gets going.The first part is about the General and the reason I say it's a letdown is that what you think is going to happen and hope for the sake of action is going to happen doesn't. It's important that it doens't and makes a good point.The Mule however is where the meat is as others have stipulated. He's a monkey wrench in the whole plan Hari Seldon put together to save humanity during the 'Dark Ages' after the collapse of the Galactic Empire. Well written and a definite must for any who claim to love sci-fi. ",5.0
" I first read Foundation as a bored teen with no idea what it was about. Foundation is a book which demands to be read quickly and thus the impression amidst the brilliant storyline is often shallow.I read it this time in a couple of hours; I would've read it quicker without work and cafes and other impediments but basically I devoured it. And because it read so fast the impressions of the individual stories flickered past too.The sense of history as pattern is stronger in this book than any single narrative. Having read the brilliant new Foundation trilogy written by the three Bs (Brin Benson and Bear) which tells the personal life story of Hari Seldon the very brief treatment of Seldon in the first trilogy is more notable for what is unsaid. Hari is just another name in history for Asimov; the hero is the idea even the fast-flow of the narrative of itself might be called the Hero because the whole notion of story here is webbed against historical patterns so closely.Briefly then Foundation has the setup and three payoffs. The setup is Hari Seldon arranging exile to Terminus.Salvor Hardin's politicization of Terminus is the first payoff and is especially brilliantly written.Smyrnian Trader Limmar Ponyet's chicanery on planet Askone's closed market demonstrates the limits of religion and is the second payoff.Then Hober Mallow's power grab and abandonment of religion for trade as a means for influence in the third.The story starts and ends with court cases first against Hari Seldon and last against Hober Mallow. The ideology of the book is anti-violence and pro social and economic measures. In fact it may be the first really positive exploration of what has come to be called 'soft power' of which the European Union is the present example.The great touches of image serve to cast a deeper shadow on the role of public morality in sustaining a civilisation. For instance the ambassador from Anacreon presents the hilt of his gun as a symbol of peaceful intentions when he visits Salvor Hardin on Terminus.In the context of history the book is extraordinarily complex and sophisticated. Social and economic complexity is reduced and strained free of dense matter and difficulty like consomme soup made to be thin yet delicious and easily consumed. The very first thought I had at the end of reading Foundation was 'how I wish there were a history of Rome so readable and fast and easy to consume!'Normally I read Foundation in a great hurry (as I have this time) in combination with the other two books Foundation and Empire and Second Foundation. But I only have a copy of the first book of the trilogy and must make do with it.The first payoff is quite brilliant because it is delayed and played out indirectly thus deflecting the thrill of emotional rush into intellectual wonder. Specifically Salvon Hardin delays the confrontation between Terminus and Anacreon for thirty years years which Asimov summarizes in a bitter and brilliant battle of words between the old Hardin and young Sek Sermak. Thus the reader feels that the payoff is deferred. The reader senses an even bigger payoff at the far end of the section 'Mayors'. And Asimov does not fail us. For Salvor Hardin travels to Anacreon to personally entrap the evil regent there and defeat him - again inevitably with soft power. Hardin defeats his enemy on the enemy's territory at the precise moment when it seems all is lost for the Foundation.One is left with the distinct impression that brains defeat brawn skilled inaction and insight defeat busyness and boldness and that the power of wisdom and foresight overcomes even a social collapse on the scale of the fall of the Roman Empire - as indeed they did. For the Fall of Rome resulted in the rise of Christendom and with it a grand tradition - so Asimov's message by locating a historical European lesson in the distant future - becomes a timeless affirmation of human excellence.Foundation thus stands virtually alone in the field of science fiction novels in excellence.

" You've already read the publisher's summary for yourself so let me just add that this is THE classic SF trilogy. Book one 'Foundation' creates the future world its declining culture and how a group of strong-minded individuals don't want to see knowledge die. How they do that drives this novel. In book two Asimov introduces the mystery of the mule and in book three Asimov pulls a rabbit out the hat called the Second Foundation.If you enjoy books that entertain books that offer good mysteries and books that make you think about bigger things in life than this series is for you. It's too bad our political leaders don't read novels like this. Maybe we'd avoid the continual messes they get countries in. ",5.0
" Asimov is a must read for any science fiction reader. Even though the writing style leaves something to be desired the pure imagination of his writing is something memorable. It's hard to imagine Star Wars or any other sci-fi without this book. Asimov barrels through time and the universe passing through hundreds of years in the turn of a page in a way that is rich and convincing. He builds many worlds characters and ties it all together through Hari Seldon and his psychohistory (a previously worked out map of human reactions and thus events for generations to come) and the Mule (a mutant who throws a wrench in the plan and--like most bad guys or in this case mutants--seeks world domination). What's incredible about this villian is his strange depth which the reader gets completely secondhand. The book goes on and on with one beautiful idea after another. For example a strange jester/clown character Magnifico that the heroes--Bayta and Torie--pick up plays an instrument called the sono-visor. This instrument harnasses the alpha waves of the brain and mixes melody with image in each listener. Now how's that for cool? Asimov wows the reader again and again with clearly explained inventive ideas. This book is the first of a trilogy. A must read for anyone with an interest in literature or science-fiction. ",5.0
" The Foundation Trilogy is timeless. Asimov is the master. No wonder it won a Hugo for best all-time series.It's the fall of the Galactic Empire and the rise of the Foundation guided by psychohistory (a scientific method of predicting the future) developed by the Foundation's founder Hari Seldon.Classic Sci Fi! ",5.0
" This book sets the stage for the rest of the series. Hari Seldon is introduced and his theories of Psychohistory are explained. Then Seldon's Foundation is established on Terminus a remote planet at the edge of the Empire with the goal of shortening the period of barbarism the universe will experience. However there are no Psychohistorians located in the Foundation... only scientists. The planet has very few native metals and virtually no defenses. The scientists must figure out how to rule their world and fend off avaricious neighbors as the Empire begins to crumble. The majority of this first volume contains vignettes chronicling the Foundation leaders responding to various crises that Hari Seldon predicted centuries before. The crises are varied and plausible. The solutions to the problems that arise are not solved by any miraculous means but by tough clever political maneuvering. Watching the crises and their solutions unfold is very enthralling and keeps you turning the pages at a rapid pace. ",5.0
" This book was recommended to me for a writing exercise and I was surprised to find that I enjoyed it as much as I learned from it. I had lumped Asimov in with Clarke as a boring SF writer and I was quite wrong. This book also works amazing magic with the passage of time and circumstance and despite how quickly characters drop out of the landscape of the novel the reader remains interested. A masterful work from one of the great masters.If you don't know much about SF this is a good book for you; if you are a SF fan who thinks Asimov has nothing to offer you this is a great book for you. Pick it up. ",5.0
" People like to throw five star reviews at just about anything. I suppose they feel that almost everything written is as good as it gets. Foundation is one that deserves all five stars.It's a classic. The premise is intriguing. The story unwinds brilliantly over three books. Don't expect to read The Foundation alone. It does leave you hanging. The next two books in the trilogy are a must.This is one of a handful of solid enduring works that will be enjoyed long after other works fade off the lists... ",5.0
" Ah Foundation this is perhaps one of the best and highly original works of Dr. Asimov. I was impressed that a man of only 20 could come up with such a creative vision of the future it was not only the very distant future but one aside from most of the common stereotypes. This books plot line was excellent he sounded like he really knew what he wanted from the get go and not make it up as he went along. If i had to change a thing it would be; i would like to see some of these characters come to a complete close I'm not saying that i would like to put a stop to the big gaps through time but make the characters have a little more closure.I think that you will get a lot out of this book as far as understanding plain human nature it shows that no matter how far you go into the future there are some human characteristics that will never go away such as faith and greed. Foundation really opens a door for science fiction especially in the two books remaing in the trilogy you should definatly read those as for the other four that is your choice i would read the reviews before reading them.As for Foundation it is an excellent book the characters are as defined as well as can be for the time alotted for them to portray the story. This is a must read epic that spans almost a thousand years (if you read the whole series) ENJOY! ",5.0
" Foundation. Arguably the greatest creation of science fiction to date from the most prolific writer of the genre. Isaac Asimov's tour de force first graced the pages of the May edition of Astounding Science Fiction in 1942. By the time the last instalment of the saga was finished in 1992 (only a matter of weeks prior to Asimov's death) the story had gone full circle so that you finished almost where you had set off from. We are initially told of The Seldon Plan; A one thousand year strategy mathematically and statistically conceived by Hari Seldon to potentially minimise the eventual downfall of the once almost omnipotent but now crumbling Galactic Empire. Seldon's Plan is for a group of specially chosen settlers to emigrate to Terminus an uninhabited planet in a remote corner of the galaxy from where they will create the Encyclopedia Galactica a definitive omnibus of information necessary to aide a new and even stronger Empire rise long after the anarchy of it's predecessors demise.Throughout five of the seven Foundation books Asimov wrote the reader witnesses the unfolding of The Seldon Plan and how the original settlers of Terminus evolve over the centuries as the work of the long dead Seldon comes to fruition. The two 'prelude' books in the series tell of Seldon's life and his initial realisation as a young man the gravity of what must be done to save the people far into the future while simultaneously trying to instigate his master plan.Upon reading the end of the last of the books in a chronological sense (Foundation & Earth) the reader is gifted with the biggest jaw-dropping mother of all twists in the story which turns almost all of what you have read in the previous books upside down. Read Foundation and guaranteed you'll read the other six books all in immediate succession. ",5.0
" Foundation is the first of three books in the original Foundation trilogy. It's a wonderful exploration of what might be if psychology sociology and statistics could be melded together to predict the future with a high degree of reliability. I found it fascinating as a spiritual analogy even if that was unintended by Azimov. Read it through the lens of Hari Seldon as a god-type perhaps you'll find the same interesting subtext that I did.

" I like science fiction in a generalized idea but sometimes in particular it doesn't work. I think this is mainly because I see two kinds of science fiction. One is what are essentially westerns in space. The second tries to give perspective on the current times by creating some sort of objective viewpoint on current events by giving it distance in space or time. Asimov is more of the second one. I haven't read much of his work as an adult but I did like his short stories as a child in magazines. Genre stories until lately haven't had any pull in the academy so they don't get studied or legitimized scholastically. I like this second kind much better.I like this book the first of a trilogy and the foundation for several others (pun intended). Asimov explores our relation to information and the predictability of the future based on full information awareness. I will read more of these books perhaps the whole series because I enjoyed and was tantalized by the possibilities of action in the future of the series. However one interesting thing is that although Asimov was looking to the future he was still a product of his time. When he was writing the technology was nuclear and the future was nuclear. Thus the future Empire is ruled by nuclear technology. Compare for example the cyber-punk fascination with computer technology as a driving force. Computers are almost absent from the world of the Empire and the Foundation. Instead there are still newspapers (96) and messages are transferred physically. At the very least if you take this as a futurological document humanity abandoned mythological superstition. So - you have to read this book as both a look into the future and a historical document. Asimov is a fantastic writer but he couldn't overcome the limitations of his time. ",5.0
" The Foundation series is one of the most renowned arcs in all of science fiction. Spanning several volumes and thousands of years of time Asimov provides us with a blueprint for our own decadent ailing society--a prevention if you will against the society of the 21st century as realized later by men like Stephen Baxter inTitan.In the billion-star inclusive Galactic government Hari Seldon a brilliant mathematician devised a way to accurately plot the future by analyzing past events trends and movements in human history. Branded a madman he and his followers are given a kind of half-exile half-grant to the planet Terminus to found their Foundation which it seems is to be a focal point of knowledge for Seldon's predicted coming galactic catastrophe.But is that all the Foundation is? A glorified university?Asimov is the herald of a new age filled with robots spacetravel and weird technologies beyond our understanding and sometimes even our imagination. A thinker philosopher and theologian Asimov's books are chock-full of singular personality and wit.I recommend Foundation as necessary-reading to any fan of science-fiction who has somehow escaped it thus far. You will NOT be unimpressed. ",5.0
" I never imagined it would have been so political. I also never imagined I'd enjoy a political story so much. The characters are brilliant and well written. I was concerned for them despite how quickly Asimov moved on to the next group. It's more realistic this way than to have just one protagonist that you know will make it to the end of the book. This story take place over a long period of time though it provides for a surprisingly quick read. A good balance of action and brain stimuli. (Not for adrenaline junkies.) ",5.0
" Foundation is the only book I have ever read twice. The second time around I was shocked to realize that not much ever happens. There is something about this series that makes it one of the best I have ever read but I am not sure what it is. ",5.0
" Having always been a big Asimov fan (after readingmany of hisshort stories along with some of the Robot series) I was very excited to start reading the Foundation series. The Foundation series describes a world in which humans live on planets throughout the galaxy. In this world the 12000-year old Empire is in decline and Hari Seldon has established a Foundation in the corner of the galaxy in order to reconquer and rebuild a new empire after the current one dies -- he estimates the intermediary period of barbarism can be reduced from 30000 years to only 1000.Going into the first book of the series I have to say I had high expectations but this book managed to exceed them. Many people complain about the character development in these novels but while each of the five stories introduced new characters I still found each set of characters to be interesting in very important ways. Throughout these stories the question of individuality is touched on",5.0
" Throughout the past 12000 years the Galactic Empire has been expanding from Trantor its capital planet throughout the galaxy. How humans found Trantor or where Earth is (and other questions about Earth) are currently unanswerable. All that is known is that this empire which controls billions of worlds is in a permanent social and political recession -- in other words it is dying. Hari Seldon reknowned psychohistorian (AKA scientist who predicts future trends) has predicted that 30000 years will pass before a second Galactic Empire will rise. To shorten the dark age to 1000 years he has created a Foundation - a group of people dedicated to preserving knowledge - on the edge of the galaxy in the hope that they will share their knowledge after the fall of the Galactic Empire and create a new and greater Galactic Empire. Foundation is divided into four stories which go through history from Seldon's project through the ascent of the Foundation. Taking concepts from Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire Foundation is an extraordinary book and is strongly recommended to all readers of science fiction. ",5.0
" In a word story. That's what this is book is meant story. As a best-class story-teller Asimov leads the reader into an intrincated labyrhynthical STORY where mathematics play a role as important as human emotions meanwhile both are interlaced so closely and deeply that psicohistory raises up to capitalize human knowledge in 'favour' of the final survival of the galactic culture.Despite the general opinion of classical criticism  that Asimov was not quite a good SF writer but a fantasy one with no base to be considered in the universe of 'hard' sci-fi I should say that it's a long way walk between writing and simply reading a book and this may not be the most-spectacular guide to science and techno-details but it's in a way (a very particular one) the best ever writen ",5.0
" Many of the ideas and terminology is very old time and retro. The idea and plot of this book may in fact have kicked off the whole space opera sub-genre that i love so well. For more larger than life galaxy spanning sci fi mind blowing try Vernor Vinge's 'A fire Upon the Deep' ",5.0
" The fall of the Galactic Empire having been foreseen by the great Hari Seldon through his Psychohistory a colony of sorts of scholars was established on a planet far from the center of the Empire.This Foundation as the colony is referred is intended to limit the chaos sure to follow from the Empire's eventual fall. Proceeding the fall various small dominions erupt and for a time the Foundation treads water as a neutral entity but things soon come to a head and action must be taken. Unfortunately scholars are not the best equipped to handle such situations.From the outcome of these events the political structure of the Foundation is altered and from there again does a conflict occur. As there was such a concentration of intellectual beings in the Foundation there was no decline in technology as in the rest of the former Empire. And so might superior technology aid in the well-being of the Foundation as well as its regard from neighbors.This book is actually several separate stories taking place at different times in the early history of the Foundation as the citizens try to fulfill the goal of Hari Seldon now long dead but nonetheless still influential. These stories are very well written and obviously had a great deal of thought put into them as to how the collapse and restoration of such an entity might proceed. If you like REAL science fiction I highly recommend this book you won't regret it. ",5.0
" The Foundation series is the best ever. True it is set in the future but you don't have to like sci-fi at all to appreciate the true brilliance of Isaac Asimov. The Foundation is a short book. Give it a try. I'll be surprised if you don't immediately pick up the next in the series when you are done! ",5.0
" Two stories in one this book is an excellent follow up to Foundation and a dramatization of the strength of mind over muscle.First the Foundation is threateded by the Galactic Empire. While I disagree with the unimportance of the individual (after all wasn't Hari Seldon himself one person who changed history) it does show the travails as a small group of Foundationers try to stop the General when he is stopped by the very corrupt bureaucracy he serves.In the second he brings in a new factor. The Foundation secure and dominant but not agressive is threatened by the Mule a person who can control the emotions of others reshape them into whatever he wants. Part of a slightly more fantastic area of Science Fiction he still pulls it off well. This time it does come down to individual effort again to stop the Mule by opponents who could not defeat him one on one but do so by their determination and individual organization.This time he did not labor under the false assumption that he had to write a limited number of pages so he was able to flesh out the characters more and make the plot twists more intricate and did a truly excellent work.

" This is the second Foundation Novel I have read in the whole series and it just gets me more excited for the rest. This book really brings into light the tone of the series and where it can go. Honestly Asimov is a genius. ",5.0
" SPOILERS AHEAD!!!When I wrote the review for the first book in this series my review was number 336 this time I'm number 90 which probably means that most reviewers said what they had to say about the trilogy in their review of the first book. This is ironic considering this second book is where the real fun begins.I'm assuming here that you read Foundation I'm HOPING you even liked it. If you did then you will probably notice that there are only two stories in this book as opposed to the five in the previous one. Don't let the lack of quantity bother you though These stories are longer for the simple reason that they need to be.For me personally there was always something that bothered me about the premise of this series. Simply put I didn't like the fact that humanity is reduced to mathematics. That's TOO simple though because I happen to think that if you try hard enough you CAN reduce (or perhaps distill is a better word) humankind down to mathematics but the Seldon plan makes no allowance for the individual.At least that's what I thought after reading Foundation. As it turns out these two stories deal with just that theme. Not only that but they seem to state opposite views on the subject.The first part of the book finds the Foundation taking on the remains of the Great Galactic Empire. The heroes of this part are as usual simply the mouthpieces for the various viewpoints and have little personality of their own. They run about and try to save the Foundation with some daring do (but it's Asimov so the said daring do mostly involves people arguing with each other about stuff) while the Foundation calmly trounces the Empire and renders their whole storyline moot.Here the group wins out while the individual is rendered completely impotent while the group kicks butt. So group 1 individual 0Then comes the second (and significantly longer) story",5.0
" The second book in the Foundation series continues the narrative of the first; it chronicles the defeat of the decaying Galactic Empire by the Foundation and its subsequent defeat by the mutant intelligence that is the Mule. Asimov's books are an almost perfect blend of suspense action dialogue character-building world-building narrative and plot. He knows how to keep the pages turning. Even the less interesting half of the book (the first-half) is still enjoyable - it's just that the second part is so much more interesting; the twist at the end is especially something to be savored. Like all his books the joy comes from not just the narrative itself but the situations that Asimov places his characters in and how they ingeniously improvise solutions to their dilemmas. The Foundation series is irrefutably classic science fiction and it makes one wonder why Hollywood hasn't taken these literary gems and processed them into something less fine and lacking luster.One minor grievance; some phrases seem to reappear in multiple books of the series. Asimov seems particularly fond of the adjective 'sardonically' - but this can scarcely be deemed a flaw just something that one might notice. ",5.0
" The second book in the original trilogy and the fourth book overall Foundation and Empire is the great sequel to Foundation. It's really two different stories set many years apart.The first story covers the empires attempt to conquer the First Foundation led by its last great general. The second covers the mutant known as the Mule and his attempt to conquer the entire galaxy. The mysterious Second Foundation comes into play for the first time at the end of this book.Like its predecessor at only 320 pages it makes a quick and interesting read. As one of the few sequels I've ever read which isn't a let down from the book it follows I highly recommend it as well as the rest of the series. ",5.0
" Asimov has crafted a sci-fi masterpiece in this novel. It is this novel that takes the Foundation series to a new level of brilliance. While the original novel is strong this book is stronger. One advanatage of this book over its predecessor is that it is a single story as opposed to a series of novellas. This yields greater investment in the characters as they develop throughout the book. Asimov displays here all the attributes that have earned him monolithic status among sci-fi writers--unforgettable characters ahead-of-his-time technology and an entrancing plot with endless twists and turns. Essential reading for sci-fi fans. ",5.0
" Great book! Second in the series of three novels all three are worth the read. I read all three in about two and half weeks.

" I first read the foundation triology in high school in the early 60's.Nearly 50 years later reading it again was almost like reading forthe first time. Asimov added two more books later but the first threeare the real classics here. The concept of psychohistory may be as importantas the novels are good. I haven't seen any movies made from thesestories but it seems like they deserve that.Before there was ever an x-man there was the mule;that chance of genetic nature of a psi mutant who could change mens mindsas he pleased. The plan couldn't account for this but the second foundationwas never found by the mule. I recognized in the mule a manvery like the French Napoleon who could take advantage ofthe weaknesses of others. In later life Asimov became verymuch 'hard science' orientated so that these early space operatype novels were actually rationalized into an artificial unified time linethat really does a disservice to their original intension in my view.I still like this book with age!

" If you consider Star Wars as George Lucas's answer to Asmiov's 'Foundation' then this is very much in the mode of Episode V. Asimov spent the first book building up his psychohistory paradigm just to knock it down in Foundation and Empire. A much darker and more intense book downbeat in mood and leading to the inevitable conclusion in Second Foundation. ",5.0
" I think asimov truly showed his ability in Foundation and Empire. Whether or not Foundation was better is debatable. But to create 2 knockout novels is pure gift. All the people who say it is bad are wrong. they say you should read a classic. It is a classic! A modern classic! the series deserves a place among Dune and other SF greats. The Mule was stroke of genius. The surprise ending was wonderful. whatever they charge you for this it is a deal. ",5.0
" I recently read Foundation all I can say is Wow!. First let me say this is not STAR WARS and it isn't STAR TREK This is what Science Fiction is all about. Truly epic in every sense of the word Foundation offers us a window into a future so far away Earth is forgotten completly. And like any good epic their is no main character instead the story is a series of short stories. Each story features new characters and plots decades sometimes centuries apart. The best part of this book is that its only part one! I can't recommend this book enough! If you consider yourself a serious Sci-Fi fan then get this book today. ",5.0
" Foundation and Empire is the second of the original Foundation trilogy written in the 1950s. The first book is Foundation and the last is Second Foundation. I enjoyed Foundation but I liked F&E; quite a bit more! Foundation consists of five disconnected short stories too short for adequate development of the settings or characters. F&E; is much more focused containing only two stories the second of which really impressed me.A quick refresher on the background",5.0
" As in Foundation this is actually not a single story. Here are presented two separate episodes in the development of the Foundation toward the establishment of the Second Galactic Empire.The first details the encounter between the growing Foundation and the still-very-powerful Empire. At the forefront is an Imperial General of outstanding ability and charisma. Unfortunately Hari Seldon the architect of the Foundation predicted all this with his psychohistorical calculations. While the general is very successful in his opposition to the Foundation his very nature ensures his downfall.The second story is quite ingenious in that the single large failing of Seldon's psychohistory is brought to light. An individual beyond the predictive nature of psychohistory has appeared and done the impossible. While there is a type of mystery presented Asimov either wanted the reader to know the answer before the characters or he didn't try very hard to obscure the nature of things. But this is a crucial moment in the Foundation's development as they seem to be vulnerable after all. This story depends heavily on a plot element present in all the Robot-Empire- and now Foundation Series",5.0
" When Isaac Asimov was writing at his best he was the one of the best science fiction writers to ever heft a typewriter.He wrote the orginal short stories to make up the Foundation novels in the 1940's for John W. Campbell's Astounding Science Fiction Magazine. In large messure he modelled the history in the stories after the fall of the Roman Empire.Hari Seldon Salvor Hardin Hober Mallow are names that stand in the history of Science Fiction like the names of real people in many ways. 'Violence is the last resort of the incompetent' and 'Never let your morals get in the way of doing what is right' are quotes that every reader of SF knows well.Only names like Jubel Harshaw and David Bowman (who came to life from the pens of Robert Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke) rank with these characters created by Isaac Asimov. I'm not positive if this is the best SF/F novel ever written but it definitely makes the top five list of best SF novels ever written.It is a great loss to the world that Asimov slipped off his mortal coil back in 1992. His writting is great. At least we still have his books. ",5.0

" Recently I picked up a copy of the first book in Issac Asimov's Foundation series for which this review is written. I will not spoil the book in this review as some others have done.The theme was quite interesting. Essentially one man somewhat manipulates humanity into protecting its knowledge and creative abilities by setting them apart from the 'masses' so that they can weather the coming dark ages. The great joke of this book is that Asimov almost makes it seem as if history is pushed forward by the 'masses' themselves but in reality his apparent humanism and rationality comes through as he shows that it is always the 'individual' who in the end can save or destroy humanity.If you are a man (or woman) who cares about how ideas move history if you believe in the sanctity of the individual if you love life then this is a book for you.Asimov is a man of reason and he shows it well throughout this first in what I hope to be an excellent sci-fi series. Often times contemporary authors infuse their lack of values into their books and characters making one wonder who one should be rooting for. Asimov paints a clear picture of the values within man that make him worthy of praise (or not) - reason justice and a love of life.This book can proudly stand side by side with Ayn Rand's Anthem and Orwell's 1984 as a warning to society about the dangers of the 'irrational' in all its glorious forms.

" Iaasic Asimov is one of the best known Science-Fiction Writers and for good reason. He wrote this award-winning book at the age of 21. Foundation is one of the best books I have read to this date.Science Fiction is a broad area and can only be defined by these two words hence the name. Asimov utilizes very realistic facts in a novel placed 15000+ years in the future. In the year 1951 when the novel was written was just 5 years after the first computer showed its face. Yet Asimov utizlizes the common computer and calculator in many scenes in this novel.The use of nuclear power for showing superiority is also used often. This book was way ahead of its time.Anyone who enjoys science fiction or even one who just enjoys being entertained by realistic facts put into a story will enjoy this book. Foundation is also very suspenseful. Such as life-changing decisions to be made assination attempts spaceflight and the exploration of new worlds in detail the reader feels like he is in the mix of the action. ",5.0
" This novel the first in a (50's) series of three has not dated one bit since its first appearance. Like The Lord of the Rings it should really be read in combination with its sequels but the book contains its own strong moments especially the first section on Trantor. I was amazed and moved by the cleverness of Asimov's plots something he is of course well-known for. Highly recommended. ",5.0
" If you had bothered to read the entire series you would know that one of the major heroes in the book is a young girl Arkady. In fact once the Foundation books tie in with the Robot series you will find another woman hero the 'mother of robotics' Dr. Susan Calvin. So your comment about the 'deplorable' lack of women in the Foundation books is off the mark. And the characters are not poorly developed - what you learn about characters like the Mule is staggering - but you wouldn't know that because it is in the second book. I hope you don't do this with all literature - try getting the facts first then give an honest opinion. You will be well respected for it even if most people disagree with you. ",5.0
" I am making my way through the original Foundation trilogy for the third time now and I'm still gaining new appreciation for it. Fifty years after it first appeared Asimov's Foundation series can still justifiably be called a classic. A clear influence on the Star Wars saga and probably Star Trek as well along with a large chunk of all science fiction that has come since. Sure there are a few things to quibble about with this series and with this first book in particular. Asimov's vision of the distant future with its nuclear reactors microfilm communications and picture phones all seems ridiculously quaint today. As the story blasts through several decades interchangeable characters come and go without making much of an impression and this first book is so obviously part of a trilogy that it doesn't have a chance of standing on its own. But that's not the point and by focusing on these quibbles you're missing the forest for the trees. Here Asimov has created a tremendous masterpiece of the imagination that is larger in scope than just about any other literary creation. The saga is built around the intriguing concept of psychohistory in which the movements of huge masses of people can be accurately predicted over thousands of years (while it is still impossible to predict the actions of any one person). An ossifying empire obviously based on the Roman Empire in its death throes is on the verge of horrific collapse when the Foundation is created to subtly change the course of history behind the scenes and gradually rises to prominence and tries to usher in a new golden age. The entire saga (not just this first book) takes place over a thousand years across a whole galaxy while Asimov believably incorporates a full palate of psychology politics and sociology to lend the story credence. Still a masterpiece after all these years. ",5.0
" Well here goes. You mention that Foundation is dated. Of course it is it's 60 years old! You'd be surprised at how badly dated some of the stuff being written today is in 60 years. You say a galactic empire can't be made with 'atomics'; you call it good old nuclear fission. Well not all nuclear power is fission; there is also fusion which was not a bad idea for space travel in 1941. Strike one. You also mention that Asimov writes in the old 60's detective style of writing. So this dated book is writing in a style popular 20 years in the future. Strike two. You ask if anyone edited the corny dialog; you call it tripe. Of course it was edited; it was made into the editors idea of what would sell in 1941! Remember science fiction wasn't taken seriously then; it was supposed to be rather childish. One need only read later Asimov work (something you admittedly haven't done) to see that he wrote for the market at the time. Books such as 'The Gods Themselves' even have (gasp) sex in them something that would never have gotten past any editor at the time of Foundation. And guess what? It was written in 1972 a time when society as a whole was more tolerant and ready to accept such topics. 'The Gods Themselves' would have been banned as obscene in 1941. Strike three. To answer your query - Why in the name of antimatter would a galactic civilization be organized along the lines of a fuedal system as were the Middle Ages? - why not? Just because it isn't very popular nowadays on Earth doesn't mean it can't work elsewhere. Besides the story is a retelling of the decline of Rome - shouldn't there be obvious parallels? Strike four. You mention that the plot doesn't go anywhere. How would you know? You've only read one book. Asimov does a brilliant job of reconciling the original trilogy with the robot novels - especially considering he began the fourth novel 40 years after the original trilogy was written. At a minimum to really understand the story you would have to read at least the next two books. Strike five. You say the book is pointless. Well ask yourself this. If that were true would it have near-unanimous rave reviews? Are you one of a select few that have been able to see the book for what it truly is - a piece of junk? No the reality is that the state of science fiction in 2001 is that it is generally read by intelligent people - thoughtful well-read and informed. The wool hasn't been pulled over their eyes it has been pulled over yours. Strike six. And you misspelled premises and neutrino - Strike seven. You lose. ",5.0

" Foundation clearly deserved its awards and recognition for being a classic science fiction novel. The creative and unique story line presents the reader a sensation of the future. In the beginning of the book Hari Seldon was introduced as a psychohistorian and mathematician who could chart the future of the human race for tens of thousands of years. He predicted a decline of the Galactic Empire which had lasted for twelve thousand years into a state of disorder and barbarism for the next thirty thousand years. Hari Seldon then established the Foundation to serve as the purpose of shortening the period of chaos into a single millennium or less.The book was extremely enjoyable and the pages went by fast. However the only problem I had was that once I got to know the characters the story went on to a situation a couple decades later with new characters. Though it bothered me the way the author wrote his novel was necessary to put a whole century's plot into a book. Despite the many characters in the story the author created a distinct personality for each. Yet each of the leaders in the different parts of the book were similar in a way; they all dealt with conflict extremely calmly and ingeniously. They cleverly manipulated their enemies with their words and were always prepared against threats or opposition. They knew how to win the people's votes even when they were in a weak position to run for a government position. I could not help but to ponder about what I would have done in each of the situations. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone that likes science fiction or anyone who likes reading about how characters cleverly solve their problems. ",5.0
" I think this is a great book by itself and worth the time in reading it but if you have time I would recommend reading the whole series. If you do that you might want to start with 'Prelude to Foundation' but you don't have to. Pick up this book right away! ",5.0

" On first reading of this trilogy starting with Foundation I was a bit bored by the politics. But all three books were in one volume so I kept reading. I'm glad I did! Every time I've read them since I discover something new to love. The ending of this book blew my mind! If there is such a thing as a literary high I was on one for a week after reading this eight years ago. No book or movie you can name comes close to this kind of thrill or scope. And just when I thought Asimov couldn't take it any further he does with a character's last statement. By now the Foundation has gained dominance over its surrounding enemies. All part of Hari Seldon's (the Foundation's founder) Plan. And they are strong enough to face the Empire. The first half of the book is a power struggle of the leaders of the Empire more politics and a small band of traders rebels and scholars who wait for the coming of the 'magicians' to someday be their saviors. The second half of the book follows a small group of people belonging to the Democratic Underground who expect major political changes for the next Seldon Crisis. They hear of a man who calls himself the Mule. Generals surrender to him without a fight. His worst enemies become his most faithful subordinates. They seek him out thinking he can help their cause. No one can explain the success of the Mule. Where did he come from? Was he planned by Hari Seldon? Hari Seldon appears as before as a hologram explaining the crisis and the course of action. But he makes no mention of the Mule. Everything has gone awry and Seldon's plan is out of whack and the galaxy might revert to the 30000 years of barbarism Seldon was trying to avoid. Hari Seldon counted on several things that there would be no major changes in the galaxy's technology such as something that could withstand any bombardment or strange neurobiological weapons; and that human reaction to stimuli would remain constant. If it's not the first it must be the second-- the Mule has mental powers. How do they fight him? By seeking out this Second Foundation. Hari Seldon mentioned it vaguely but there is no record of its purpose and no proof of its existence. This same small band from the D.U. including a psychologist (as the Foundation considers one) set off to the center of what's left of the Empire The planet/city Trantor to search Seldon's records. The whole time managing to stay out of the way of the Mule's path of destruction and ends with the awesome climax I mentioned. Does the Second Foundation even exist? What is their purpose? The psychologist working on overdrive seems to have found its location. 'It was so simple' he said. But he doesn't live to reveal his discovery. Did he really find it or was his mind too distorted to make any sense? There are more surprises and excitement to come in the trilogy's third installment Second Foundation. Some people have the gall to call these books wordy or boring. Keep in mind that Lord of the Rings had its slow parts too but the few exciting parts are what you remember and hold it all together. It's better to take these books as a whole. For that one is not necessarily better than the other two they are all essential to the whole story line. Perhaps someday we can look forward to a mutilated Hollywood version then go back and re-read the books and hold them dear to our hearts. ",5.0
" From Selvor Hardin taking power from the encyclopedists to Hober Mallow conquering Korell by doing absolutely nothing I found this to be the best sci-fi novel ever. Ender's Game and Dune don't hold a candle to it. Each story is a 10 on it's own. The way the foundation grabs victory from apparent defeat is amazing. Even though Isaac Asimov (my favorite sci-fi author) has nuclear power be able to do anything it doesn't take away from the story. It's the best book of the foundation series for sure. If you read sci-fi you've got to read this. ",5.0
" By now you should be familiar with psychohistory and the exploits of Hari Seldon Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow. If that first sentence just left you slightly confused then go pick up Isaac Asimov's 'Foudation' before reading 'Foundation and Empire'. 'Foundation and Empire' picks up where 'Foundation' left off with the First Foundation rapidly expanding throughout the galaxy. In 'The General' (the first half of 'Foundation and Empire) Foundation space bumps up against what remains of the old Empire and the Foundation must square off with Bel Riose the last great Empire general. This story is basically a continuation of the ideas started in 'Foundation'. 'The General' is definitely the weaker of the two stories in 'Foundation and Empire' however it is a necessary story to show the growing strength and influence of the First Foundation as well as the decline of the Empire.'The Mule' (the second half of 'Foundation and Empire') tells the story of the Mule a mysterious galactic superpower who begins conquering planets in Foundation space. The leaders of the Foundation struggle against their new enemy and try to figure what it is that makes the Mule so efficient and effective. Meanwhile a small group of characters working for an underground group try to find the all important location of the Second Foundation before the Mule can beat them to it. The ending of 'The Mule' is absolutely amazing and the grand reveal at the end can be foreseen by an observant reader which makes it all the more satisfying.In short 'Foundation and Empire' along with the rest of Asimov's Foundation Series is a great science fiction story beautifully blending advanced mathematical and scientific ideas with good ol' fashioned adventure. Some readers complain that Asimov's characters are not as deep as they could be and they do have a point but Asimov never wrote the Foundation books with the intent of having deep realistic characters; it was all about the story and the ideas. If you are looking for strong characters in your science fiction then go read Heinlein however if you are looking for a drop dead fantatic story propelled by great scientific speculation then you can't go wrong with picking up 'Foundation and Empire' and the rest of the Foundation Series.

" This is tied for first place in all books I have read (other book is Atlas Shrugged). The series in all is great but this book tops them all. Imagine a combination of psychology and math used to predict the outcome of population mobs and how a man would apply it to an empire he sees falling apart (not really a spoiler cause that's a bit of what they tell you in first 2ish chapters). This book is great not just because of the idea but because the characters are relatable face extremely difficult situations and yet take what seems to be the only logical way out. I highly suggest you read this book and the whole series. ",5.0

" Isaac Asimov's 'Foundation' was my favorite book in high school. I read the other 2 books afterwards 'Foundation and Empire' and 'Second Foundation' right after and by then Asimov finally finished what he started so long ago by writing new books to the Foundation saga more Robot novels and prequels. I am re-reading Foundation right now only this time on my Kindle. It's just as good now as it was 20+ years ago. Asimov's novels remind me of Star Trek because the stories could probably fit in any time or place including right now. My only issue is that Asimov is deceased for a number of years now. Other writers have tried to take on the challenge of continuing his stories but no one tells a story like Asimov! ",5.0
" Over the years I have read a great many books from many many authors and yet the 'Foundation' series pops back into my head somewhat regularly. I often wonder why it has not been made into a series of movies. After all in my mind it would rival 'Star Wars' or 'Lord of the Rings'. Isaac Asimov was a gifted writer and I was fortunate to know his works while he still lived. Unfortunately I never got to meet the man. This series is some of the best stuff he ever wrote. It delves into humananity and how our unique abilities may sometimes stand out. In the case of 'Foundation' it centers around one empire and it's unusual ruler that expands their domain beyond any other into the far reaches of space. It looks closely at how a handful of people truly make a difference in the scheme of things and what becomes of that empire. Another great series the 'Robot' series was later linked to this series and although I enjoyed the link not everyone may enjoy it. Nonetheless you should read the 'Robot' series as well if you get the chance. I will be very surprised if after you set the 'Foundation' series aside it doesn't make you reflect on it the rest of your life. Excellent read from a master of SciFi. ",5.0
" To me the Foundation series is the greatest sci-fi series of all time. The earlier books are the best as the latter books aren't as good. This is favorite of the earlier books.It's broken into two halves. The first half is pretty good but it's really the second half called The Mule that's incredible. It's fantastic.It's style isn't like modern sci-fi which is usually dark and action-packed. If that's what you're looking for you won't enjoy this series. This series is much more about imagining a universe with a certain set of rules and how those rules might play out over time. To enjoy it you have to think and imagine along with Asimov. If that 'golden age' style sci-fi suites your taste you will love this book.Obviously you can't read this book in isolation. You really need to read the Foundation before it and Second Foundation after it. The three togother make the best triology I've ever read. After those three you can continue but the quality of the books trails off from there.If you're a 'golden age' sci-fi fan and somehow haven't already read the Foundation series get the first three Foundation books. You'll really enjoy them especially The Mule. ",5.0

" Fifteen years ago this book was the zenith of SF to me. Today I know there are many better books. But you should read it anyway it's a classic. You can't be taken seriously in any SF discussion if you aren't familiar with the great Foundation.Isaac Asimov is of course a very skilled writer. Most SF writers allow themselves embarrassing blunders that make their universes physically absurd. In this book you're not likely to find anything like that. To really appreciate Mr. Asimov's genius you should read other SF novels written in the same time. Nearly all of them look ridiculous in the year 2000. Mr. Asimov's books don't. If you wouldn't know you couldn't tell that the book was written half a century ago. ",5.0

" Foundation is the first book of the outstanding Foundation Trilogy. Asimov builds drama with believable characters struggling against bureaucracies and political manipulations on a grand scale. As a central government weakens planets often show less respect for the core authorities and go there own way sometimes forming their own alliances. Hari Seldon master of Psychohistory uses Psychohistory to make predictions far into the future. Hari Seldon does more than predict outcomes--he has a plan. Seldon does not expect to alter the eventual course of huge historical events but constructs a strategy to minimize the length of time of the darkest days for the Galactic Empire.The emphasis of the book and what makes the book a true science fiction classic is the imagination that takes the reader through mind whirring possibilities for the future.

" 'Foundation and Empire' the second in a trilogy of classic science fiction novels by Isaac Asimov is a must read for historians of science fiction. For those who like science fiction itself this volume is also valuable. Asimov can madden especially in his early novels but his imagination is wonderful. His strength is conceptualizing systems (whether empires or cultures) and he often plays with big ideas.I first read the trilogy while in college and was fascinated. This triggered a long-lasting interest in the fiction of Isaac Asimov (and some of his non-fiction works as well).Those familiar with this trilogy know that the key character is psychohistorian Hari Seldon who believes that one can predict the behavior of large masses of people via mathematical equations and thus predict how events will develop in the future.This book is a bridge between the novel 'Foundation' and the third in the series 'Second Foundation.' And of course later in his career Asimov returned to the Foundation well--with more interesting and literary results. Indeed in one of the great tour de forces in science fiction he ends up linking two classic series--the robot works and the Foundation series. But I'm getting way ahead of myself.This novel focuses on two instances--one the rise of a youthful and talented military leader who goes after the Foundation. And just as Hari Seldon's mathematical equations predicted he failed. The logic for this is classic Asimov and is why he was so entertaining to read even though his characters have little life in these works and even though his writing style is at best functional in these works (he improved with time).Then there is the case of the Mule where Seldon's equations failed in prediction. And that itself is fascinating as explained in this novel. Thus the comparison of the correct prediction and the failed prediction add some real heft to Asimov's tale of the rise of the Foundation as the Empire slowly descends to its end.For those who have never read Asimov the Foundation trilogy is a good place to get a sense of his talents of seeing big pictures. His writing style is not great but the images of this future that he developed are compelling. I still enjoy going back to the Foundation series the Robot series and their fusion as Asimov's vision evolved. ",5.0

" Isaac Asimov's 'Foundation' was not conceived as the beginning of series of novels. It was not conceived as a novel. It was not even conceived entirely by Isaac Asimov.Beginning in the late 1930s and for decades thereafter the editor of the most prestigious and far more important the best-paying monthly publication in science fiction was John W. Campbell of Astounding Science Fiction (now known as Analog.)Before taking over the editorship of the magazine Campbell had been a popular hack writer of unabashed wild-eyed space opera. A typical Campbell plot involved a couple of young American go-getters who whomp up a superduper space cruiser in their garage set out on a test flight around Saturn find themselves hurled into another dimension by a short circuit and stumble on a planet inhabited by humans who are at war with some interplanetary Nasties who display unusually bad table manners. They forge an alliance with the good humans against the bad Nasties which a few hundred pages later inevitably leads to the utter annihilation of the world of the Nasties not to mention the Nasties themselves and every vestige of their million year-old civilization and culture. By the literary standards of pulp magazine science fiction in 1936 this was pretty sophisticated stuff.When Campbell took over the reins of the magazine in 1938 he raised his sights. In short order he dumped the old stable of writers whose collective knowledge of science could have been stuffed into a peanut shell with room to spare and began cultivating new ones. A. E. van Vogt specialized in social science mumbo-jumbo that actually sounded like it meant something. L. Sprague deCamp had a sense of humor. Robert Heinlein possessed a literary spark that might be carefully fanned into a flame. And Isaac Asimov was a college kid from Brooklyn who wrote stories to stretch out the limited income generated by his father's candy store.All these and many others were overawed by the wondrous fact that the godlike JWC deigned to accept their humble stories--after he mercilessly picked apart their flaws and demanded re-writes pronto!Those were the heroic days of magazine publishing. Editors in general and Campbell in particular did not wait for undisciplined and slothful writers to hatch ideas. No JWC would call in his disciples and hand out plot lines and devices to be made into short stories novelets and serialized novels. To van Vogt he tossed the idea of a totalitarian society whose tyranny was leavened by weapons shops that sold guns which could only be used in self defense. From deCamp citing Mark Twain's 'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' he demanded to know what would happen if a contemporary American were hurled back from Mussolini's Italy to post-imperial Rome. Of Heinlein he demanded a series of stories that would collectively outline the history of the next few hundred years. For Asimov he reserved a far larger patch of history. What he queried would happen when a galaxy-spanning empire finally decayed and began to fall?Asimov pondered. Then in his own words 'With a little bit of cribbin' / From the works of Edward Gibbon / And that Greek Thucydides' Asimov took the Roman Empire of the Fifth Century and cast it into the stars as the expiring Empire of Trantor. From Eighteenth Century France he took the Encyclopedists and renamed them the Foundation. Finally he spiced up his literary gumbo with blather about 'psychohistory' a mathematically-based fortune telling system which yielded valid results when the human population achieved the vast numbers only attainable in a galaxy-spanning civilization.Campbell bought the first story. The fans--at the time a demographic aged 12-25 and virtually all-male--loved it. Campbell ordered more stories. The Trantorian Empire fell but slowly and reluctantly. The fans loved it. The Empire blazed up under the last great imperial general Bel Riose. (Gibbon's Belisarius get it?) The fans loved it. A Napoleon-like conqueror appeared to muddy up the predictions of the psychohistorians. The fans loved it. Darkness and barbarism followed the collapse of civilization across the Milky Way. And the fans loved it. On and on it went to book to trilogy beyond--even to new books written by other hands long after the passing of Campbell and Asimov.The fans still love it. ",5.0
" Foundation is not a novel but a series of stories which had been published separately. The entire trilogy was written in nine stories which were completed in the period between 1941 and 1951. Asimov notes himself in the foreword that part of what he intended with the fourth book _Foundation's Edge_ was to have a chance to write an actual Foundation novel.I actually like the effect that the story-based approach gives particularly considering that Foundation is meant to be covering the fall of galactic empire and the rise of a new power. Having chapters based on discrete periods I think the reader gets a better sense of the sheer time involved in politics than any 9000 -page space opera could ever achieve.One of the things I like about Foundation and its subsequent other parts is that it isn't an action-packed adventure. There isn't high romance. It isn't really about individual heartache and success although the role of the individual is important. It's a meditative look at both politics and the future and a darned sharp one at that.An excellent read even worth the time for people who don't think that they like science fiction. ",5.0
" Personally I don't like 'classic' sci-fi. It can be preachy dated dry corny or just not as 'mature' as modern science fiction. However Asimov gives just enough characterization not too much science and the right amount of action adventure and conceptual gems to keep your mind racing. He truly is the grand daddy of science fiction.Quirky lines like 'Galaxy knows!' or 'By Seldon!' evoke nostalgia for the time of space rangers and laser guns. So what if nuclear power is a thing of the past? Asimov doesn't beat you down with tecnobabble. You just know that thats the prime power source in his idea of the future. Remember this was written in 1941. Furthermore the writing style and dialogue don't seem dated at all. Asimov's writing is simple clean and doesn't get bogged down with excess ramblings. His true talent is in plotting unexpected twists and turns that make this book a pageturner.Hari Seldon created psychohistory. It is mathematics applied to the development of human society on a grand scale. Seldon's new science predicts the path of human civilization with no regard to individual actions. Religion has given us fate vs. free will. Asimov poses a perhaps even more frustrating question what if science tells us that one man's will cannot change the path of history?You're not going to get soliquoys droning on and on about a lost love or a crumbled courage; But what you do get is a brilliant collection of short stories Asimov wrote separately that later were compiled as one novel.The four(?) stories are brief yet cohesive glimpses into the developing stages of the Foundation's rise amidst the decay of the Imperial Empire. Each character driven event propels the Foundation through its first stages of development",5.0
" Asimov's classic series has a quaint nave simplicity about it that never fails to entrance this reader. For all its episodic construction (unavoidable considering the unparalleled scope) and its rather flat exclusively male characters the Foundation Trilogy takes readers back to a time when America was making the world safe for democracy personal freedoms were a given and science seemed to be the salvation of a fallible humanity.The first volume Foundation sets up the whole idea of the Seldon Plan a mathematically based view of sociopolitical forces that enables one brilliant scientist to mold a new galactic empire from a foundation of one hundred thousand scientists and their families. After the introduction whose final paragraphs subtly lay out the whole structure without our knowing it we get to see the Plan in action as the Foundation faces a series of political and military crises. Because the scientist/hero is long dead before the second chapter the heroes are the political and economic rather than scientific leaders who must resist the temptation to take direct military action and instead allow events to proceed until Seldon's Plan points out the answer. The magic of this book is the exquisite means the Foundation uses to defeat its enemies without resorting to force and the convincing arguments Asimov uses to make these solutions seem inevitable. As such each chapter is like a sociopolitical puzzle that challenges the reader to find the move that will defuse each situation and taken together these stories comprise a virtual primer in diplomacy.Countless millions of fans have enjoyed Asimov's Foundation Trilogy consisting of Foundation Foundation and Empire and Second Foundation. Other Foundation novels written by the master in his later years lack the simple charm that makes these earlier works so popular. They were tacked on solely because the power of those first three created a demand that Asimov felt obligated to try to fill but they have an entirely different feel and don't possess that single-minded surety of artistic vision that marked the original series.This book is about political maneuvering not action so it may not be a favorite of action/adventure fans although the next book in the series Foundation and Empire is a little more dynamic and reading the complete Trilogy is a must since the first two volumes don't so much end as just leave off. Still the vast historical vision begun in this book is so sweeping it should not be missed by any fans of speculative fiction. ",5.0
" This book is the best scifi besides Dune. The book is so witty and so indepth. The story is great the writting is great i strongly recamend this book. ",5.0
" The original Foundation trilogy won the Hugo for the best series of all time. It deserved it. For those who like 'hard' (science-driven) sci-fi as opposed to emotion-driven sci-fi this is a must. Actually the premise is not as outrageous as it first appears... We can all vaguely predict the general reaction of the human race to a certain idea which means it does follow some rules. It would be difficult but not impossible to find some generalised maths to describe it but the rewards would certainly justify it. ",5.0
" This review is intended for the entire Foundation trilogy and as such this series of books even though written in pieces in Science Fiction magazines is woven together in an astonishingly complex web of ideas and mystery. This series stands as the epitome of the science fiction classic what science fiction should be about and how it should be written. As a classic it is only superseded by 'Dune' and only a few others come close eg 'Ender's Game' (Orson Scott Card) series and the 'Galactic Milieu' series (Julian May). The whole series is epic and yet does not loose sight of the characters or the story which is all important in science fiction without it the wizz-bang effect takes hold and the whole thing collapses eg Terminator could not have been held together without the excellent storyline. Other examples of great science fiction stories include 'Blade Runner' and 'Alien' both of which had great stories without a reliance on effects which some films have done eg the extra added graphics to the original Star Wars and too much graphics in Episode 1.These stories also provide a fascinating tale of science yet to come such as psychohistory which totally fascinated me when I read about it and some other physicists I have known. The possibilities are incredible a science of probabilistic mathematics used to predict the future given historical events. In addition we are of course confronted with the politics and the usual human weaknesses including greed corruption and the like much akin to the degenerate aspects of the Roman Empire. The new mathematics of psychohistory developed by Hari Seldon working on Trantor and trying to set up the two Foundations to at least control the eventual collapse and fall of humanity into a dark age and the Mule the one person not predicted by the original theory who is the defeated through remarkable twists and turns in the story which is full of intrigue and mystery simply unputdownable. I have read the books many times and will do so again although psychohistorical mathematics is beyond current attainability I believe but then maybe not.Other books are judged next to this. ",5.0
" I've seen a few bad reviews of Isaac Asimov's Foundation and it grieves me really grieves me. When Isaac Asimov first came up with the idea for his Foundation series it was planned that he would write the future history of our galaxy. It could be said that it was an experiment in a method of writing fiction.If Asimov's characterizations or scenery descriptions seem bland or garish to some readers that's because Asimov's focus was on the story. Despite Foundation's original ad hoc nature I have read no other series which has so intricately weaven the elements of the plot so finely together. Alone the novel Foundation may seem mundane and it may not be your best bet if you're seeking instant gratification. But together - together with the other two books in the trilogy together with the two later written sequels together with the later two written prequels together with his other bodies of work which have been woven into an expansive interplay of stories and plot together with three 'pre'prequels written posthumously by outside authors I know no greater complicated work that brings with it such depth and expansiveness.In short Foundation serves as a sounding board for a series of future historical accounts. And Asimov never fails to deliver suspense drama and surprise throughout them.But that's just my biased opinion ;) ",5.0
" So you're thinking about delving into Science Fiction and you just don't know where to start.Start with Asimov's _Foundation_. Simply put this is where science fiction starts. You will be introduced to the concept of a vast complex history of a civilization which is certainly not Planet Earth... and get this it was written several decades before we sent anyone to the moon.And there's more... Foundation leads to an entire trilogy which leads to another trilogy which get this actually leads you back to Planet Earth.Five stars. Possibly more. ",5.0
" I would recommend this series to anyone. Asimov is a great writer who's very prolific (He's written over 400 books! ) This is the start of his Foundation series which is a well-developed series detailing the fall of a Galactic Empire and one man's attempt to shorten the dark ages that are to come after the fall. For those of you who like hard sci-fi this is the series for you. ",5.0
" Ultimately the hardest decision about the Foundation books is to decide how to read them. Maybe I'm being ridiculous but I think you will enjoy them more if you read them in the order they were written. If so this is the second book. If you have not yet read Foundation then you need to go back and do so before tackling this one.Your other choice is to read the prequels first then go onto Foundation. In that case this is the fourth book you should read.Whichever choice you make don't read this book first.On the surface Foundation and Empire will seem like an uninspired playing out of Hari Seldon's vision for the future. Ah! But there's much more happening so pay attention. When you get to the end of the book you may find you have missed the mainstream and will have to go back. Don't worry almost everyone has that reaction.Asimov is a brilliant conceptual writer but not someone who slaved over every word (in fact he was famous for writing most of his many books in only 1 or 2 drafts with little editing after that). This book begins to develop the full Foundation concept in all of its stunning beauty.In many ways you will be reading this book from the eyes of the first Foundation. But that's the unimportant one. The real action is with the second Foundation. Be sure to keep that in mind.When you meet the Mule don't think of him as an aberration but rather as an extension of today's potential. That will make the book more interesting for you.Many people find this book to be the least interesting one of the Foundation series. Let me warn you that reading this one will greatly increase your pleasure in the following books beginning with the Second Foundation (which is your next pleasant reading assignment).Enjoy this irresistible series! ",5.0
" You can read the publisher's summary for yourself but let me just add that this is THE classic SF trilogy. Book one 'Foundation' creates the future world its declining culture and how a group of strong-minded individuals don't want to see knowledge die. How they do that drives this novel. In book two Asimov introduces the mystery of the mule and in book three Asimov pulls a rabbit out the hat called the Second Foundation.If you enjoy books that entertain books that offer good mysteries and books that make you think about bigger things in life than this series is for you. It's too bad our political leaders don't read novels like this. Maybe we'd avoid the continual messes they get countries in. ",5.0
" I have not readf the Foundation series in years. However the other day I was thinking about how much fun the trilogy had been. One has to remember that most of the scifi you read today has at least some of its roots based in Asimov's work Asimov was not the best writer nor was he the most creative. What he did accomplish was selling you another time and world that you could believe in. So taking it for what it is not a great piece of literature but a really enjoyable trip i need to give the trilogy 5 stars. ",5.0
" I always prefer to think of the foundation Trilogy as one book.They are meant to be read one after another and are also written that way.While the first part(Foundation) gives us the historical perspective and a sketch of characters who influence the eventsthis book is where it gets better in a serious way!!There is not much of a point in discussing the plot-lots of other people have commented on that.But i'll tell you this - the 2nd part of this book- which talks about the Mule and his rise to power is THE best part of the ENTIRE FOUNDATION series ( Yes all the 7 books!!).IT ends with the most famous twist on paper it will make your mind reel!! It sets up the things nicely for the Second foundation - the 3 book in the series.I have read almost everything that Asimov's written.The foundation series and the End of Eternity are my favourites.The difference between Asimov and the other Science Fiction writers is that he makes the Science Fiction believable.Asimov is also a very good mystery writer(no kidding!! - he's right up there with the authors who write mystery alone).It's easy to write a Sci Fi book with an amazing amount of Science and imagination- but how well you can bind it to a story and make it real that is the deal.Apart from the idea the story has to be told well. This is where the good doctor excelled.Trust me if you have not read the Foundation Series you are missing something which in indelibly written in the records as the one of the best books on paper.Asimov's written it so that you are sufficiently intrested for more at the end of the book one  by the time you finish the second book you are thinking this is great stuff - desperate for more you go the 3rd book. By the time you are through you think this is soooo cool - it might be the best thing you ever read.Do yourself a favour go read the Foundation and Empire  follow that up with the Second Foundation.You'll be glad you did when you return to it over the years!! ",5.0
" I just finished Foundation and Empire and so far it is my favorite in the series....Foundation presented us a struggling organization of scientists on the Planet Terminus who must deal with the newly formed barbarian kingdoms that arise from the retreating Empire. Important figures within the Foundation use religion trade and technology to dominate over adversarial planets....In Foundation and Empire we are given a new perspective on the Foundation. Before we were lead to believe that the Foundation must survive and that no one could hinder its progess; that Hari Seldon's predictions of the Foundation were infallible; that the 1000 year plan was set in stone and that a new Galactic Empire will arrise in such time thanks to Hari Seldon. However these beliefs are put into question when an individual calling himself 'The Mule' threatens to destroy Hari Seldon's 300 year old project. He is a mutant of considerable mental powers who can seemingly convert anyone into his cause even the greatest opponent. Thus we are asked 'Does Hari Seldon's precious Psychohistory take random genetic mutation into account? If not then is it possible for the Mule to destroy the Foundation?'...I loved the ending to Foundation and Empire. Like Empire Stikes Back it leaves you hanging desperately wanting to find out what happens to the main characters (and the galaxy) after the book ends....I've always loved enigmatic characters in books. The Mule fits this catagory which in my mind makes him even more sinister and evil. We never see him or hear him speak (for all those who have read the book don't say anything) and yet we experience his destructive force. It reminds me of Sauron of The Lord of the Rings. At the end however we are given a profound revelation of the Mule that adds a new dimension to his character....All in all it was the dispair and depression in the book that captured me. There was little hope and yet the human spirit was still evident. I applaud Asimov for creating a believable story in which death destruction and dispair overshadow an entire galaxy but hope and determination remain. This theme I think is present throughout the series and in my opinion is the most important human quality that makes us who we are. The foundation is ultimately an exploration of this theme. Clearly Hope is the most formiddble force that human history and according to Asimov the galaxy has ever seen. ",5.0

There are 14 books in the series! In the end it was R.

" The time frame in which the book takes place can best be described as 'A Long time ahead in a galaxy far far away'. Yes that is a cheesy Star Wars cliche. However readers expecting anything star warsey about this should expect to be sorely disappointed. This book focuses primarily on politics. There is not one ounce of violence in the book which is a good thing it is a nice break from almost everyother contemporary scifi novel which all seem to impress people with their space ships 'n' aliens. The book is very good but sometimes does get a little boring. I suppose this may be my fault as I do have a short attention span. Anyhow this book does a few twists in it as everything may not be what it seems with Hari Seldons dream!So if you've been on the fringe of being a sci fi fan but detest the embarassment of carrying around a book with giant robots on it this book is for you.

" Foundation is the story of one man's attempt to positively influence human history beyond the grave for centuries to come. Set far in the future Hari Seldon's goal is to shorten an impending period of Dark Ages from tens of thousands of years to one thousand years. To do so he creates an organizational entity the Foundation and maneuvers to create circumstances so that the Foundation will recreate the Galactic Empire amid a blossoming of science and technology.This book is the first in a series that will keep you happily reading for days. In Foundation the stage is set for the problem and you will begin to understand the plan that Seldon has employed by examining the first 150 years after the Foundation is established.The book is built around four crises (Seldon Crises) that shape the potential of the First Foundation to fulfill its goal. In the first crisis the Foundation is viewed as being a traitorous activity by the political authorities. Seldon explains that his purpose is to create an encyclopedia to encompass all current knowledge before it is lost. The crisis is survived when he agrees to take the project into exile on a planet with few natural resources at the far edge of the galaxy.Fifty years later that fledgling is threatened by its powerful neighbors who have greater resources and military power. The Emperor can no longer protect the Foundation. Thirty years after that another attempt to militarily capture the Foundation occurs. Another seventy years later a fourth crisis occurs when remnants of the Empire start funneling advanced weapons to planets at the edge of galaxy that oppose the Foundation.Each crisis is overcome with a different approach by a different leader. And the Foundation continues to develop towards its eventual form.These crises are much like a good mystery story. You know there's been a crime that needs to be solved but you haven't quite figured out how yet. Because there are four crises you get to enjoy that problem-solving experience four times in one book! Pretty neat!The Foundation's advantage in all of these crises is that it has advanced knowledge and has applied it while the rest of the Empire is losing knowledge. Pretty soon things are falling apart technically for those outside the Foundation. The key technology is built around atomic power (as it appeared it would developed in the 1950s).Reviewing Foundation is a challenging task. This book has become a science fiction classic yet many will see little value in it because the science fiction perspectives and forecasts about science are dated. The book has to be read in the context of the books that follow to be fully understood and appreciated but how does that help the person who has just finished Foundation? Isaac Asimov used a most unusual style in the book as though you are a historian uncovering bits of primary and secondary sources concerning a long ago period in time (that occurs in our future). That either makes the book more authentic (if you like that) or annoying (if you don't).At bottom these contrasts require the reviewer to attempt to capture for the potential reader what makes this book an enduring classic.First Foundation squarely asks a fundamental question",5.0
" In his Foundation Trilogy (later to be extended in additional books) the prolific science fiction/fact writer Isaac Asimov told a story of a small group of people who secretly steered the course of history using technology that we would now recognize as an outgrowth of memetics. By recognizing group psychology and the effect of various memes on populations they were able (Asimov creates) to shorten the intergalactic Dark Ages by millennia. Is such a thing possible? We are seeing the beginnings of attempts at memetic engineering today. Advertisers are designing memes that are becoming fairly effective at penetrating populations in hope that they will carry with them a message influencing consumer buying behavior. Have you heard someone say 'I love ya man!' lately? Anheuser-Busch is delighted if you have. More broadly I'm seeing a steady trickle of organizations copying and mutating successful Profit Viruses (MLMs) and Power Viruses (cults). It's an interesting question whether the population as a whole will ever build up an 'immunity' to this kind of thing or whether the evolutionary-psychology buttons of lust power fear and so on are too powerful to overcome. Who knows? There may have been a small group of Illuminati steering us for millennia past without us even knowing...--Richard Brodie author Virus of the Mind",5.0
" In response to the reader from San Fransisco who gave this book a 3 they should know that the reasons the characters don't match up is because the first three foundation books were written 30 years before the last three. Furthermore they were written out of order Foundation was the first and the other two Prelude to Foundation and Forward the Foundation were written 35-40 years later. Also the stories were not 'tacked on' each of the first three books is actually a collection of connected novellas which orignally were published seperately in magazines. ",5.0
" Simply the best science fiction series ever. No one macthesAsimov in the combination of thought provoking futurism andsheer out and out entertainment. This book will get youstarted on the rest of the series (which you willimmediately want to read) and hopefully on a long career ofreading all of Asimov's fiction. The Good Doctor's greatestcontribution to the genre is the notion that brains willalways win out over brawn. His plot twists never turn onmajor battles or laser fights but always with the triumphof reason. It's all here in abundance. ",5.0
" Though 'Foundation' was later tied to many other novels and stories that Isaac Asimov wrote many of us considered this story to be the first of the Foundation Trilogy. We meet Hari Seldon and learn of the beginning of psychohistory. Hari has predicted using psychohistory that the 12000 year old galactic empire is facing eminent collapse. Hari determined through this calculations that the collapse of the empire will lead to 30000 years of chaos before a second empire forms. Hari also determined that by taking certain actions that the 30000 years of chaos could be shortened to 1000 years.Considering that this novel is only 256 pages long it covers a lot of ground. The novel begins on the ultra-urbanized planet Trantor and then heads to the edge of the galaxy. We watch the empire collapse and then the struggles of the Foundation as they attempt to re-start civilization. We also watch as the Foundation changes from a religious organization to a scientific one.This novel is the best of the first three Foundation books. Part of the reason may be that these stories were originally short stories. Also Asimov was not trying to form a single cohesive story lasting 1000 years; at this time he was just trying to launch an idea. I sometimes think it is easier to launch an epic adventure than it is to evolve the epic over hundreds or thousands of pages. Certainly Asimov's launch in this book was grand and is one of the best classic science fiction novels.The next two books in this series are 'Foundation and Empire' and 'Second Foundation.'Enjoy!

" We already knew that 'psychohistorian' Hari Seldon had predicted the demise of the galactic empire and to shorten the length of time for 'barbarism' he established two Foundations. He placed these at oppposite ends of the galaxy one known one unknown. Things were going smoothly until the periodic prediction (when Seldon appears holographically) was obviously wrong.The cause is the Mule a mutant of incredible mental powers who no one has ever seen. The introduction of this character was one of the best plot devices used in a long time and it gave the fledging story a much-needed boost. Who is this mutant and why does he do the things he does?

" This is truly a defining book for the genre of science fiction. The beauty of this tale is that Asimov began penning it when he was only twenty one years old. The story centers around a falling empire and the many characters throughout its history that define it. It also deals with a sort of scientific prophecy in what is termed 'psychohistory'. This is the manner in which the future can be predicted using scientific evidence and the laws of probability. This is truly a masterpiece of the genre. A standard which all sci-fi authors should hope to attain. I would recommend this read to anyone that is a science fiction fan. Many readers are familiar with Orson Scott Card. This is the novel which prompted him to become a writer. That this novel is a cornerstone in the genre is an understatment. ",5.0

" There's so much to be said for Foundation. We start out with the psychohistorians with their leader Hari Seldon who has predicted a 10000 year Empire is about to crash to its knees and herald in a new Dark Ages. Hari can't stop the Dark Ages but he can shorten it.Interestingly he creates a priest class that runs the 'nucleonics' of the Foundation its erstwhile goal of creating an Encyclopedia Galactica set aside by stemming the tide of losing technology.You see the Empire is losing its grip on the other sectors of the galaxy. More and more are dividing and becoming their own little kingdoms. The book centers around several characters who through inside and cleverness make things happen to keep the Foundation and create an insidious society that keeps it going.Asimov as an author I have always been impressed with. His ability to create and predict (micro-miniaturization) parodies and criticism of religion and science trade and technology is throughout the book.Near the end we find that The Foundation is set to expand. Each chapter stands on its own and can be difficult for some to follow. But each chapter expands decades some more and as such can be hard to keep up.Highly recommended.

I find this satisfying in a way similar to the Dune series but I didn't have to read 6 books.As with every Asimov book I've read the plots in this book are forged and hewn into complicated machines that are disassembled before your eyes at just the right climactic moment. It makes for a hard book to put down. ",5.0
" The Foundation is a series of books about two Foundations at the end of the Galaxy at the rotting fringes of the Galactic Empire. Psychohistorian Hari Seldon has predicted the fall of the Galactic Empire and 30000 years of barbarism that will follow. The Foundations are established at two opposite edges of the Galaxy little settlements that contain all human knowledge. The problem is that there are certain crises that the Foundations must overcome with as little guidence from Seldon as possible.This was the first Asimov book I've ever read so I didn't know really what to expect. I found I loved it! It was full of interesting characters and each novelette showed a different point of time in the Foundation so instead of slowly going through each year in the 1000 years of barbarism you actually get somewhere. The characters had pros and cons to them and seemed well rounded. It also showed a change in character through time such as characters that were once sharp become dull and characters that used to rebel fall in line. Instead of telling you all about the character on the first page it gave a general idea and then let the story tell the characters. One part I really liked was that it had plot twists that I didn't see coming and the plot wasn't completely transparent.In the end this book was a very interesting sci-fi novel that kept me going and held my interest until the end.

" I realize that it is a fairly arrogant thing to think that I have something new to say about this classic work that the 335 people who reviewed it before me haven't said already so if you are reading this you must REALLY be interested in this series.The only reason I'm bothering is because I tend to write personal reviews with personal musings a habit which has cost me more than a few 'helpful' votes here and there.My purpose here (really) is to be a sort of compass for people especially newer SF fans who are just learning about the genre.If you are a member of this group then you need to ask yourself a question.

" Comes this novel given to me on Christmas by my dad on the recomendation of one of his co-workers. I am not a big science fiction fan not that I've read dozens of sci-fi books and hated them. It's just that besides what I run into in the occasional Koontz or King I have little interest in sci-fi.So after Christmas a month or so goes by and I finally open 'Foundation'. Doing research before reading this I am quite impressed at how popular this series is. After reading the book I clearly see why. The first few pages took a re-read as I was very confused. Before I knew it im onto part 2 and not able to put this book down. All I can say now is I can't wait to get my hands on the rest of the series. I was in the mood for something different than my usual reading and this really delivered. Asimov writing is intelligent yet simple. His character's aren't deep but the plot amazes. His imagination is amazing.What I especially enjoy about this book is that each of the five parts takes place many years after the previous part so you really feel as if you know the whole empire's history.All in all this book took me from not caring much for sci-fi to at the bare minimum reading the rest of this series and eventualy probably reading alot if not all of Asimov's work. A book that's on the short side never contained so much in opinion. I am now an Isaac Asimov fan. Recommended HIGHLY! ",5.0
" Foundation is a great book to read. The Foundation trilogy is a great series to read. That being said there are little elements within the story that date some of the points of reference Asimov ascribes to his characters but it's actually charming to read the references to 'atomics' etc. Asimov is a master at story-telling and this series certainly helped to cement his reputation.

" I'd like to begin this review by saying that I typically don't particularly like most science fiction. In fact I hate most of it. What Asimov did here was create an outline of continuity that seamlessly followed a logical progression displayed memorable characters that begin and end as heroic figures and never once does he insult the intelligence of the reader.The primary difference between Asimov and the Sci-Fi writers that I loathe so much is that Isaac does not stoop to create melodrama; he doesn't exaggerate his descriptions or dialogue in order to convince the reader that the heroes are great rather he let's their actions demonstrate their greatness.The only thing that does bother me about Asimov is how many terrible authors who have clearly attempted to emulate his ideas and writing style only to create abominations of thought and literature. I'm looking at you L.R.H. ",5.0

If I had to be stranded on a generational space voyage and could only bring one book this would be it.The grand scheme of this is so vast it's difficult to translate. But let's say that it encompasses a future history spanning tens of thousands of years at it's most crucial time - when the very fabric of its society is about to plunge into a dark age. Only one man can save it Hari Seldon by writing an Encyclopedia Galactica that will redirect the knowledge of mankind into a small group of scientists who can rebuild humanity in just a few thousand years.Epic in proprtion brilliant in detail this is a must read for anyone who not only savors the salt of Sci-fi literatue but anyone who just wants to read the best of the best of any genre.

" In my humble opinion this is the best Foundation book and the best overall novel that Asimov ever wrote. It's a work of genius! There are two sections of the book. The first is a seemingly typical war story of the conflict between the Galactic Empire led by a strong emporer and a firebrand general and the dumb-luck mediocre leadership of the Foundation. It illustrates how under the Seldon plan it is virtually impossible to defeat the Foundation. The second part is just phenomenal. Word spreads of a mighty mutant the Mule who is conquering the galaxy with unprecedented mental powers. The Foundation is astonished when they don't beat him;the Mule is the .001% that the Seldon plan left room for and dismissed. The Foundation falls and only a small group of hopefulls dare to go to the library of Trantor to find the Second Foundation and defeat the Mule. This book has it all;plot twists philosophy and colorful memorable characters. I highly recommend it. ",5.0

" Foundation was by far one of the best science fiction novels I have read. I especially loved his take on religion and actually making a parody of it! Through the Foundation's organized religion Asimov showed how science can possibly and really be equated with a new religion or a set of superstitions and preternatural phenomenon. Asimov also showed how religion can sway the minds of the masses as the subjucation of the Four Kingdoms illustrated. Asimov wrote his wonderful opus as a parallel of the Roman Empire and the historical allusions show. However there was something in the book that was surprisingly missing. There were no female characters! Except for the Commdora of Korell most of the figures holding real political social or economic power in this society of the future thousands of years ahead were male. I find this hard to believe. I reasoned though that because Foundation was written by Asimov in the 50s during the 'Golden Age' of SF female characters were a scarcity in most science fiction anyway. There were no female writers of SF either. Other than this glaring omission Asimov has done a brilliant job with Foundation. ",5.0
" I can see why Issaac Asimov is consider the king of science fiction. To be honest this is the first book I read by him. When I read this book I was flabbergassed that this book was written back in the early fifties. He was so ahead of his time!!! I was amazed of how much this book was mostly all dialouge usually I would of been bored if the book was mostly dialouge but the theories in this book can they be all real one day!! The thought of psychohistory should be a considered science of future and politics. Most of the books I read that are consider science fiction I feel is mostly influence by this man. I know there are more to this series but after I read this book I felt I needed much time to absorb of what I just read because it was such a mind opening experience. ",5.0

" I personally enjoyed ever word of this particular work. Many other reviewers have gone into the plot etc. so I will not do so here to any depth. This is one of those works of SiFi that will appeal to certain taste while others may find it not to their liking. There is a great deal of politics (almost Pre WWI European) involved in the story line. As the story covers (all books included) over one thousand years there are many many characters to track and keep track of. This is indeed a series of short stories all linked. I personally enjoy this sort of thing but can see where some might not. That being said it the book can certainly be regarded as a classic in this particular genre and certainly should be read by any student of such. You certainly cannot fault the author's story telling ability and imagination. I enjoyed this one a lot and do highly recommend it. ",5.0

" Unlike a lot of other sci-fi books Asimov has the ability to include not only the sense of futuristic complications and inventions he has the unrivaled ability to also include a dramatic and intense showing of personal interactions which is what makes him such a master.Its more than an idea Asimov makes it a story. Great book and possibly the best of the three foundation novels. ",5.0
" Get this book! One thing that may help is that the farsighted hero Hari Seldon sets up a plan that supposedly needs no individuals to make it work forces of humanity and all that but the stories repeatedly show the importance of individuals.

" Asimov remember wrote this initially as a series of short stories for a sci-fi magazine. Only later were the stories combined as a book. That is why of course no great character development occurs and the stories seem tidbits rather than grand scale work. Granted there is not much science in the book but I have always felt that sci-fi is a form of fiction to allow the author to write freely on a subject and be able to mask what he is really talking about. Think about it change the story to another world and have strange names for planets and suddenly nobody sees it as an attack against their country or their people. I have also felt science fiction to be more political than science (even though we call it science fiction). Politics are immense in Foundation and the style of having conversations to tell the story vs. having lots of action and space battles is fantastic. I read this first when I was 18 and did not appreciate what Asimov is trying to do. At 39 I get it. Asimov is looking at society in general and commenting that no society can be perfect and ideal and all wonderful and that dirty tricks and greed and compromise and working with others (including our enemies) is the only way a society can survive and the rest is simply propaganda. It's a direct attack against all societies that foster the idea that we're the best and the greatest and we stand for freedoms and love of country. Instead he states that what all societies become are survivors finding their strengths to counteract the enemies weaknesses. It's a great reality check which is why this should be required reading for all political science majors. ",5.0
" Asimov participated in American science fiction's golden age helping to convert pulp fantasy stories into realistic predictions of the future based on current science. It isremarkable that he wrote the Foundation while a young man barely 20 I believe a work with grand themes and the cornerstone of his massive and sprawling future history of mankind which I believe went into more than 50 volumes. The basic plot is that a scientists created a new discipline psycho-statistics I believe that could predict the future behavior of huge masses of humans. He then attempts tomold - or at least influence - man's fate over the next 30000 years. What is truly amazing is that Asimov succeeds in this and the two following volumes. In a way he should have stopped here with the series. The ideas are crisp and not yoked into a determined framework so are fresh with lively characters. Later novels in the series - the overwhelming majority - feel more stilted bound by concepts more than by a plain old good story.A sci fi classic. ",5.0
" The books in Asimov's universe are by far the best scifi to date. I enjoyed the Foundation and Robot books so much I collected all 45 books that are set in the Foundation universe written by Asimov and other authors.

Asimov is a great writer who's very prolific (He's written over 400 books! ) This is the start of his Foundation series which is a well-developed series detailing the fall of a Galactic Empire and one man's attempt to shorten the dark ages that are to come after the fall.

" I'd say that you will probably be a bit lost if you don't start with foundation and plan to continue with second foundation after this book. Reading this as a stand alone would be a bit like reading Tolkien's two towers without having started at the beginning of the series. You could probably do it and get something from the story but the beauty of the foundation series is that it is a series telling one coherent story. This book shows it's age with some of the technology it discusses but it is also vividly imaginative and full of timeless lessons. ",5.0

I am currently on second foundation the third book in the series and i am looking forward to finding out what happens next. I can't remember any other book that i've ever read that covers such a large time span in the way that this book does. Characters are introduced they play their parts and then fade into history as a new set of characters is introduced. As a fairly well read individual i would recommend these books to anyone. ",5.0
" Foundation and Empire is the second volume in Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. Originally published as two novellas Foundation and Empire the novel is made up of 'The General' and 'The Mule'.In 'The General' as the Galactic Empire crumbles General Bel Riose launches an attack on the Foundation. Although the Foundation is theoretically stronger than the Empire General Bel Riose has access to greater resources and personnel and so his attack does begin to threaten the Foundation. A Foundation citizen named Devers intercepts a communication that details the General's double dealings and attempts to escape to Trantor so that he can show the communication to the Emperor and hopefully stop the attack.'The Mule' is set roughly one hundred years after 'The General'. The Empire has crumbled Trantor has been sacked by invaders and most of the galaxy has split into barbaric factions. Due to its extensive trading routes the Foundation is now the major power in the galaxy. Until that is a new threat arises in the form of a growing army of barbarians led by a mysterious individual known as the Mule. Once it is discovered that Hari Seldon has failed to predict the existence of the Mule Foundation citizens Toran and Bayta Darell along with psychologist Ebling Mis and a refugee clown named Magnifico Giganticus travel the galaxy attempting to locate the Second Foundation that had been established by Seldon.Although a much darker and more intense book Foundation and Empire is an excellent follow up to Foundation. Asimov's writing is excellent as ever with his descriptions of the alien worlds and his characterisations being particularly strong. The whole Foundation series is fantastic and Foundation and Empire is further proof that Isaac Asimov is one of the greatest science fiction writers of all time. ",5.0
" Foundation a collection of five short stories is the first book in Isaac Asimov's epic century-spanning science fiction masterwork known as the Foundation Series.The first of the collected stories 'The Psychohistorians' takes place on Trantor the capital planet of the 12000 year old Galactic Empire. Mathematician Hari Seldon has developed a new science known as psychohistory which equates are possibilities in large societies to mathematics allowing him to predict long-term outcomes. Using his psychohistory Seldon discovers that the Galactic Empire is decaying and that it will collapse within 500 years the collapse being followed by a 300000 year period of barbarism in the galaxy. When his findings are declared to be high treason Seldon and a group of hand-picked scientists agree to go into exile on the planet Terminus where they intend to create a mammoth Encyclopaedia Galactica as the repository for all human learning. In this way they hope to limit the period of chaos that will inevitably follow the collapse of the Empire.In 'The Encyclopaedists' having progressed 50 years into the future the planet Terminus is facing its first Seldon Crisis. The Foundation on Terminus is caught in the middle of a power struggle between four neighbouring planetary systems and the scientists are ill-equipped to deal with military matters. Luckily Mayor Salvor Hardin is quick to realise the danger and attempts to work out a solution. Hardin receives guidance as to the way forward for the Foundation from an image of the now deceased Hari Seldon that appears in a specially created Time Vault and confirms that psychohistory has predicted a series of crises that will occur on Terminus.'The Mayors' takes place 30 years later when the Foundation has used its scientific knowledge as the basis for a pseudo religion that keeps neighbouring planets in order. However the Prince Regent of Anacreon seeks to overthrow the Foundation and so Salvor Hardin is once again called upon to avert a Seldon Crisis.In 'The Traders' another 55 years have passed and a trader by the name of Limmar Ponyets is sent to the planet Askone to retrieve a fellow trader who is facing execution. The leaders of Askone are determined to avoid contact with and contamination by Foundation technology so Ponyets must employ devious methods to secure the release of his colleague.The final story is 'The Merchant Princes'. The Foundation has expanded and grown powerful through the use of its science religion and economics but three Foundation vessels have recently disappeared in the vicinity of Korell a civilisation trying to develop their own variety of technical superiority. Trader Hober Mallow is sent to uncover information on their technology and hopefully find the missing ships.Foundation is clearly an epic undertaking especially since anyone who reads this first book is pretty much guaranteed to want to progress on to the further books in the series but it is well worth the effort. The Foundation Series is perhaps more esoteric that Asimov's Robot Series but is still a rewarding read. The characters planets and indeed empires that Asimov has created are truly immense and his storytelling ability is outstanding. Foundation is a fantastic book by one of the greatest science fiction writers of all time. ",5.0

" Isaac Asimov is an exception author in any genre he just happens to write in science fiction. His Foundation novels are at the apex of classic science fiction.

" Asimov's Golden Age classic Foundation Trilogy is one of the early milestones of the science fiction genre. This second installment is less episodic than the first volume focusing on just two specific stories. The first volume 'Foundation' sets up the whole idea of the Seldon Plan a mathematically based view of sociopolitical forces that enables one brilliant scientist to grow a new galactic empire from a foundation of one hundred thousand scientists and their families. 'Empire' starts off in the same vein showing how the Foundation staves off annihilation at the hands of the currently decaying but still dangerous Galactic Empire. Once again the magic of this section is the subtle means by which the Foundation overcomes impossible odds and the convincing arguments Asimov uses to make the solution seem inevitable. Part Two involves an internal struggle between the Foundation's authoritarian central government and the Independent Traders who spread that government's economic power. While the Foundation is threatened with civil war the rise of a new warlord on Kalgan poses a danger to the entire human race.Because each story is substantially longer than those in Foundation this volume focuses more on individual characters. In fact it is not too much to say that a major theme is the historical question 'Do individuals matter?' As a result the characters are developed slightly more and there's even a wistful love triangle and considerably more action than was featured in the first volume which tended to be distant and impersonal. If you liked Foundation you'll surely enjoy this and the climax to the series Second Foundation.Although these books will strike many as hopelessly dated Asimov's sweeping historical vision should not be missed by any fans of speculative fiction. They have a directness and honest charm about them that is rare in contemporary science fiction. Later additions to this series both sequels and prequels don't adhere to the tone of these original novels and really add very little except bulk. ",5.0
" If you have the patience to read the first 100 pages you'll not be able to put this book aside.The first time I read this book I was 14. I've probably read it a dozen times by now.

" I had read Foundation when I was in High School and I decided to revisit the book later. Last summer I revisited the book and by the end of the summer I had read all of the books in the series. Asimov had combined 3 series into one leading to 15(?) books. I can't remember how many I read. I even checked out the Foundation books written by 'the Killer B's.' Read this book. It is a pillar of Sci-fi as is his 'I Robot.' There is a reason that these books were in contention with Tolkien for the Sci-fi series of the century. Foundation is a wonderful starting point for an engaging series.If you decide to read the 'series.' Understand that he took 3 different series his robot series foundation series and the empire series and combined them to create a vision of future history. Few authors have tried to create a series in such a grand scale and Asimov is the master of grand scale. Only the empire series (which is currently out of print) feels outdated. Yet all parts must be read to truly enjoy the second foundation trilogy.If you want to get your feet wet with Asimov start here or with his 'I Robot.' ",5.0
" Besides his Robot stories and novels Foundation stands as oneof the greatest science fiction novel written by the late IsaacAsimov.By mixing properly the future humanity and the sociopoliticaldevelopment of our race on a galactic span using the decline ofthe Roman Empire as a base Asimov tells us a story of one man'sstruggle and the product of its stubborness in following stories.This book is a must for anyone genre fan or not I guaranteeyou will read it more than once in your lifetime.

" Isaac Asimov captivates the reader in this book the 'unofficial' start to the Foundation series. The story revolves around 3 major characters Hari Seldon a famous psychohistorian and predictor of the Empire's demise Salvor Hardin mayor of Terminus home planet of the foundation and Hober Mallow a Master Trader who rises through the ranks. I found the 3 separate yet interweaving storylines appealing much like The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury but not nearly as divided. Each character has their own opinion in how to accomplish a goal and presents each in a logical and realistic way. The thing that's amazing about the Foundation is that it doesn't have to rely on epic battles hyperdetailed sensory imagery or ridiculously long monologues by static stereotypical characters. The characters are real they get afraid they make mistakes and they change throughout the story. The writting is paced just perfectly so that it doesn't tire you out yet it provides enough details about any given situation. Asimov is a literary genius and I can't recommend the whole Foundation series enough to anyone who just has a little free time on their hands. And remember 'Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent' - Salvor Hardin ",5.0

" All I can say for warm start is that Isaac Asimov is a genius. Acclaimed Hugo Award winner he really makes you feel a part of the future as he proves to be a genius not only in a robot way of thinking but also in politics economy religion mass manipulation and of course in every way that makes a human human. And I am pretty sure this characteristic of him is really connected to his also great robotics series.Imagine yourself in the future. Now imagine yourself in a further future where you are studying the chronology of the future. Remember your history classes in school? Yeah that's where he's taking you. Analyzing the Galactic Empire from a distant and omnipotent way of view he sets a pattern in the development of mankind that repeats itself various and various times that's why this book could be written set in Middle Age. But it isn't and that's one of the most fascinating things about it.Everything starts when Hari Seldon a famous psychohistorian - a new science developed by himself based in history statistics and mathematics - predicts the fall of the Galactic Empire. To save mankind from thousands years of darkness and restart he suggests setting a new colony at the fringe of the Galaxy - Terminus System - to develop the greatest literacy work of history and regroup all knowledge ever acquired",5.0
" The Foundation Trilogy is a 'trilogy' of thirteen books. This review will mainly talk about book one. The Foundation a group of scientists and engineers writing a galactic encyclopedia starts before book one takes place. The prologue is about an apparently irrelevant person. Nonetheless I think it is important to read the beginning because it sets up the story. The main story takes place much later when the actual Foundation is formed at the edge of the galaxy. This entire group of people are the main character though at time other people take the spotlight.During the book challenges arise to meet the Foundation and at each challenge the Foundation uses a different and unique method of dealing with the task at hand. As the book progresses the Foundation gets more and more technology while the empire at the center of the galaxy dies away. The Foundation was created to start a new empire after the old empire is destroyed. To make sure this would happen Harry Seldon used psychohistory to predict the future and lock the foundation in a path that will reach its goal.I think that this book should only be absorbed by people in college or beyond because it has very advanced ideas.

" Foundation And Empire by Isaac Asimov is the second book in the original Foundation trilogy which won a Hugo Award in 1965 for Best All-Time Series. It follows much the same narrative structure as the first book Foundation save that the book has only two `books' to the original's five which allows for less epic scene setting and much more character development. And don't let some of the books' critics fool you. The characterizations in these books are wonderful deep and complex. They simply are not done in the usual ways. They use a characterization style I term `silhouetting' wherein characters are portrayed not so much by what they do as the important things they do not do or that which is not described in `on stage' actions. This book though is not merely a continuation of the first book but an expansion of its themes which includes some more detailed characterization.The first book set up the history of a senescent galactic Empire on the verge of tottering into oblivion and thirty thousand years of barbarism. A scientist named Hari Seldon attempts to shorten that Imperial interregnum by establishing two Foundations on either end of the galaxy ostensibly to compile an Encyclopedia Galactica. In reality these two Foundations will be the cornerstones of the Second Empire which Seldon's Psychohistory- a deterministic pseudoscience predicts will cut the interregnum down to s ingle millennium. By the first book's end the first Foundation on the planet Terminus has survived several `Seldon Crises' via his holographic intervention which helps the Foundation outwit its enemies and the work of legendary leaders- Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow and a few centuries in to its existence seems poised to actually take on and destroy the ruined Empire.This is where Foundation And Empire starts....the book is relatively easy to get into- even if you've not read the first book. That's because Asimov's style of the pseudo historical work allows for quick recaps (in the old movie serial vein) and the fact that each chapter within each book has new characters and situations means that they can stand alone even as they add to the overall tapestry. Asimov also makes a wise dramatic choice in The Mule section. By spending a book and a half showing Psychohistory's upside and proving its internal `validity' the second half of Foundation And Empire shows the downside of lulling oneself into a false sense of security as well the consequences that coyuld await the Foundation if it falls the same way the Empire did. The funereal descriptions of Trantor contrast vividly with the awesome complexity that opens the first book of the trilogy. Then the Empire seemed impervious. Yet Asimov is so good a writer that he rarely lapses into caricature. Even The Mule is sympathetic when we understand his drive to prove himself. Even more interesting is that he seems no worse than the old Emperors nor even the dynastic heirs of the current Foundation. With his powers his Second Empire might even be better than the Seldonian one. Yet lacking an heir- due to his sterility. and his own powers it would seem likely that even greater chaos would befall the galaxy upon his death.This begs the question that seems to be central to the trilogy",5.0
" Asimov's Foundation books are well-crafted masterfully imagined and peopled with fascinating characters. Spanning some several thousand years and multiple generations of characters (often more than one per book) the author does a fantastic job keeping each set unique and captivating. The stories follow the progression of Psychohistory a technique for predicting the future behavior of masses of people and the people set up to use its information to further the birth of a greater galactic empire. Space battles intrigue mutants telepathy and mind control as well as personal triumphs and failures run throughout all the novels.

It's touching the other person's mind.There are enough circles within circles things that aren't what they seem to be surprises that put the theories into a cocked hat to keep you on your toes.Don't deprive yourself of the best sci fi series ever written.

The only minor critique I have of this book is that as a series of novellas that continually advance into the future characters you have grown to care about are quickly whisked away and replaced by new ones. Therefore it is helpful to approach this book as a set of separate though interconnected stories. When all is said and done this book sets the stage for one of the greatest sci-fi series of all time. Complete with larger-than-life characters unforgettable twists and suprises this book is sure to satisfy any who have an interest in science fiction. Highly recommended. ",5.0

" 'Foundation' is a must. Even if your taste is for other styles Asimov's 'future history' has rightly become part of the science fiction canon of great books.The first episode in 'Foundation' appeared about 50 years ago as a stand-alone story in Astounding Science Fiction under the title 'Bridle and Saddle.' At the time Asimov had no idea where it would eventually lead. Hari Seldon Salvor Hardin and the Galactic Empire emerged in that single story to shape all the 'Foundation' novels that were to follow. It's all the more remarkable then to read that story today with the realization that none of the sequels or 'prequels' had yet been thought of.The original 'Foundation' trilogy is written in a style that may seem quaint or even prim in comparison to the baroque convolutions found in some novels of the '90s. And at the time one reviewer had trouble with the episodicity",5.0
" Although Asimov's Foundation Trilogy is over 40 years old his overall writing is still top notch. There's just something about it that draws you in and then you can't put the book down. Unfortunately many people get unhappy when they read this first book alone. Because it was written originally as a magazine serial it sometimes has a choppy format. But as a whole its superb. Only after reading all three one can appreciate the magnitude of Asimov's work. There is simply not a sci-fi trilogy anywhere that can compete. ",5.0

" This book is my favorite book. It is very well writen and it pulled me in. It wasn't quite as gripping as some other books but after I read it the first time (and every time after) I felt changed.

" Foundation and Empire is the second book in this series. If you have not read the first one yet you should. Still because of the rare and very clear writing found here you can read this book and never be confused. Since both books are so good why skip the first one?In this book we return to the future. A small empire the Foundation is on the edges of a greater one. The 'Empire' currently encompasses thousands of worlds. Still compared to its past it has been shrinking. One of its most able generals aware that the Empire is less then it once was decides to expand the Empire. Unfortunately for the Foundation he has choosen the systems occured by it as the best direction for his expansion.Like the first installation this book continually talks about the 'inevitable' victory of the Foundation. Since they are being systematically destroyed by the Empire such predictions ring hollow. How the book solves this problem seems to make sense. But this war is only the prelude for a greater conflict - a Civil War in the Foundation itself.Here is a really interesting dilemena. Since the Foundation is 'fated' to survive what will happen if it wars with itself? And to make things more interesting a third party joins the conflict. This mysterious entity the 'Mule' leads forces that beats both foundations back. What is happening here?Again like the first book in this series Foundation and Empire is as much a mystery story as science fiction. How the author solves these problems are great fun. The ending actually the middle of the book is a great surprise on your first read. What happens afterwards and the new developments make for a great twist to this story and a powerful new development in this series. A great story. It is great fun and easily as enjoyable as the first book which on its own was a classic. Read and enjoy. ",5.0
" 'The Foundation' by Isaac Asimov is a very thrilling science fiction book. This book takes place so far into the future that they do not know which planet humans came from! This book spans over 160 years and shows the developments of the Foundation. The Foundation is a group of people sent to a remote planet to preserve information and to secretly start a new empire. When the old Galactic Empire begins to crumble Hari Seldon starts the Foundation. He and his followers work on an encyclopedia to help shorten the barbarian age that results from the destruction of the empire. Seldon's true plan for the Foundation is to raise the next empire that would control the galaxy. As the book continues the Foundation grows and tries to spread their beliefs across the galaxy. Powerful neighbors become jealous and try to conquer the foundation and destroy it. The Foundation wins usually using non violent means unlike their violent foes. When the Foundation starts to conquer the other surrounding worlds they expand and send out traders. Traders hold the Foundation together and keep up the economy by trading with the inhabitants and bringing them the Foundation's beliefs. Much of the galaxy is unaware of the Foundation's secrets and the power it holds! This book is divided into five sections starting at different time periods with new characters and conflicts. The beginning of each section is difficult until you learn the new characters. However the books flows well since the ideas of people in the past sections are presented in each new section as historically important. Each section is exciting with descriptive characters and a suspenseful plot. The book is a fast read written for pure enjoyment and entertainment. It does a terrific job of both. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good book. ",5.0
" The Foundation novels of Isaac Asimov are the standard by which I judge all science fiction. The stories center around the mathmatical mechanics that allow for the prediction of the future in a statistcal manner- individual lives remain unaffected but humanity's future can be charted and directed. All this comes to pass as the great galatic empire slowly but surely fades into chaos. Only Hari Seldon creator of this science of prediction can save the universe from a galatic dark age. The short stories contained in this volume set the stage for the rich universe that the other volumes fill and explore. This is the series that testifies to the genius of it's author and is perhaps his greatest legacy. ",5.0
" The Galactic Empire is crumbling and only one man can save the universe from chaos. That man is mathematician and historian Hari Seldon. To minimize the effects of the fall of the Empire he sets up the Foundation a group of people following his carefully laid plan to preserve the achievements of humanity. So begins the reader's journey through hundreds of years of history and turmoil watching as Asimov paints his picture of the tiny Foundation and its struggle to keep Seldon's plan alive. Asimov's characters are first-rate grabbing the reader's interest with their intelligence and charisma. The plot is solid and fascinating to watch as it unfolds taking twists and turns every one guaranteed to surprise. Originally published as four short stories Foundation is the beginning of the classic science fiction epic and is not to be missed by any sci-fi fan. ",5.0
" Foundation is a must buy by writing this Asimov opened a gateway for other science fiction writers none in my opinion who have been able to better him yet. Issic Asimov doesn't just give you one set time period but 5 jumping 50 years or so into the future each one with rebelious and revolutionary characters adding colour and flavour to a already brilliant plot. If this wasn't enough and the books well worth reading for just for that you are introduced to a new kind of warfare- giving the enermy something that they want and become dependent on then when they become too mencing.... well you can read it for yourself. Foundation is pure genious you MUST read this book ",5.0
" Foundation has been called by science-fiction lovers all over the world as a cornerstone for science fiction. Isaac Asimov's all time best this book tells the tale of the crumbling of the Galactic Empire and is only the beggining of a 7-book series. The way Asimov uses the analogy of the Fall of the Roman Empire has pleased readers for decades. Asimov tells the story of a planet alone at the edge of the galaxy awaiting a future already planned for it. Leaders struggle for the planets survival for this planet Terminus holds the future of the Human Race in its hands. Isaac Asimov tells the thrilling tale of human survival in an environment that is against it. ",5.0
" It had been quite some time since I had read Asimov so I was relatively excited when I picked up Foundation. I was not disappointed in the least. This novel is an absolutely fabulous piece of psycho-political drama that is perhaps most enjoyable because of its suspenseful trill as well as its political/sociological considerations.The entire text built on the theories of the fictional character Hari Seldon is driven by the concept of psycho-history. This is primarily a form of mathematical sociology that allows for the statistical prediction of galactic masses given a set of variables. As the Galactic Empire is beginning to crumble Hari Seldon perceives this fall and takes the precautions to insure a quick return to a Second Empire. The development of his Plan spurs him to create two foundations at the ends of the galaxy to promote this return.This text chronicles the early founding and rise of the first foundation. Given the nature of psychohistory most events unfold in such a way that a critical moment at which the probability of success is nearly 100% always arrives for solutions to the problems facing the foundation. This drives the story in a suspenseful manner as Asimov pursues the interrelation of individual freedom and the 'mob psychology' of psychohistory. The text is also an interesting exploration into the rise of power by a means of a variety of factors concealed in this review for the sake of not spoiling the story.Foundation deserves the accolades of the Sci-Fi community and truly should be read by anybody who has any latent interest in science fiction or fantasy. It is an exciting and fulfilling read. ",5.0

" I first tried reading this book when I was 11. For me at the time it seemed boring at that age and I had trouble reading it. Next year I picked up the book again and couldn't stop reading it. Asimov sets up a realistic structure for how to contain millenias of combined information from across a galaxy and build a stable remote world to contain the falling Empire's scientific knowledge. But especially after reading the entire series I always must ask is psycho history scientifically possible? It states that the actions of an individual doesn't affect the flow of the universe. Later int he series though you will learn of the mule that broke this rule and even later after the trilogy where he came from. But how could mathematics and the general pschology of peoplepossibly predict when specific crisis's happen. Even though in Second Foundation where the reader learns more about the second foundation which is based not on science but on pschohistory helps maintain the course of the Foundation. You can get lost in thought trying to discover the possibilities psychohistory could bring if it could work.???? ",5.0
" It is astonishing to realize that science fiction consisted of a relative humble portion of Isaac Asimov's ouevre. While most of his time was spent on nonfiction work his contributions to science fiction proved so monumental that there is not a single science-fiction writer today who has not been influenced in some way by Asimov's writing. His intellectual and engaging fiction has produced some of the finest short stories and novels in the genre in classics such as 'The Last Question' and 'Nightfall'. But his seminal work is the top-of-the-pyramid groundbreaking and famous 'Foundation Trilogy'. He is to SF what Tolkien is for Fantasy.'Foundation' is an entertaining piece of sociopolitical SF in the backdrop of a space opera. This book is the foundation of SF for the past six decades. Asimov's prose is clear and concise without any room for ambiguity or vain style. Asimov's words though pared down and stripped of subtext are not any less true or beautiful or witty.Set thousands of years in the future after humanity has colonized millions of planets in our galaxy 'Foundation' introduces the Galactic Empire is in its waning years. One man on the capital planet of Trantor Hari Seldon predicts the cataclysmic and chaotic decline and fall of the Empire. Seldon has developed the science of psychohistory which aims to calculate the behaviour of mass populations over the course of events using among other things socioeconomic trends. Seldon has predetermined not only the demise of the Empire but that thirty millennia of barbarism will follow unless his organization the Foundation is able to finish its gargantuan mission of cataloguing and preserving all accumulated human knowledge and history. The act would serve to lessen an inevitable thirty-thousand years to a mere thousand.Asimov portrays the epic grandeur of the galaxy through the unyielding arc of time and history. Individual lives are ineffectual though not inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. Throughout the stories there is a pervading sense of `greater good' or `the bigger picture'. There is only one recurring character in each of the five tales",5.0

" Asimov's Foundation books are well-crafted masterfully imagined and peopled with fascinating characters. Spanning some several thousand years and multiple generations of characters (often more than one per book) the author does a fantastic job keeping each set unique and captivating. The stories follow the progression of Psychohistory a technique for predicting the future behavior of masses of people and the people set up to use its information to further the birth of a greater galactic empire. Space battles intrigue mutants telepathy and mind control as well as personal triumphs and failures run throughout all the novels. They are in my opinion among the best crafted series in the sci-fi genre ever produced. ",5.0
" Ah Isaac Asimov. A god some would say in the sci-fi genre. I picked up this book at the urging of a friend trusting in its reputation.At first I found Foundation unusual to read it covers large swathes of time at once. However Asimov does this extremely well. He gives us little anchors of information or characters that we can recognize so we can figure out where we are in the time line without him having to come out and say it.Much of the book is dialogue which is something I have not encountered before. Most of the story and characterization is carried in the dialogue rather than through plain description. Asimov doesn't tell you what the characters are thinking he *shows* you what they're thinking as they explain it to other characters. This rather prevents us from growing too close to the characters but that is rather the point because the time line goes so fast.Foundation was an unusual novel but I can see why it is still a classic. It may be a little dry for some but I enjoyed it. ",5.0
" When you foretell the decline of a galactic empire you don't make many friends. But Seldon manages to keep what he finds low key and sets into motion a series of events that will lessen not stop the ravages that are to come.A great sci-fi classic. One of the best from an all time master of the genre. When I was younger I tried to track down every book he ever wrote. Think I got all the Tales from the Black Widows but am not sure.Any lover of Sci-fi will find this not only exciting but intelectually stimimulating. ",5.0
" I totally liked the pattern that Isaac Asimov established in 'Foundation' the first volume in what we know refer to as the original Foundation trilogy. Hari Seldon created the revolutionary science of psychohistory and mapped out a future for humanity that would allow thirty thousand years of barbarism between the existing galactic empire and the future one to be reduced to only one thousand years. Through the effort of the psychohistorians the Foundation was established with its encyclopedists. Then we saw the rise of the Mayors the Traders and the Merchant Princes each representing a step on the path laid out with mathematical precision by Hari Seldon over the first two centuries of the millennium he plotted out.I was looking forward to a continuing series of Seldon Crises as the Foundation played out the rise of human civilization thinking that what we had hear with what Arnold Toynbee had done with his study of ancient civilizations extended into a future that covered an entire galaxy. But Asimov was setting us up for something unexpected in 'Foundation and Empire'; the idea was that at this stage the Foundation would be threatened by the final power play of the dying Empire. But the universe is apparently tired of Hari Seldon playing with his mathematically loaded dice and has thrown the entire plan into doubt by creating a mutant nicknamed 'The Mule.' Now the Foundation the Seldon Plan and the entire galaxy is facing a new and powerful threat.When I first read 'Foundation and Empire' I was rather dismayed at the big change in direction. But of course Asimov knew what he was doing. He had already proven the validity of psychohistory at least within the context of his futuristic novel and there really is no reason to put out another four books (at two hundred years apiece) to complete the plan. Historians might find this interesting but Science Fiction fans were going to want more than that from Asimov. Indeed the Mule proves to be both in terms of the story and the trilogy the link between the Foundation and the Second Foundation. The Foundation trilogy is classic science fiction from the genre's self-proclaimed Golden Age and even if the writing style seems dated or quaint it remains a seminal series. ",5.0
" But then how could it not be when its author was the incomparable Isaac Asimov? There are of course plenty of other noteworthy works by all manner of Old Masters as well as newer authors that in my opinion at least belong next to the 'Foundation' series simply because they too are great sci-fi adventures and space opera",5.0

The whole world is tilted and new ways of thinking and doing things become possible. All our world leaders need to read science fiction with its ominous ventures into possible futures. Foundation is the story of a world set up solely as place to compile an enormous encyclopedia an effort for the ages. But as the story moves forward rapidly in time we readers come to see that the world has been set up for many other secret purposes purposes designed to save the thinking peoples from an eternity in a dark age.

" Asmiov is not at all a great writer. He does not develops the characters who are often just tools to set the story going. Classic readers may find his style too crude too objective. In this series a character you find important for the story in one chapter may never appear in the rest of the saga.But Asimov is a master storyteller. His imagination has delivered us a lot of great sci-fi stories and the Foundation series is among the best.In the far future experts in the study of the behavior of great populations determine that the galactic empire is going to disappear and then they conceive a plan to preserve human civilization and reduce a many thousand years of 'dark age' to just one thousand years. They predict what is going to happen decades and centuries in the future and take precautions so that humanity will be able to avoid each crisis according to the strongest factor at each time. It seems complex but it's not. As long as you reach chapter three you're ok. I can't tell anymore without spoiling it but despite its lack of literary quality it's a story you must read if you like science fiction.I liked this book most for the outstanding way the plan comes together in each crisis revealing Asimov's amazing creative mind.I you think sci-fi silly or if you value literary virtue a great deal this is not your book. But if a great story is enough to entertain you you won't be able to put this book down. ",5.0

" I'd been hearing about Asimov's work for a while now and being a sci-fi/fnatasy fan I figured I should check it out. For me it's a matter of seeing where the genre has come from and where it's going. 'Foundation' was a quick worthwhile read which much like Tolkein helped define a genre. After reading I see why Asimov is still relevant today. His stories don't age because the lessons can still be applied to modern empires and the struggles they face.**Spoiler Alert** Do not read below here if you don't want details of the story.'Foundation' certainly didn't disappoint. At first I thought it was a little odd that the sections of the book were so far apart in time but as I kept reading it began to make sense. Asimov wasn't trying to tell a story about specific characters as we're used to thinking of them (i.e. individual people) rather he was aiming to tell the story of a civilization. As I read it began to make perfect sense. His premise is that the actions of humans as a race can be predicted on a large scale. In order to get that across the story had to be told using large scale and long time periods. Whether Asmiov was thinking of this or not I can't say. But it works. ",5.0
" Isaac Asimov didn't write about aliens or alien life it seemed. Or not very much. But he did develop a Galaxy populated by humans in this start to the series.

But there is a wild card involved in the Mule a mutant with powers to control minds and change the course of the history plotted by the scientists.

" It's kind of funny when i think that less than 3 months ago i had never heard os Isaac Asimov and i had not much interest in reading science fiction. Then i get some book called 'Foundation' for christmas and it kind of interested me although i didn't read for over a month after i had it.Well since then not only have i read it and not only have i done alot of research on Asimov and science fiction in general but i've also bought and read 'Foundation and Empire'. Quite a difference one book can make.I can not get enough of Asimov's Foundation series. I own over 100 books that i've found at thrift stores and second hand stores by many different authors. However the second day that i owned 'Foundation and Empire' i dove right into it and it did not dissapoint. The only negative thing i can say is that it's just barely not as good as the first book (although that book really blew my mind and was my very first sf novel).Regardless 'Foundation and Empire' is another solid tale by Asimov filled again with great characters (even a clown!) and written with top notch imagination and imagery. Particularly amazing is how Asimov created the character of Hari Seldon. He appears in this book for about two pages and yet the man's presence is a highlight. I did question if Asimov wasn't skilled at creating solid character's with real depth. However when a man who was only in 40 or 50 pages of the first book makes an appearance in this one it was easily my most anxious moment of the story and i truly felt just as eager as everyone else sitting before the vault for Seldon to appear. Consider my question withdrawn haha.I am really loving the Foundation series just the whole creation of the many planets the talk of ships the different classes of people everything! Not only am i very antsy about continuing this series (which i will definitely be doing soon) i am dying to read his robot novels and his stand-alones as well. Great book! ",5.0

" The big brain of Isaac Asimov composed this series and it shows. This book contains more characters than a fifteen-act Shakespearian play and still manages to unfold as one impressively coherent space-saga. This is by no means a detriment and characters as well as past events are periodically referenced in later chapters.I'm by no stretch a science fiction aficionado but upon reading summaries of the plot I couldn't wait to read this book and it verily meets my expectations. The most interesting thing about this work is that it can be read as pure-science fiction or as social-commentary/social history. Without revealing too much the sections of the book are dedicated to describing certain 'Crises' that invariably occur due to the events of an imperialistic planet - planet Terminus home-world of the Foundation - and it's attempts to reestablish (or supplant) a dying Galactic empire. The Foundation uses religion politics and economics to spread it's influence across the periphery or 'outer-edge' of the galaxy. Most of the book centers on characters who possess an aptitude for politics or are just plain cunning and it's extremely entertaining to see how each character handles the crises and mini-crises laid before them.This book is surprisingly heavy on politics - but not politics as usual...that is to say not any politics that you and I would be familiar with but politics of fictional worlds and fictional people. However the political theory behind it all is strong...I was hoping for a little more description when it came to the actual 'science-fiction' but I guess it was Asimov's intention to leave most of the work to the imagination and this actually works-out beautifully. Your imagination can truly run wild with this book - Asimov gives only the most cursory descriptions of the characters but what he gives is enough to get you going. Besides who wants to spend time reading about a character when there is a good chance that he or she will no longer exist a couple pages down the road? You can infer much of the characters content from their actions and dialogue. Foundation is an entertaining and ambitious book and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series. Classic for a reason.

" This book Foundation is a very detailed fictional book that place in the future. Isaac Asimov wrote many books and series in his lifetime and this book along with the series was one of his first books written. This story is mostly about the First Galactic Empire and its fall. Hari Seldon was a psychohistorian and using his advanced mathematics was able to conclude that the Empire would soon fall in 500 years and then be followed by 30000 years of barbarism. Hari however could limit the 30000 years to only 1000 years by having the people on a planet called Terminus follow an Encyclopedia Galactica that Hari Seldon had made. They followed this for 50 years until they found out it was a fake. Many years pass and there are many different people who try to do something to help. Each person had a crisis to get past in order to keep doing what had to be done to limit the barbarism to 1000 years. This continues until the end of the book and is then continued in the sequels. I think that this book was very interesting and I enjoyed it a lot but the only problem about it is that it is very difficult to follow because each chapter new characters are brought in and it take place 50 or more years later in time. Other than that if you are a good reader and enjoy fiction books then this is a great book to read.

" Few works of literature merit me acquiring several copies and I must say that the Foundation series is one of those.

" This is the first book of the original trilogy but the third book overall. Here's a list of all the books in the Isaac Asimov series.- Prequels -1.Prelude to Foundation (Foundation Novels)2.Forward the Foundation (Foundation Novels)- The Original Trilogy -3. Foundation4.Foundation and Empire (Foundation Novels)5.Second Foundation (Foundation Novels)- Later Works -6.Foundation's Edge (Foundation Novels)7.Foundation and EarthThere are other books written by other authors called the Second Foundation Trilogy but I haven't read those (and don't plan to).The plot centers around a psychohistorian named Hari Seldon who can predict the future using his newly invented science. He realized that the empire is failing and the galaxy will be propelled into a 30000 year stretch of barbarism before a civilized government is established. To reduce the time to a mere 1000 years he establishes two Foundations at each end of the galaxy.This book focuses on only the First Foundation the Second Foundation makes its first appearance in the sequel Foundation and Empire. The First Foundation expands to take over the edges of the receding empire using its superior intelligence instead of force. They win conflicts through technology religion and trade.The theme that reason can overcome brute force is cleverly illustrated in this science fiction classic. It's a relatively short book at 320 pages and a very fast read. The first book of the original Foundation trilogy is the beginning of a truly great series a must read for any sci-fi fan. ",5.0
" I can't say enough about this book weather you like SF or not this book is a MUST READ!!! It's more about people/civilizations/political systems than SF but either way I highly recommend it.As for SF it is simply the best SF book ever written!!!! ",5.0
" I won't bother you with much detail about the book just know that this is one of the best (if not THE BEST) Science Fiction books I have ever read. I highly recommend this book to everyone. If you plan to read only one Sci-Fi book in your entire life please make it this one! Asimov pretty much established the grounds for all space odysseys' that followed (think Star Wars Star Trek Hitchhiker's Guide etc.). You wont be let down.The book is actually a collection of 5 short stories published together in one volume. It all begins at about 30000 years after our time and about 12000 years after the Galactic Empire was established. Hari Seldon a brilliant mathematician has developed a theory (psychohistory) that can accurately foretell the behavior of immense human populations to the tee. Using it he placed the Empire's demise at 300 years with an added bonus of 30000 years of struggle in a chaotic and barbaric galaxy until the Second Empire is established.What are you waiting forget yourself a copy!!!

" Foundation is a masterpiece bar none. It is not only great science fiction but great fiction. Asimov does a truly wondrous job of painting a large picture much in the way that the Hudson School of painting did in the 19th Century while also giving compelling characterization like a Rembrandt and selecting the `right' moments that the reader can zoom in on in this compelling account of future history. Asimov leaves Clarke in the dust in terms of characterization and most of this is achieved via dialogue while still painting a big picture. Asimov wrote wonderful dialogue and one can read the tenor of a character's soul simply by how they react in words to other characters. That said I am very surprised that Asimov did not take issue with George Lucas's Star Wars films because without Foundation there would simply not be Star Wars. Everything is there to be plumbed and looted- a galactic Empire rebels space jumps to circumvent the speed of light the Galactic Spirit (aka The Force) and so on. Even Star Trek took a heavy load of its mythos from this book as the human dominated Federation and human-looking and human-derived aliens that dominate most of the Star Trek universe have much akin with the Empire that rules Foundation at novel's start....Foundation was first published in novel form in 1951 but consisted of a number of short stories published throughout the 1940s in magazines like John W. Campbell's Astounding Science Fiction. Book One The Psychohistorians was written specifically as an opening for the novel; Book Two The Encyclopedists was published as Foundation; Book Three The Mayors was published as Bridle And Saddle; Book Four The Traders was published as The Wedge; and Book Five The Merchant Princes was published as The Big And The Little. Each of the Books within the novel functions almost as an autonomus story much the way Bradbury's Martian Chronicles or Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg Ohio do. Yet it all ties together and though it has always had a reputation as a space opera even if the ultimate or original space opera it transcends that label. Yet those sorts of labels can be offputting to casual readers of a genre like I am. For I am not a sci fi nut by any means yet I sense that many people have avoided this book because like say reading a Rilke poem or watching Orson Welles' Citizen Kane they have felt that something so overpraised and hyped is bound to be a letdown. It's not. It earns its praise and labels like epic for even though the book is less than 150 pages long in my version probably 250-300 pages in paperback it is certainly epic- the timescales and range of the Empire demand nothing less. And although that term is grossly overused in this case it is spot on. The very title of the book has in the decades since its first appearance taken on another connotation though- that of not only referring to the Foundation within the tale but its place as the Foundation upon which modern outer space sci fi is based upon.This is not to deny the books flaws which are there. But given that most of them have to do with technological things they are not truly literary flaws merely those of the nature of the sci fi genre. Among them are anachronisms such as typical hausfrau-like portrayals of women who apparently still worry over household domestic products an addiction to nicotine an over-reliance on atomic power the use of parsecs rather than light years as a unit of distance the galactic Empire being at the center of the galaxy where we now know only a supermassive black hole exists and makes life as we know it untenable due to radiation and other minor points. Other flaws are less anachronistic than what in film would be called continuity errors such as being able to transcend the speed of light but recording information in actual books and on microfilm rather than digitally or quantumly yet being able to teleport that information; the Empire possessing holographic technology yet it all being powered by vacuum tubes; or civilizations possessing interstellar ships but having economies dependent on fossil fuels- which means that dinosaurs and the like must have appeared on millions of the other worlds. Then there are just the plain odd things such as Asimov's faith in capitalism being the solution to the galactic ills even though in his universe it's what ails all the worlds. The idea that even were an Empire to arise and dominate a galaxy that such a massive thing could ever stagnate seems odd. Diversity argues against that but this shows Asimov's pessimism regarding the human ability to evolve. That these future men also have life spans akin to ours smoke and suffer cancer bespeaking there seems to have been little in the way of medical breakthroughs (this was pre DNA discovery) also seems a bit of an imaginative lack.But perhaps the greatest flaw of the book is Asimov's love affair with the Freudian Psychohistory (although I'm told in later books Asimov redacted the mythos to reveal it all a fraud) which reeks of determinism exalts psychology to a `hard' science damns free will plays to the Fallacy Of Uninterrupted Trends and has been totally demolished in the wake of chaos theory. Still even though Psychohistory fails as science it's still far easier for a writer to predict human nature than scientific advances.But again these are mere quibbles relatively speaking. Let me look at the pro side of the ledger. The very Psychohistory that in reality is specious allows for the very drama of the tale to exist. While poor science it makes for excellent drama. To watch the various Foundation leaders grapple with their own will versus their faith in Seldon is the essence of existentialism. Asimov's use off offstage action is not just a condensing device but clues the reader in to what is really important- the human moments and confrontations not the comic book like blowing up of great interstellar vessels. A third device that works well is the use of select epigraphs throughout the story culled from the fictive Encyclopedia Galactica. They unify the tale lend it grandeur and ground this future history as if it were already in the reader's past much as Edward Gibbons' real and influential The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire did and which Asimov acknowledged as his main source of ideas. Wisely there is not too much technobabble which helps date a work more than anything else. Also as stated before the book is rife with humor and sparkling dialogue as well as plausible catchphrases like `Galaxy knows' or `By galaxy!' It is also worth re-stressing that the book's focus is not on scientific progress but social progress and this predicates a number of major existential queries such as what is progress? How does progress reconcile with human nature? Is progress ever expanding cyclical or helical? What is knowledge? How do the two square? Should knowledge be commoditized? Should knowledge be mysticized? What is free will and ethical agency? But most of all how can all these subjects and ideas be best related?Yet most of all despite the ideas and the narrative is the wonderful fact that Asimov is just flat-out a damned good writer. His prose is sometimes muscular sometimes poetic but always lucid and clear. His plots are not overly Byzantine yet quite complex his sentence and paragraph structure not ornate but subtly seductive. How Hollywood has never optioned this book for a film is beyond me. Wait no it's not. Why would they want to do compelling human-based science fiction when they can pump out the pseudo-intellectualism of a Philip K. Dick or the vapid ur-mythography of Star Wars and make a fortune? Perhaps Asimov might be re-thinking his faith in Adam Smith's invisible hand in the great beyond? ",5.0
" The main plot of the story copies the evolution of every human society. The decline and fall of empires followed by the rise of others depends on the same phenomena as those described here. We are puzzled by Psychohistory but the notion itself (forecasting the future as the weather) is sound. This novel opens a range of questions and issues beyond other books of the genre. ",5.0
" Isaac Asimov considered his work that eventually became the Foundation and Empire book of The Foundation Trilogy to be his best due to his introduction of the misunderstood mutant conqueror",5.0
" Once again Asimov serves up a thrilling read for the sci-fi fan. The two story-lines followed in the text pertain particularly to the question of if/how spectacular individuals can alter the Plan of Hari Seldon. The first pertains to a final thrust of the Empire while the second pertains to the question of an anomalous power known as the Mule.The final expeditions of the Empire attempt to take over the foundation by means of the talented general Bel Riose. Bel Riose launches a campaign against the Foundation and pushes toward victory with nearly unprecedented ease backed by the Imperium. This first half of the book considers the power of the individual and the mass with respect to the great movements within the Foundation according to the Plan. Although I will not reveal much more than this I will at least say that the outcome of part one is intriguing in comparison to part two dealing with the Mule.The second half of the story deals with the relationship of Seldon's plan to the possibility of a mutation which begets a figure who is an extremely powerful galactic conqueror destroying the overall political milieu foresaw by Seldon. To speak much more of this would spoil the read for you. However I must say that it is a thrilling text which kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through the end. The ending itself was such a surprise that it indeed reminded me that I was reading Asimov for it is just the type of intellectual curve-ball that he would throw just as the novel ends.Once again we have a stupendous text on our hands in these two. It raises major questions about the plausibility of psycho-history some of which are raised again in the third text in the series. I suggest this text most thoroughly to all sci-fi fans. I only suggest that you at least read Foundation before reading this book. ",5.0
" But Asimov is one of the greatest science-fiction authors to have every lived. His massive work adding itself to works by other such sci-fi masters",5.0
" This book is amazing science fiction novel. Asimov's straightforward and simple way of writing presents the reader with a concise and well formed novel. The plot is amazing with its many twists and turns although the character development isn't very strong. However the lack in character development comes from Asimov's style of writing in which he presents the reader with several major characters. The entire book revolves around foreshadowing of a point in history where knowledge will be lost and barbarians will rule over an ingorant civilization. In order to shroten the period of ignorance and barbarianism Hari Seldon forms the Foundation a group of scholars on a planet at the edge of the galaxy. Asimov uses foreshadwing to great effect throughout the entire novel to form the plot. Another device well used by asimov is symbolism. One example is the Foundation which is used as a symbol for hope for the future. The symbols placed throughout the novel bring about a sense of profound revelation to the reader. Irony is also used very effectively in one instance. When the encyclopedists realize that all their work was all in vain Asimov reveals the fragility of the human intellect. He explains how the composition of human knowledge is not in one single person but is spread out throughout all of humanity and cannot be contained within one book or one set of books. ",5.0
" The trilogy is essential but since Asimov also capitalized on his own genius by writing what seems to be hundreds of lesser Foundation stories it can all get very confusing and a bit draining. This is the second book in the original trilogy so it is from a science fiction point of view essential reading. The trilogy itself comes up with two highly memorable characters Hari Seldon the psycho-historian who uses Mathematics to predict the future and establish a 'Foundation' that will limit the dark ages after the fall of the 'Empire' to a single millenium (as opposed to ten.) He reappears as a hologram at certain points in the story with more or less accurate takes on what is happening in 'History' at that point.The other very memorable character is the Mule. He represents the variable that makes predicting 'History' mathematically a tricky business at least not to mention impossible. He is a nasty totalitarian character who strangely in Asimov's hands manages to elicit some sympathy. Asimov is playing with the idea of predicting human behavior scientifically (or controlling it scientifically) but this character is also a humanistic meditation on how masses of people get overwhelmed by evil social forces like fascism and soviet communism. You can see that Asimov lived through the era of Hitler Mussolini Franco and Stalin and that these cult of personality tyrants and the submission of masses of people to their destructive and sadistic wills profoundly affected his view of human nature. Foundation and Empire seems to be an attempt to come to terms with that experience and so has something to say about the specifics of twentieth century history as well as about historical philosophy.

" The Foundation trilogy (three first books) and the Foundation series (all seven) are often regarded as the greatest set of Science Fiction literature ever produced. The Foundation series won the one-time Hugo Award for 'Best All-Time Series' in 1966. Isaac Asimov was among the world's best authors an accomplished scientist and he was also a genius with an IQ above 170 and it shows in the intelligently concocted but complex plots and narrative. There are already 331 reviews for this Science Fiction novel however I still believe I have something unqiue to contribute which is stated in my last paragraph.This book and the rest in the series take place far in the future (allegedly 50000 years) at a time when people live throughout the Galaxy. A mathematician Hari Seldon has developed a new branch of mathematics known as psychohistory. Using the law of mass action it can roughly predict the future on a large scale. Hari Seldon predicts the demise of the Galactic Empire and creates a plan to save the knowledge of the human race in a huge encyclopedia and also to shorten the barbaric period expected to follow the demise from 30000 years to 1000 years. A select people are chosen to write the Encyclopedia and to unknowingly carry out the plan to re-create the Galactic Empire. What unfolds in this book and in the books that follow is the future history of the demise and re-emergence of a Galactic Empire written as a series of adventures in a similar fashion to the Star Wars series.Even though this is arguably the greatest set of Science Fiction novels ever written I do not recommend it to those who are only mildly interested in Science Fiction. Character development is not the focus of these novels and the large amount of technical/scientific details schemes and plots can become both confusing and heavy for the unitiated Science Fiction reader. If you read this one you will feel the need to read the others which may take a long time. If you are new to Science Fiction start with something lighter and when you are hooked you can continue with this series. Also in my opinion the second and third books were better than the first.

" The Foundation Trilogy is my favorite sci-fi book series and also my favorite work by asimov. The first book in the series Foundation is concerned primarily with two concepts. The first is the concept that history repeats itself over and over again and that just as great empires fell in the past the same problems will in the future aflict empires once they become too big. And naturally after the fall of a great empire chaos ensues. The other concept this book describes is the theory that science and mathematics are capable of predicting the trends in complex systems such as large groups of people.I am going to be honest. This book was revolutionary for its time and a great many famous sci-fi writers were inspired after reading this book. I know that I personally could never look at world governments the same way after reading this book. It truly opens your eyes to tendancy of people to make the same mistakes over and over again repeating the same patterns on a large scale. And not only is this book easy to read and greatly thought-provoking it is also great fun. It uses Asimov's trademark style. Little violence even less sex but a great plot and lots of cool technology. If you take science fiction at all seriously you owe it to your self to give this book a read. ",5.0

" OK I admit it. I am totally incapable of writing an unbiased objective review of this book just as I am unable to say unbiased objective things about my first girl friend. This was the first SF novel that I read (actually I bought it for a friend and then read it before I gave it to him -- the beginning of a life-long nasty habit) when I was 14.The scope of the story is breathtaking the pace is good -- especially for Asimov who tended to be pretty wordy -- and the details engaging. Asimov wrote this as a series of connected stories for 'Astounding' magazine and this shows in the oddly repeated facts that allowed the 'zine readers to follow the plot even when they missed earlier stories. It also adds a certain pulpy flavor to the text which I think works well. SF about grand civilizations that are galactic in scope doesn't need to -- and probably shouldn't -- sound like Great Fiction. I think the gritty quick style of Asimov's pulp writing works well.One of my favorite things about the whole 'Foundation' series (you need to real all three of the originals by the way the newer ones are optional) is the way they presaged certain now-routine SF conventions. The most notable of course is the globe-encovering city/planet of Trantor most recently replicated by George Lucas in 'Star Wars",5.0

" This is the first published volume (which was originally published as four short stories in 'Astounding Science Fiction' magazine 1942-1944 with an introductory section written in 1949) of Asimov's famous trilogy which affected many later works. This trilogy which won a special Hugo Award in 1966 for the best science fiction series of all time was later expanded into further volumes by Asimov (in fact two prequels are Asimov's 'Prelude to Foundation' and 'Forward the Foundation'; after Asimov's death in 1992 other authors [for example Gregory Benford's 'Foundation's Fear' Greg Bear's 'Foundation and Chaos' and David Brin's 'Foundation's Triumph'] have contributed to the series [note that there are now five novels that serve as prequels to Asimov's first published Foundation book!]) . In these stories spacecraft travel over large distances via 'jumps.' The ships spend most of their time in a form of hyperspace each jump being aimed at a certain target star. The central character Hari Seldon is a psychohistorian. Psychohistory is the mathematics dealing with the reactions of very large masses of mankind to social and economic stimuli (and the recent advances in chaos theory in advanced mathematics lends credibility to Asimov's psychohistory). His calculations predicts an end to the Galactic Empire (an empire remarkably similar to the Roman Empire on Earth). Two Foundations are set up to ease mankind through the dark area predicted (or else the dark period will last 30000 years) and after a thousand years will join together to form a second Empire. Although Asimov's early writing style leaves much to be desired (recall this was all put together in his early 20s during World War II when he worked for the U. S. Navy and when he was finishing his graduate work at Columbia Univ.) it is still fun reading; I enjoy every time I reread it. It is particularly enjoyable in the context of the other volumes. This first published volume has five parts. In 'The Psychohistorians' an introductory tale (which begins about 46 years after the events described in 'Prelude to Foundation' and thirteen years after the events described in the last story of 'Forward the Foundation') Dr. Hari Seldon and a young colleague are arrested on the planet Trantor (the governing center of the Galactic Empire) and tried for treason. Seldon's group are to be exiled to the planet Terminus on the galactic rim where they will form a scientific refuge. Seldon also plans to set up another group somewhere else. We later learn in Part III that this other group (the Second Foundation) is located at a place known as Star's End at the other end of the galaxy. In 'The Encyclopedists' taking place about fifty years later a large number of members of the original Foundation are on the planet Terminus and are compiling a massive encyclopedia to prepare for the upcoming dark age. But why were no psychobiologists and only one psychologist present among the original colonists? The remaining three parts continue the development of the Foundation on Terminus. ",5.0

" Originally written in the 1950's for serial publication the Foundation Trilogy (and the additional books written in the series) is often hailed as Asimov's greatest achievement. Certainly the original trilogy is high on my list of 'must read' science fiction.The Foundation Trilogy presents us with a universe controlled by the Galactic Empire. The Empire has governed the known universe for tens of thousands of years and appears to be at the zenith of its power. But the Empire is burdened by the weight of the bureaucracy needed to govern millions of worlds. Trantor the administrative seat of the Empire is a planet completely covered by buildings. A vast planet-wide city it houses the millions of functionaries necessary to administer the Empire. As wealthy and as powerful as the Empire seems disaster is just around the corner. However only one man Hari Seldon is able to recognize the Empire's impending doom.Hari is a mathematician who has developed the breakthrough field of Psychohistory. Psychohistory is the mathematical process by which the actions of people can be predicted in advance. This science does not work for predicting individual behavior but instead predicts the behavior of a mass of humanity (billions of people). By analyzing the Empire with Psychohistorical methods Hari has determined that the Empire will crumble within 500 years plunging the known universe into barbarism that will prevent a new Empire from arising for 30000 years!Fortunately Hari has developed a plan that if executed will curtail the period of galactic decay to a mere 1000 years. However it is unclear whether Hari can persuade the Emperor to allow him to move forward with his plan. Can Hari and his fellow scientists save the universe? Or will the shortsighted aims of a greedy grasping Emperor derail their plans?Although these works are science fiction they would probably not be classed as 'hard' science fiction. There is some necessary discussion of scientific principles but not enough to bore any 'technophobes' who may be reading the novels. The trilogy focuses mainly on the people involved in the Seldon plan as opposed to the technology being used by them. Asimov always enjoyed speculating on how people would evolve and react to advanced technology and he lets his imagination run wild here.Two significant milestones were achieved with this work. First Asimov became one of the first writers to theorize that atomic power would revolutionize society. Second I believe Asimov was the first to present a planet that was entirely covered by buildings. The universe he creates is engaging and filled with fascinating believable characters. Since the books were serialized many chapters (especially in the first volume) contain complete plot lines and make the book easy to read if you need to break up your reading time into small increments. Lots of political intrigue and maneuvering keeps the action flowing through all three books.Foundation sets the stage for the rest of the series. Hari Seldon is introduced and his theories of Psychohistory are explained. Then Seldon's Foundation is established on Terminus a remote planet at the edge of the Empire with the goal of shortening the period of barbarism the universe will experience. However there are no Psychohistorians located in the Foundation... only scientists. The planet has very few native metals and virtually no defenses. The scientists must figure out how to rule their world and fend off avaricious neighbors as the Empire begins to crumble. The majority of this first volume contains vignettes chronicling the Foundation leaders responding to various crises that Hari Seldon predicted centuries before. The crises are varied and plausible. The solutions to the problems that arise are not solved by any miraculous means but by tough clever political maneuvering. Watching the crises and their solutions unfold is very enthralling and keeps you turning the pages at a rapid pace.There is something here for everyone to enjoy. If you have never read this fine trilogy buy a copy today. You won't be disappointed. ",5.0
" Isaac Asimov has always been a better science writer than a science fiction writer. He does not have the turn of phrase the poetic endownment the ability to have characters change and grow and become interesting...but his ideas have always been cutting edge without being over the top.The vision of the breakdown of the future empire of Hari Seldon and the school of psychohistory the idea of setting up two Foundations at each end of the galaxy...great elements of a story. There has been talk that Asimov 'borrowed' these ideas from Campbell but if so he gave them a polish and a new direction that completely transformed the otiginal ones.One must grant literary historical and scientific license to the writer in that many of the inventions we take for granted were only glimmers in the eye of a teenager in the 50's. The ideas are stunning in scope if not in execution. I would have loved to have seen a Heinlein or Pamela Sargent with this material. Still it retains the reader throughout...and sets up the next novel in the trilogy. ",5.0
" I first read the Foundation series many years ago and made the mistake of loaning the books to a friend - of course I never got them back. Recently I decided to buy the series again and once again I was amazed with how ahead of their time they were considering how long ago they were written. The central premise of the story is imaginitive and the plot devices by which Asimov drives the book forward are cleverly thought out.I'm not a fan of 'laser guns and spaceships' science fiction and I hold to the idea that people living hundreds of years from now will fundamentally be the same as us. We won't be wearing silver suits and living on a diet of vitamin pills. So it's refreshing to read a 'sci-fi' story that doesn't get bogged down with high-tech stuff but focusses on human development. I'd recommend it to any one whether you're a sci-fi geek or not. ",5.0

" Foundation is set about 12000 years in the future where the weakening grip of the galactic empire is showing strong signs of decline.Enter Hari Seldon key figure in the book whom as per his psycho-historical mathematics claims to bring 30000 years of barbarism down to a mere 1000 by setting up two foundations at the opposite ends of the galaxy. The story about the first Foundation follows and here asimov attacks typical sociological issues and how the infant society deals with them.It is more of a series of well-connected snapshots over several decades rather than a contiguos moving story/time line. The only weakness of the book if you want to call it that is the lack of good character development... but it doesnt impede the reader from following the twists and turns of the plot.Foundation is the first book in what is perhaps Sci-Fi's most imaginative and complete series by Issac Asimov. It's almost a sin to not finish the series which include (in order)foundation and empiresecond foundationfoundation's edgefoundation and earth <-- best book of the seriesTo get most thrill out of the series i highly recommend reading the robot series (the caves of steel the naked sun the robots of dawn robots and empire) before moving on to foundation's edge and foundation and earth.

" This book has flaws yes as some of the earlier reviewers have pointed out but they are seriously missing the point if they give the book fewer than 2 stars. Asimov was a man of great ideas and scientific knowledge but I do not believe that he ever took a creative writing class. He was writing back in the days when a writer wrote rather than talked about writing. So OK some of the characters talk as though they are in a cowboy movie. So OK some of the dialogic phrasings are awkward or stilted. So OK there is only one teeny tiny female character (as a black man myself I might aslo point out that we of the African Diaspora are noticeably absent from the futuristic roll call). The whole idea of psychohistory is so engaging that you sit there for hours pondering it and thinking and he was so young when he wrote this. So young. This is a great book a true classic. ",5.0
" This book along with Frank Herbert's Dune are the two cornerstones of science fiction. Many subsequent writers owe a debt to Foundation which is best read within the original trilogy (Foundation Foundation and Empire Second Foundation. It is extremely exciting for anyone with a sense of the 'epic' questions of the fate of mankind or for that matter any large society or culture. A staggering achievement.It is hard to get to the end of this work and not want to pick up Foundation and Empire.Now I might add that I did not personally enjoy very much the subsequent 'interference' with the books created by the subsequent novels - Foundations Edge Foundation and Earth and Prelude to Foundation. I think Asimov's idea for the story changed as he got older (certainly the 'robot' angle is increasingly emphasised which I think is to the general detriment of the series) and while I have not read much literary criticism on this topic I would suggest the original idea was better.

" I first read these books when I was in high school and althoughI almost never read fiction and don't particularly like sciencefiction (even though I studied geophysics in university andwork as an engineer) these books made an immense impressionon me. As I began to study Judaism I finally discovered thatAsimov a non-observant yet knowledgable Jew was using theformat of science fiction to describe the Jewish concept of theredemption of mankind. A careful reading of the BiblicalProphets shows that the ideal world that history is leadingmankind towards has universal peace between nations and ade-emphasis of technology in favor of the development of man'sinner morespiritual side. However this development of man's spiritualqualities and move towards universal harmony is accompaniedby upheavels and wars. Jewish tradition also says that theworld is sustained by 36 'hidden' righteous people whosegood deeds and spritual superiority are vital from preventingthe destructive forces in the world both natural andman-made from overcoming everything and leading the worldto chaos.Asimov used the two Foundations as his vehicle for describingthis cosmic process and an important part of the story isthe necessity of the Second Foundation to remain 'hidden' toallow the process to work itself out.As far as the story itself is concerned it is true that it isdated...for example Asimov places the capital of the GalacticEmpire on the planet Trantor which 'is at the center of theGalaxy'. Today it is believed that the center of the galaxyis full of black holes and lethal amounts of radiation so itis unlikely there would be life as we know it there. AlsoAsimov posits atomic energy as being the ultimate form of powerbut physics has advanced beyond that point to fusion and otherexotic forms of power.On the other hand Asimov wrote these stories in the wake ofthe Second World War and so he is quite aware of how so manyinstitutions created by men...including governments and religiousestablishments even starting with the bestof intentions seems to run into crises. Thus the GalacticEmpire which brought centuries of peace and prosperity tomankind is brought inevitably to a point of degeneration andhow the (First) Foundation itself founded by idealisticintelligent people who are at least partly aware of theirimportant role in shaping a better future for mankind rapidlydegenerates into a repressive dictatorship.As others have pointed out these stories have almost no 'action'which is fine with me (my favorite movies and TV shows alsohave no action e.g. Twelve Angry Men) and in spite of thefact that these stories are 60 years old I recommend themto anyone who wants a deeper look at mankind's natureand its destiny.

" Asimov was one of the incredible path-breakers for science fiction and the Foundation books are thought by many to make up one of the best and most far-reaching series of the entire genre. While Asimov was a biochemist by trade he certainly understood the circular pattern of human history regardless of the amount of technology available to mankind.Foundation is about the fall of the Galactic Empire that has ruled for times immemorial (so long in fact that the memory of the legendary 'Earth' is but a myth). The Empire's fall will obviously result in much chaos as the wheels of law struggle to beat back the inevitable barbarians who rise to loot and pillage (rather than rebuild) the riches of the old Empire. All of this seems a rather bleak future for humanity yet Asimov is a hopeless optimist (at least in my eyes) in that he sees the resilience of people as ever reaching. The Foundation series is therefore a group of novels about the ways in which humanity restores itself even after all seems lost.'Foundation' the first novel in the series focuses on a colony formed by one who foresees the destruction of the Empire a man named Hari Seldon. Seldon therefore attempts to minimize the effects of the collapse by building a community made up of intellectuals called the 'Foundation'. The book is divided into three separate stories at completely different times in the history of Seldon's paradise one at the formation of the Foundation another at its troublesome infancy and the last at the time that the Foundation becomes economically independent (it becomes internally capitalistic and externally somewhat imperialistic). Each story rather stands alone and while the last is somewhat disappointing each is worthy in its own right.Highly recommended; if you don't read this book you can't understand science fiction as a genre.

" Hari seldom the man who predicted the fall of the empire in the first book established foundations on each end of the galaxy to prevent the rise of a dark age. The fallen empire from the first part of the book has incresed it's strength and with that strength it plans to seize control of the foundation. With an ambitious and skilled general and dozens of battle fleets the foundation faces it's greatest enemy.Personally I liked the second part with the mule better then the war with the empire because the main characters have nothing to do with the foundations victory which makes the plot not a major factor for the story but this also leads the reader into more surprises for the end of the section.'I am the mule'. As the reader discovers the identity of the speaker all loose ends are tied up while creating a great twist for the end. Even though Seldon's predictions guide the foundation to overcome the first four crises this is the book where his predictions turn the foundation into a disaster. A mutant is born having the power to fight against any great power of the galaxy a man that is able to defeat dozens of battle fleets with the intelligence greater then any scientist of the foundation. .The second part of the book is full of surprises so please finish the book if you have started it or you might miss one of the best plots in science ficiton. While reading the story of the two couple's adventures the reader needs to think deeply in their every move. Isaac lets the reader feel the negative consequences in prediction. The more hope the foundation has on Hari Seldon's prediction the greater fall they will need to suffer. Although the plot of the couple's is resolved the foundations destiny is discovered in the third book the second foundation. I believe any reader that has read this book will definitely also need to read the second foundation so I recommend buying both books. ",5.0
" This is truly a defining book for the genre of science fiction. The beauty of this tale is that Asimov began penning it when he was only twenty one years old. The story centers around a falling empire and the many characters throughout its history that define it. It also deals with a sort of scientific prophecy in what is termed 'psychohistory'. This is the manner in which the future can be predicted using scientific evidence and the laws of probability. This is truly a masterpiece of the genre. A standard which all sci-fi authors should hope to attain. I would recommend this read to anyone that is a science fiction fan. Many readers are familiar with Orson Scott Card. This is the novel which prompted him to become a writer. That this novel is a cornerstone in the genre is an understatment. ",5.0
" This was the first book I have read by Isaac asimov and I can say it was worth the wait. While this book is very old it is still an excellent read. Asimov presents a very convincing future for humanity. The book is broken into several sections that were originally short stories in a sci-fi magazine. They gel togethor perfectly and the overall story is wonderful. This book details Hari Seldon and his prediction of the fall the galactic empire and the rise of barbarism for 30000 years. He however thinks he can avert the disaster and only have 3000 years of barbarism in the galaxy. Based on this he sets up two seperate foundations that are supposed so achieve this goal. This book is focused on the first foundation and it's trials as the fall of the galactic empire begins.THe characters in this book are good. While each section is short you really empathize with the characters and their lives. The plot is excellent some of the suprises he throws at you are quite extrodinary. My only complaint is some the terminology in this book is quite old and often times is quite funny to read. However the ideas characters and plot make up for the archaic wording in the book.I would recommend this book to any science fiction fan! ",5.0
" The story of Foundation continues in F&E; with the stories in this book taking us through the final fall of the old Galactic Empire and the power vacuum left in its wake. The most known aspect of the second book however is the idea that psychohistory is limited in that it is not able to predict aspects caused by wild chance-- and in this second Foundation book wild chance threatens Foundation in the person of a powerful mutant called the Mule.Well-written as Asimov always is.

" I can't believe this is finally coming to DVD!Three's Company has always been my 'all time' favorite show.I never get sick of watching John Ritter's extraordinary talent.I just hope the other seasons are released quickly.There are quite a few and I want them all! ",5.0

" Growing up I loved watching re-runs of Three's Company on TV. I think it's re-run about as long as I Love Lucy. I wasn't sure at first if I wanted to collect this series now that I had opened it up as a very lovely Christmas gift I'm a die hard fan of the series. Ever since John Ritter has passed away I've missed him very deeply possibly more than any celebrity that's passed away. Now I have a wonderful starter collection to remember him by. The quality of the DVD is totally amazing! It's one of the best that I've had besides The Mary Tyler Moore season one set. At first I've always been surprised that the first season was on one DVD. When I did some research I realized it was a starter or a test season. I love all the episodes on this set",5.0
" This package contains all six episodes from the first season of ABC's hit sitcom THREE'S COMPANY. It premiered on March 151977 starring the late John Ritter as Jack Trippera young handsome aspiring chef who was then studying the culinary arts. Joyce DeWitt is Janet Wooda brunette beauty who works in a flower shop and Suzanne Somers as blonde beauty Chrissy Snow who immediately interests Jack in many ways. Supporting cast members are the late Audra Lindley as Helen Roper and the late Norman Fell as Helen's husband Stanley. Stanley and Helen are the trio's landlords. In the first episodeJack is asleep in the bathtub following a drinking binge from a party given by Janet and Chrissy the previous evening. The party was for EleanorJack's predecessor in apartment 201. Eleanor had gotten married and given birth to a seven-pound and nine-ounce baby boy. So after Jack cooks a delicious breakfast for Janet and Chrissythey invite him to be their new roommate. When Jack introduces himself to the Roperswho live directly below the triohe tells them he's moving in. But Stanley strongly denies until Janet told him Jack was gay(Stanley could never fathom a straight male platonically living with two straight women). In episode #2Jack arrives with his belongings via taxicab from the YMCA where he previously residedto apartment 201. He rings the bellbut instead of a chime he hears Stanley reacting to the electricity immersing in him as he was fixing the doorbell. Chrissy's mother came to L.A. for a dentist's appointment and planned to stay at the apartment. She sleeps in what would become Jack's bedroom and Jack sleeps on the couch(Jack would do that whenever there were house guests). In episode #3it's Chrissy's birthday and the trio would celebrate amongst themselves. Stanley's young beautiful niece Karen is staying with the Ropers and Stanley pays Jack $50 to take her out despite Stanley believes Jack is gay. Jack promised the date would only last 20 minutes and he would come back home in time for the birthday celebration. Janet and Chrissy are furious with Jack. On the dateJack who drives Stanley's carhad some trouble with it. It overheated on the freeway. He uses the $50 to reclaim the cameo Janet had hocked a while back for rent money. Jack and Karen are kissing in the Ropers' apartment and when the Ropers awakeStanley catches Jack and Karen and immediately evicts him from apartment 201('He was acting normalthat's sick!'). The eviction is cancelled after Karenaccording to Stanleypractically attacked Jack and he showed no interest. In episode #4Jack brings home a puppyunaware that pets are forbidden in the apartment. Richard Kline as Larry Dallasmakes his first appearance on the show. Jack owed Larry $25 and Jack took the puppy to cancel the debt. Larry would later become Jack's best friend and the trio's upstairs neighbor. The trio parents the dog until Helen takes it in. A sleepwalking Chrissy planted the dog on the Ropers' doorstep. Helen declares the dog an anniversary present from Stanley. In episode #5the trio redecorate the apartment and take a break to go to the neighborhood pubthe Regal Beaglefirst seen in episode #2. Thereat the bar are two guys and one of them takes interest in Chrissy. Chrissy feels harassed by the guy. He overhears Jack telling Janet and Chrissy that men are naturally stronger than women. Hethe 'creep'finds a 'man' in the jointStanley. The 'creep' accidentally spills Stanley's brandy and asks the bartender to give Stanley another one. Later Jack finally gets tough with the creep and for his(Jack's) so-called heroismis given an on-the-house shot of whiskey. The creep harassed both Janet and Chrissy. In episode #6Janet and Chrissy are out $300 in back rent money. Thinking the money was stolenthey call the police. Jack tries to get $300 from the financial aid department at his college and is denied. Janet and Chrissy don't realize until the endthat they had already paid the rent. Stanley naturally took the moneyin an envelope with the word 'rent' on it while doing a repair job. But he failed to leave a receipt indicating he received the payment(the tenant's/s' copy was still attached to his receipt book!). ",5.0
" Yes Three's Company is the greatest show because of John Ritter's brilliance. All the seasons were great but 6 7 and 8 were easily the best because Chrissy was gone and completely forgotten and the show could now focus on the power of Jack Tripper. Sure Chrissy was a fine credit to the core of the show but as she became dumber she became more of a hindrance than a support to Jack. Terri on the other hand became the perfect complement to Jack not to mention the fact that she was also much hotter than Chrissy. And of course Janet had always achieved a wonderful dynamic with Jack throughout all the seasons. The last 3 seasons not only showcased John Ritter's unbelievable physicality in greater amounts but the actual content of the show focused on Jack's life. In other words the whole premise of a guy living with 2 girls was virtually worn out and extinct. As a result the content became broader and the show became much funnier. But all of the credit for this improvement is bestowed to John Ritter. This indeed was John Ritter's show and the show would not have had anywhere near the amount of appeal with some other actor. The first season unfortunately does not showcase John Ritter but revolves around the 3 roommates. Nevertheless just his presence is electrifying and his magnificence envelops you. Celebrate the Greatest Show by the Greatest Man through this DVD! ",5.0
" Bursting onto the television landscape in Spring 1977 Three's Company quickly skyrocketed in the ratings - cracking the top 8 every season except its last. Sporting a plethora of quirky characters and fresh writing talent that explored modern day issues the show held its own as one of the funniest programs on TV. Picking up where All In The Family left off Three's Company delved into the social taboos of its day dealing with subjects such as homosexuality racism sexual harassment and of course unmarried men and women living together... But the true success of Three's Company stemmed from the comic talents of John Ritter and Suzanne Somers who became instant stars as a result of their respective roles on the show...In Three's Company John Ritter plays the role of Jack Tripper a young cooking student in San Diego who wants to move into an apartment with his two female friends - the far more mature Janet Wood (Joyce DeWitt) and the blonde and ditsy Chrissy Snow (Suzanne Somers). But the three friends face the possible wrath of landlord Stanley Roper (Norman Fell) an old-fashioned guy who would never allow such an arrangement. With the aid of Roper's wife Helen (Audra Lindley) the three manage to convince Stanley that Jack is gay (when he is in fact a notorious ladies man). Jack's friend Larry (Richard Kline) also fashions himself a player on the local singles scene and he makes regular appearances on the show. Following Season 3 Stanley and Helen left the show in pursuit of their own spin-off titled The Ropers. Don Knotts (of Andy Griffith Show fame) was brought in to play the new landlord Mr. Furley - a nave loud-mouthed ditz who tripled the hilarity of every scene in which he appeared...The Three's Company (Season 1) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere 'A Man About the House' in which roommates Janet Wood and Chrissy Snow throw a going away party for their roommate Eleanor. In search of another roommate to lower the rent burden the two run across Jack Tripper passed out in their bathtub. At first the two women are apprehensive about Jack becoming their third roommate but since they can't cook and he's in cooking school they agree. The only problem is convincing their old-fashioned landlord Stanley Roper to allow a man to live with two women. They convince him by telling Stanley that Jack is gay... Other notable episodes from the shortened Season 1 include 'And Mother Makes Four' in which Chrissy attempts to conceal from her mother that a man is one of her roommates and 'Roper's Niece' in which Mr. Roper sets Jack up with his promiscuous niece in order to see if Jack is really gay...Below is a list of episodes included on the Three's Company (Season 1) DVD",5.0
" It was inevitable that Three's Company would be released on DVD the only surprise is that it took this long to get here. Finally the first 6 episodes of this landmark sitcom that aired between March & April 1977 are preserved on digital. Each episode is a classic in its own right and memorable if you know the show. Three's Company more than anything John Ritter did best displayed his talent for comedy especially physical. Ritter had the ability to turn the lamest storyline into a laughfest. This also is easily his best and most popular work other sitcoms such as 'Hearts Afire' and '8 Simple Rules' hold no comparison and its obvious that the only reason those shows made it was because of Ritter's involvment. The same can be said about Three's Company to some extent not to exclude the contributions of Joyce Dewitt & Suzanne Somers. Some are of the mindset that Chrissy was the show (maybe she just thought that) but I've always thought it was about Jack. He should've been paid more not because he's a man but because if he left the show it would've ended. 8 simple rules doesn't have long believe me. Three's Company was special because all of the characters were important to the show and they each were hilarious in their own right",5.0

" I would have to say that Threes Company is probably one of my all time favorite television sitcoms. I remember trying to watch it when I was a kid but couldnt because the material was deemed to sexually offensive by my parents. Fortunatly I was able to catch the show when I was older and have watched it when I could catch it in reruns. Thanks to Tv Land that was everynight. I would have to say that the release of this DVD was something I had not expected and was very suprised to find it at the store.All six episodes from season one are here to watch and enjoy anytime you like. Sound quality is good and the picture is also pretty good. If you do buy this dvd its for the terrific performances of John Ritter Norman Fell and Audrey Lindley. The only complanint I had with the Dvd is that it does not have a play all feature on the main menu so if a show ends you have to start another one instead of the shows playing straight through.

" I was a late convert to Three's Company but I got into it when my husband started recording episodes on our Tivo. This is a collection of the first six episodes and lays the groundwork for the series. The chemistry among the cast is readily apparent and John Ritter's physical comedy is genius! Janet and Chrissy find Jack passed out in their bathtub one morning after a going away party for their roommate. They need a roommate and Jack needs a place to stay and bing bang boom the premise of the show is born. But this is the 1970's and a man living with two women is a bit scandalous. The Ropers the landlords of the building won't hear of it. So Janet tells the Ropers that Jack is gay. Even watching this show in the 21st century it is evident how ahead of it's time it was. A gay man two women living with a man and innuendos galore demonstrate just how ahead of its time the show was. ",5.0
" What a find!!! This short collection from the first season of Three's Company. The programme is just as funny if not more so than the UK version which most episodes are based upon.Originally screened on ABC without much optimism in spring 1977 the first six episodes introduce us to Jack Tripper and his two female room-mates along with the Ropers - the landlords of the apartment.Just one of the six episodes is a fresh US episode - Roper's Niece which I found to be just as amusing as the other five.The boxset has no extras just a bare bones set with the six episodes. Grest to see the late John Ritter starting in the role he became most famous for.I loved it for the genuine laughs on the show as well as looking at the fashions prices hair and late 70s attitudes on the show.After these six I had to immediately purchase season two which I'm finding just as good as this.Even though it's 30+ years old this is a quality show and well worth owning.

" Has it been almost 30 years since the debut of Three's Company? Many good and bad shows have come and gone but Three's Company remains a familiar sitcom providing laughs and good memories. With the passing of John Ritter still on most fans mind it is extra special to watch the earlier episodes especially. He was a brilliant physical comedian/actor and dramatically underrated too. Gone too are both Audra Lindley and Norman Fell who were so good they branched off and had their own series. They live on in these episodes and in our hearts.One thing interesting about the first season is how different (looking and acting) each character is. Jack and Chrissy are both very into each other but follow the rules and keep things relatively clean. Speaking of Chrissy she is more reserved and not the complete 'ditz' she transforms into in later seasons. Janet too is less bossy and protective. I think only Jack stays pretty much constant through the years.This collection features the following episodes",5.0

This season may be short with only having 6 episodes but it's still worth buying because the episodes are funny and Amazon is offering it at a great low price! ",5.0
" Three's Company first hit the airwaves almost 26 years ago and it presented its North American viewers with a comedic styling that was truly fresh and new. Both the brilliance and the downside of the series lay in the simplicity of its plots. Usually the fun and mayhem of the episodes would result from some sort of mixup or misunderstanding would occur which caused a friction obstacle or problem that the characters would have to overcome. Ultimately the misunderstanding would always be resolved leaving the beloved cast of characters pretty much as we found them. But as with all great comedies the show's strength and uniqueness really did lie in the mix of the show's central characters and the actors that portrayed them. The original casting of John Ritter Joyce DeWitt and Suzzane Somers as Jack Janet & Chrissy - the three roommates of apartment 201 - is perfect right from the start. Add to this mix Norman Fell and Audra Lindley as the romantically frustrated landlords Mr. & Mrs. Roper and you're set for one wild ride of a show. What truly is unique about the series is the fact that the show really was an ensemble piece - and when you revisit this series you really do find that no one actor rose above the rest. All of the actors involved in the show shared a particular gift for comedy especially the late John Ritter whose timing pratfalls and physical comedy truly were second to none. All-in-all it adds up to a great series that really has the power to make you laugh. The show didn't start off so smoothly however as the casting of the female leads took awhile. In fact three pilots were shot all involving different actresses but all involving John Ritter as Jack Tripper. As such the first season of the series which is only six episodes long didn't premiere until March of 1977. And now the entire first season of this series came out on DVD and in spite of a lack of extras Three's Company is worth adding to any DVD collection. ",5.0

" Three's Company is the first and last sitcom to effectively blend physical comendy with effective one liners. Many of the popular sitcoms today such as Friends and Will and Grace have the satisfying one liners but are opaque in the area of physical comedy. John Ritter's falling over the couch tip toeing not to be seen and tripping over things elevate this sitcom from great to amazing.In 1977 the kind of double entendre humor spoken all through the series invoked snarls on conservative TV viewers. Yet it was that same humor that made it numder one on the Nielson Ratings. It's King-like status on TV because of the sexually racy humor attracted viewers because of it's innocence about sex. The humor wasn't for shock value. The lines about promiscuity were delivered by the cast as innocently as we heard it over the tube. That child-like and non 'in your face' approach made Three's Company heartwarming as well as extremly funny.The series had few cameras working with the cast so the episodes have a unparelled equality to a one act on stage. Therefore it is easy to see the cast playing off each other for emotional support as well as professionally. It is hard to watch an episode of this gem and not laugh out loud And it will be extremely difficult not to well an eye for the late 'Man About the House' who paved the way for the phyisical comedians today. This series will never be equalled. ",5.0
" Hello I am the webmaster of the Jack's Bistro website. I received an advanced copy of this wonderful DVD last week and here is my review of it",5.0
" Three's Company is a jewel in the rough who knew that this 70's sitcom can beat out most of what's on TV today. It not only makes you laugh but the intelligent wit sarcasm and charm threw into each episode gives it a kick some jokes and one liners are so good that I can't believe I it took me so long to finally watch this. Of course I didn't discover it myself my boyfriend made me watch it - I saw the entire 1st season in one sitting and that's coming from a girl who doesn't like to watch TV! I couldn't get enough and simply had to see the whole thing.The premise sounds simple enough; two female roommates Janet and Chrissy who have a third roommate Jack - pretending that he's gay in order not to get evicted by the landlords Mr and Mrs. Roper. They are trying to balance their new friendship and the snooping landlords visiting parents and not get caught while going through challenges of life and work in a funny lighthearted manner. The stress in this show is comedic not draining to the viewer.I think there's something cozy and cute about 70's decor and even the semi hideous clothing that I find fascinating. My favorite character is the landlady her sarcasm is priceless and her smug remarks jabbing at her husband and lack of passion in the bedroom are sharp but unquestionably hilarious. Her eye rolling and faces are priceless too her character ads a level of delightful mischief to the show. The first season is just six episodes but I all ready have the rest and can't wait to sink into it. The real fun part is that each episode has a theme and things always go crazy and get out of hand for the roommates. Not getting caught or figuring out the problem is always a fun resolution at the end of each show.Fun and easy to watch perfect for the weekend when you can sit down grab a snack and try not to fall of the couch from laughing.- Kasia S.

" Readers when you purchase this dvd put on the pilot episode (entitled 'Man About The House') and fast - foward to the scene were Chrissy Snow (Suzanne Somers) finds Jack Tripper (John Ritter) asleep in the bathtub drenched in water. It is not only one of the funniest moments in tv history but the scene that shows what a genius Ritter really was.The release of 'Three's Company' on dvd is a bittersweet event for the show's fan. While it's great to have this piece of television history to watch anytime you'd like it's also sad because comes just months after John Ritter's shocking and untimely death. But as a tribute to his life and career it's great to have.And I'm not saying that Ritter was the only actor who made the people laugh. Somers and Joyce DeWitt (Janet Wood) set up most of the gags that happened on the show and sometimes outdid Ritter. And who can forget the late Norman Fell and Audra Lindley as Mr. Roper and his sex - hungry wife Helen. Their one -liners against each other were every bit as funny as Ritter getting smashed by a door or Somers delivering one of her stupid comments. Making an early appearance is Larry played flawlessly by the highly underrated Richard Kline. He appears briefly in 'No Children No Dogs'.As for the episodes the pilot is an absolute classic. 'No Children No Dogs' and 'It's Only Money' are excellent as well (the former features some of the best insluts between Helen and Stanley). As for the other three they are good too but not worth mentioning.My only gripe about this dvd is that there are no extras. No advertisements or a making - of documentary. I do not know if Anchor Bay meant to do this right from the start or they did out of respect for John Ritter. But it doesn't matter since the complete second season is coming out on dvd in March and is supposed to be loaded with extra. Until then this will keep you satisfid for a long time and you'll remember that three's company too. ",5.0

" I really can't add much that the prior reviewers have mentioned. I remember watching these shows when they first came on. I was 10. I'm almost 40 and they are still a blast..... Timeless and ageless. I enjoyed all the seasons but as in most TV series the first few years are the best. Someone watching these shows for the first time as 're-runs'...... May think shows like this were the norm in the 1970's but it was quite groundbreaking. However the bottom line is.... still great comedy after all these years!!!! ",5.0

" Three's Company will always be the best comedy show that was on TV. When I heard that John Ritter had passed I did shed tears for the man because he was the best and will always be the best comedian out there. I have been waiting for the show to come out on DVD for a very long time. When I was a kid I would beg my mom to stay up so that I could watch the show.

" Yes Norman Fell was a hilarious actor who will be missed. But John Ritter's antics and humor is what made the show the gem that it is. Without him that show wouldn't have lasted a season. There could have been no else to perform with the silly sweetness that John had. He was hilarious but at the same time heartfelt and honest. I love Norman I agree with you that he was very funny but give John the respect that he deserves. Without John there would not have been a Three's Company. ",5.0

Oddly enough I watched it on VH1 in the middle of the night thanks to pregnancy induced insomnia. I loved the show. John Ritter was a comedy genius. Such a physical actor like Lucille Ball he had great timing wonderful facial expressions and he owned every scene he was in. The girls and landlords are good too Jack and Janet played so well off each other. Thoroughly enjoyed this show! ",5.0
" I never realize that season 1 only had 6 episodes. I guess they were still testing the waters at that time.

" Watching Three's Company again after all these years I did laugh a lot and not only because of some nostalgic feeling that overwhelmed me having grown up expecting every single episodeevery single week with a sort of enthusiasm that comes with the anticipation that something good is about to happen; But I also enjoyed watching the show again because simply it is one of the best sitcoms ever produced for television in any language.Yet I could not help feeling a tinge of sadnessreliving all these funny and wonderful episodes at the early and untimely death of its star John Ritter.The success of Three's Company was certainly due to the excellent writing that combined successfully the situation comedy with the physical/slapstick genreone that unfortunately is nowadays either overlooked by the new breed of comedy writers or not well written/deliveredin addition to a very 70s touch of sexual innuendos and harmless cliches about 'bimbos' and 'gays' that were good natured and never sexist or discriminatory.All the actors contributed their best comic talents and timing to the show from the cute and smart Joyce de Witt the naive sexy and sweet Suzanne Sommers the Roppers Norman Fell and Audra Lindley to the later actors who replaced some characters like the genuis of a comedian that is Don Knotts who became the new landlord post '79 to Sommers replacements Priscilla Barnes and Jenilee Harrison.But as much as the show made these actors household names its success was equally due to Ritter.The sweet clumsy and charming qualities he brought to Jack endeared him with millions of viewers and ensured that the show ran from its first season in 1977 all the episodes from which are included in this DVD to its last season in 1984 amazing continuity",5.0
" FINALLY! No more need to keep knocking on the door -- It's here in all it's 70s glory! The first season of Three's Company has arrived and I'm here to tell you about it.Well it is only six episodes -- but all on one disc. Reason being is that Three's Company was a mid-season replacement so there's only six to begin with.Not much on the extras but a nice bonus. From the menu you get to pick which one you want to watch and when you select it it has a quick written overview of each episode. Unusual and nice for a DVD TV series. Bad part is once you watch an episode you can't hit the forward button to pass up the credits or go to the next scene -- it automatically ends the episode taking you back to the main menu.Otherwise you'll be happy to know that a percentage of the cost of the first season DVD will go to John Ritter's favorite charity for cerebral palsy (something his older brother suffered from) and that the next season will have more of a tribute to John. So whereas the contents are fairly minimal the price is definitely worth it and more will come in the next disc.No more waiting for you 'Door Knockers' out there -- Three's Company is here to stay.

" I am so happy to see this DVD. I only hope the other seasons will become availabe as well. The greatest sitcom in tv history as far as I'm concerned. 'Jack' is adored by my 8-year old little girl (and myself). Rest in peace John and thank you for bringing laughter and joy to my home. ",5.0
" This was a classic show... and let me tell you it easily holds up against today's sitcoms. I laughed so many times during each epsiode... usually because of John Ritter's style of comedy but really every actor in this show has their moments. And when you hear the audience laughing that's no laugh track that's a REAL audience which really adds to the quality of the show.Watching the show mostly when I was younger I had no idea until now how good the writing was on this show... it's actually very intricately written and pushes the level of comedy to the max! A really amazing show!And if you are worried that the first season of Three's Company may not be as good as the later seasons have no fears the first season is hilarious!The DVD has a short synopsis of each episode no other features. The image quality is excellent. ",5.0

" Here is one of John Ritter's funniest shows from the 70's.This show featured a lot of diffent faces thru the years but was always funny.Jack Tripper was always getting into difficult situations and was very clumsey.One of my favorite episodes is when he dressed as a Grandma to enter a cookie contest to win some money.Than the Judge tried to kiss him and he coughed and got out of it.Also Jack had to pretend he was gay so he could live with two girls.The Roper's and Furly were pretty funny to.Here is the episodes from season 1.Note this was a short season and only contained six episodes.1)A Man About The House-This was the pilot that started it all.2)And Mother Makes Four3)Roper's Niece4)No Children No Pets5)Jack The Giant Killer6)It's Only MoneyThere will be no extras on this disc however season 2 early next year will have plenty of them according to Anchor Bay.Originally season 1 wasn't suppose to come out till early 2004 and Ritter was going to do a commentary but it got moved up to November.What a great way to honer John Ritter by getting this set and all future three's company seasons sets.Now if only Seinfield would hurry and come out.I also recommend the following tv dvds coming out.Sanford And Son Season 3 Oct 7Incredible Hulk Ultimate Tv Colection Oct 21Little House On The Prairie Season 3 Nov 4Honeymooners The Complete 39 Episodes Nov 11 ",5.0
" The 1970s' marked the rise of the sitcom. There were early signs of this in the 1960s' with shows like 'The Nelsons' and 'The Donna Reed Show'. Shows like 'All In The Family' were among the first hit sitcoms But the sitcoom boom didn't really take off untila round 1974 when 'Happy Days' and 'Good Times' hit the air. These shows opened the door for a long line of sitcom hits - 'The Jeffersons' 'The Facts Of Life' 'Barney Miller' and many others to name a few. Thrown into this barrage of sitcoms was 'Three's Company'. It turned out to be tv gold garnering huge ratings and making star out of Joyce DeWitt Suzanne Somers and of course the late John Ritter.'Three's Company' was first aired in 1977. Shows like the ones I just mentioned were in their peak period. But 'Three's Company' was different from most. Its plotline was more risque",5.0
" I have almost every episode on VHS videotape and they are now falling apart. Whenever I am in a 'blah' mood and need a 'pick-me-up'...bam I pop in an old tape. I had recorded them all on VHS at LP mode to fit six hours of shows per tape....man am I glad to see them coming on DVD and I already pre-ordered season one. I live in Los Angeles area and I actually went to at least 30 tapings of the show over the span of it's TV production run. Can't wait to see the DVD version.....(I only hope they kept the bloopers/outtakes and interviews etc. and they make it to the DVD's as 'special bonus features'.) They goofed up sometimes and the studio audience always loved it!John Ritter's humor and schtick filtered it's way into my style of bartending when I worked for TGI Friday's in the 80's. It helped my tip income for sure. I hope they put out 'Hooperman' on DVD and only wish Hooperman could have been given a better chance than the one season run it had. BUY this DVD if you love humor that is timeless at times it seems John borrowed from the great ones like the Stooges Abbott and Costello and the young Jerry Lewis and put his own touch on it....The ladies on the show gave John the perfect platform to do his thing!

" I haven't watched THREE's COMPANY in 7 years. I own every single episode of the series on VHS but I decided to purchase this DVD because I read the good reviews concerning the quality. Indeed the quality is great but the smart ear will hear some audio changes on the episode 'Roper's niece'. All of a sudden the sound becomes slighly inconsistent with the rest of the episode for about a minute going back and forth; you will hear certain sentences on the right side of your TV speakers and then switching to the left; you must really have very sharp ears to notice this change. Overall great transfer and great investment. ",5.0

" Anchor Bay is doing us a solid in making the short season one (it was a spring replacent show in 1977) into a quick and inexpensive single disc release out well before the end of 2003. I had a chance to catch part of the recent 'Three's Company' marathon in which 2 of the 6 episodes from this season were aired -- 'Pilot' and 'Roper's Niece' -- both of which had my sides splitting. The pilot episode could not have been executed any better and it appears as if this was one of only a handful of TV series in the annals of history that began a long run already in full stride. And in six episodes nonetheless!I highly recommend this and future season releases beginning in 2004 -- which will contain bonus materials! John Ritter may be gone but thanks to his large body of work and my DVD player I won't be forgetting him.(For those thinking Anchor Bay is simply out to make a buck off the passing of TV legend John Ritter take notice",5.0
" The first season of Three's Company. One of the funniest sitcoms around. The story of two girls who need a roommate. After throwing a party (in the first episode) Janet and Chrissy find a man sleeping in their bathtub. . .eventually they become roommates.A lot of storylines on the show revolved around misconceptions and misunderstandings. The on-going joke that the landlord thinks that Jack is gay. In the first three seasons the landlords are an older couple named The Ropers. And their on-going joke about him not wanting to sleep with her. Kind of like Al Bundy on Married...with Children.Guaranteed many laughs. Rest in peace John Ritter. ",5.0
" Finally this show has came to DVD. I'm looking forward to this DVD and I hope they come out with the other seasons rather quickly. This show is defintely one of my favs. Never could understand why they want to put these new shows on DVD after still never went off the air as of yet. Glad somebody is finally waking up hope they get the same idea and put WKRP in Cincinnati on DVD. Where have these great sit-coms gone? This dvd will give a great tribute to John Ritter. ",5.0
" I know there are people who don't like Three's Company and think it's too silly but I think they just didn't give it a chance. My older sister who is nine years older than me doesn't like it and thinks it's too silly but she is very picky anyway and is more into drama shows. I love this show which in my opinion is a classic! Joyce Dewitt and Suzanne Somers were very good as Janet Wood and Chrissy Snow and so were Norman Fell and Audra Lindley as landlords Stanley and Helen Roper but my favorite of all was John Ritter as Jack Tripper he was so cute and funny and he will be greatly missed! Jack's friend Larry played by Richard Kline only appears in one episode in the first season but thankfully becomes a regular for the rest of the seasons. The DVD only has 6 episodes because the first season was a mid season replacement. All of the 6 episode are very funny I don't have one favorite but I like them all the same. The price of the DVD is very reasonable and proceeds are being donated to UCP (United Cerebral Palsy) in memory of John who's brother has CP. A very worthy cause! I very highly recommend this DVD and I'm looking forward to getting the second season and all the rest of the seasons. John Ritter will be missed but never forgotten! BTW",5.0

" I can't remember the last time I read such a dire book. I howled with laughter all the way through wondering how much worse it could get - and sure enough it got worse. If the writing is bad the plot is ludicrous. A preacher comes to offer condolences the same afternoon that the heroine's husband is shot dead. Within moments they are having sex. The sex is not sensually treated or beautifully described - no all they do is stick their tongues down each other's throats. The preacher goes to tell his paralysed wife. Her bizarre response - wait for it - is to stick her tongue down his throat. No wonder he veers away. The heroine runs off to work in the heart of Liverpool in a rose garden ten miles long (I kid you not). Did I mention she is dying? But never mind she'll make a miraculous recovery. She meets another man - even though conveniently he's dying too and she's pregnant by the preacher by now (and oh joy she hears the heartbeat of the fetus at a week... truly a miracle)! The other man lives in castle and is very rich. Of course. They consumate their affair when she sticks her tongue down his throat. Not to worry she doesn't have to perform this crude tonsil-tickling for long. The preacher turns up again. Everyone in the way drops dead leaving the coast free for the 'wicked saints' of the title to romp without blame or shame into the sunset.I could have kicked myself for buying this book; but I had been fooled by reading a mention of it by a so-called reviewer of The Mermaid Chair (which is a good book.) Then I checked all the other reviews done by reviewers of Ms Haddon's book (you can click on 'other reviews' to see what I mean) and believe I have spotted a scam. The reviewers appear to have chosen the same half dozen best sellers to review -- each on the same day! - and in each review of these other genuinely good books they mention Wicked Saints in the most glowing terms. This is cynical piggy-back riding on bona fide books made worse because this is a very badly edited (and badly written) self published book. I hope few people will be fooled as I was - and as Amazon has been. Be warned! ",1.0

" The topic explored by the author is the practice of forgery in late Antiquity to substantiate a religious cult's legitimacy. As a revised version of the author's doctoral thesis and his first book it has page after page of unnecessary excerpts whose sole purpose seems to be to let the reader know that the author really has passed his language proficiency exams. These are then followed an apology trying to explain why they really were worth quoting. It is a very boring read. Besides these stylistic annoyances the entire structure of the book takes the form of a survey of various instances of pseudepigrapha... which are then dutifully stretched back to the initial lackluster thesis. There are no fantastic insights in this book. Unless you are doing a specialization in this field I would not recommend buying this book. There are many better books in the study of religion to be savored. If you must have it for a specialization I would recommend finding it at a university library... though it may have a limited availability since it is only a revamped standard doctoral thesis that is not widely applicable in many areas of study.

Most of his ideas aside from being mostly incoherant and physically absurd also defy the time-tested and true concepts that the average high-school physics student could debunk. Furthermore mixed in with these insane babblings are religious and political ramblings which he tries to pass off as the only possible truth.My recommendation unless you want a good laugh or evidence of the under-education of many Americans pass on this book. Any other use of your money would be a better one. ",1.0
" I bought this CD for one song only 'Steal Away'. I knew it was going to be 'live' but this isn't even close to the radio version. Try more like a 'muzik lounge' sound. It was recorded in a ballroom. Then the only other song I recognized was 'Hot Rod Hearts' again done the Vegas lounge style. I wish I could get my $$ back. Why didn't he just put out the CD using the regular recordings? He was never a big star to begin with. I wrote this review just to warn people that it isn't like most 'live' recordings. I was very dissapointed and I still don't have a decent recording of 'Steal Away'! ",1.0
" I really can't understand why all the reviewers are going crazy over this record. First off I bought it without hearing anything by them before but it had been highly recomended to people who like Tool and Mars Volta by Amazon!! They couln't have been any more wrong. So why did i personally find this so painfull?Well the whole thing in general is quite painfull. First off the musicians. The whole band sound like studio musicians. No obvious indivuality or anything new to offer. Then we get to the vocals. The closest thing I can compare them to are Alison Moyet or Anthony and the johnsons. I don't mind Anthony and the Johnsons but this guys vocals and the music just don't rock. Which is fine. It's ok not to rock! But why the hell being a Tool fan and Mars volta fan was I recomended this? It's bland it's week and the dubby bass boring guitar playing/sound... weak vocals.. Actually forget it. The whole package. It is just lame. ",1.0

" Lewis Keel is a music teacher in the New York public school system and while my hat's off to him for devoting his life to this worthy profession I have to say that he sounds like a high school musician. Having been a high school saxophonist myself I can honestly say I recognize talent when I hear it and it isn't heard in high school bands very often.He has the technical skills to get around the instrument as he adequately demonstrates on 'Day by Day' and 'Anthropology' but he has no real touch or feeling for what he's playing. Moreover he's prone to squeaks and squawks a la the kids who play woodwinds in public school bands. Maybe I'm just tired of hearing some of the old stand-bys like 'Love for Sale' and 'Lover Come Back to Me' but if so Lewis Keel is contributing to it. His treatment of 'Quiet Nights' is about as clinical as it gets a style I would call 'Bossa Snora.'I'm sorry Lewis. I know you're probably a good man but stick to teaching and stay out of the recording studio. ",1.0

I called the customer service and asked for refund or replacement and they were kind enough to replace the vacuum with a new one.

" If you can read the above lines out loud with a straight face you just might be able to take Max Brand's Donnegan seriously. The novel has several weaknesses but the one that turns it into a spectacular failure is its ludicrous framing story.Donnegan a short red-haired tramp rides the rails in search of a man named Rusty Dick (please no snickering). Having discovered that his quarry is dead Donnegan jumps off the train forces his way into a stranger's house and falls in love with the owner's daughter on the spot. The owner one Colonel Macon sends Donnegan with his daughter to the Corner a mining town hoping that the girl will win back her lover Jim Landis from the shadowy Lord Nick who has horned in on the Colonel's profitable business arrangements with Landis. Failing that Donnegan is to kill Landis.This nearly intolerable beginning then gives place to a fairly good second act; the Corner turns out to be an interesting place with interesting characters. Donnegan wins himself an ally a giant black fighting man named George Washington Green while the beautiful scheming Nelly Lebrun proves a formidable obstacle to Donnegan. Jim Landis proves to be no opponent at all but a mere human football whom the real players are fighting to possess.Donnegan's character gets more fleshed out in the second act. As in Destry Rides Again Max Brand shows a talent for portraying a hero who is severely and obviously flawed - lazy an almost pathological liar perpetually needing to prove his manhood - yet nonetheless lovable for that. Indeed Donnegan is so flawed that the story seems to be inevitably heading for a tragic denouement that might redeem the absurdity of the first act.Unfortunately there's no such luck. Almost from the minute the shadowy Lord Nick walks on the stage (his true identity should surprise no one) the story careers off into utter absurdity again. The characters' motivations none too credible to begin with now contort into self-parody. Don't feel bad if you can make no sense whatsoever out of the last few chapters; everybody including the characters themselves is just as confused as you are.Unlike many later Western authors many of whom preferred to tiptoe around the question of racism Max Brand places race relations front and center in this novel even more than in Destry Rides Again. This time we get a clearer picture of what Brand's own racial attitudes were",1.0

" Don't buy this game because you will forever wonder why you did so. This is the worst racing game I have ever played. The bonus games are crap and are all the same thing. If this was even a decent game there would be a reason to play the bonus games. But there's not. Sure you get money but with the best car in the game fully upgraded (why did I waste my time) you can't tell a difference in the race from a crap car. All the upgrades do is take your money and waste your time.The actual racing is just as bad. Sometimes when you hit a cone you will keep right on going and even get extra in your boost gauge. Other times I have gone flying off the track because of a single cone. I don't know why and at this point I really don't care.The races beyond the very first ones are way too difficult. It is more luck than skill. In other words there is almost no way to get first and you will only get in the top 3 if the other players take themselves out. Computer cars beat the best and fully upgraded car off the line and can turn corners in about half the time without losing speed. All you can do is watch them drive away.Oh and one last thing the shortcuts suck. They are not shortcuts and usually end up taking longer because it is like threading a needle and with the handling being so bad. If you even stray a little from the exact route you will be out of bounds and have to reset. If you hit anything even going very slow you will be thrown from your car and lose time. If you do manage to do it right you might still come out behind where you were. I have only found 3 races out of 75 or whatever it is that actually have a shortcut that is worth taking. And by worth taking I mean doesn't lose you time and doesn't gain it either. Talk about a crap game. Please consider not buying this game.Bottom line",1.0

" I purchased this thermometer because we wanted an accurate thermometer and were tired of the generic drug store thermometers. We definitely need to be provided an accurate on spot temp due to my daughters health issues. I was super excited to receive this thermometer right away!!! Shipping was GREAT! I opened it read the manual and then took her temp ( knowing she was hot ) it said 98.8. I pulled out our old thermometer and it registered 100.4 THIS IS AN ISSUE! I thought maybe it was just this one time and tried it again later that evening knowing she was still running a fever. It read 99.9 old thermometer read 100.9. YET AGAIN AN ISSUE!!! I continued to try both thermometers the next day while she still had a temp and STILL had the same large variation in temps. My husband decided to call the company. No answer no answering service. He called WelchAllyn since we had no response from the Medical Supply Company. They asked if we purchased this thermometer in June? He said ummm no we just bought it 5 days ago. The associate said well this thermometer is registered as being purchased in June and we aren't sure if this Medical Supply company is a registered seller of these WelchAllyn thermometers. They are having a supervisor call us tomorrow. We called the Medical supply company yet again and finally had someone answer unfortunately they seem like they could care less about the fact that it is not working and they definitely do not care that this could have been previously owned and returned. They told us there is a 15% restocking fee for returning it unless WelchAllyn says it was previously owned. WHAT!!! So they don't know if they are selling items that are previously owned and obviously faulty? The associate at WelchAllyn said this may have been returned due to being faulty and now is being sold as 'New' through this company. THIS IS RIDICULOUS CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SALES SERVICE!!!! These thermometers may be PREVIOUSLY OWNED AND USED AND BEING SOLD AS 'NEW'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will update this as soon as a I speak with a supervisor tomorrow! ",1.0
" This was the first book I've read by Jamaica Kincaid and it will be my last.This book was not only BAD it was depressing. Xuela didn't loved anyone because no one loved her. She was a bitter and angry person. The line 'I did not know my mother because she died at the moment of my birth' was repeated about 100 times throughout the book.I don't know why the book was named 'Autobiography of my Mother' because she never knew her mother and constantly throughout the book said so. She hated her father because he was in a position of 'power' and took advantage of others. One other thing that bothered me about this book was her habit of touching her private parts in public and smelling her hands after. I found this hard to believe that Xuela would be so 'free' in Dominica at the time period in this book. Touching ones self is taboo among most black people whether you're born in Africa America or the West Indies.The only interesting part about this book is when her lover's wife confronted her in the street.Maybe if the book wasn't written in such a 'defeated and depressing' way it would have been better but the author's tone contridicts Xuela's 'I-don't-care-about-anyone' attitude. Xuela stated she was content or happy with herself but the tone didn't suggest that at all. ",1.0
" I really wanted to like this book based on the title and the cover art. Instead I found myself not caring about the narrator whatsoever. She repeats the same few thoughts throughout the entire book. She reminds the reader that her mother is dead and that nobody loves her so many times that I stopped caring about her situation. Her repetition and monotone voice stops the narrator from being truly developed as a character that we can connect with. Some parts of her story seem unnecessary and pointless as they don't really lead to anything of interest later on. Her characterization was too direct and left nothing for the reader to consider for themselves. The title is extremely misleading as we learn absolutely nothing about her mother- aside from her death during childbirth. I am unable to find anything positive to describe about this book sadly.

" There are plenty of tension rods out there. The _only_ advantage of the Umbra rods is that they look better. (Why other manufacturers haven't figured out the design part is anybody's guess.) The problem with the Umbra rods -- all of them -- is NO tension. I have tried these repeatedly.... Why? Because my local hardware store carries them and they are readily available elsewhere and I have opted for form over function. Every single Umbra rod I have used fails drastically. They simply cannot bear any weight. Or to put it differently they cannot exert enough force against the surfaces they extend out to for them to bear any load. Worse the springs that are the key element in sustaining the tension tend to fail. When those springs fail anything you have suspended by the rod will come down.

" This has been the worst experience of a major renovation; The tub was dropped off outside our condo by the freight company; they wanted $80.00 more to bring it upstairs; which we were not advised prior.

" Three or four years back I wrote a screenplay about a Marine who comes back from IRAQ. He is struggling to adapt to civilian life and hold onto his relationship with his wife when she is abducted in a bank robbery.As his life crumbles and the police seem less interested in recovering his wife he goes the vigilante route tracking interrogating and diving into dangerous situations ultimately leading him to Las Vegas where he uncovers a large scale plot that is bigger than he or anyone could ever imagine.Other than the fact that my script is more complex and has better dialogue the biggest difference between my script and THE MARINE is that the lead character in my script is REAL. A real flesh and blood human being Marine with vulnerabilities emotions and he actually bleeds. He's a real person like somebody you might know from your town who went to Iraq.While THE MARINE'S John Triton (John Cena) is bulletproof explosion proof dives through walls unscratched hangs onto semi-trucks while it drives through buildings and despite the bombardment of boards pipes and tin sheets he rolls off and groans before jumping up and kicking more butt. Not to mention I don't think a scene goes by that he doesn't remind everybody that he's a Marine and it's the only thing he knows. By the way the tin sheets would have severed him easily.Oh and of course the name Triton is appropriate to refer to John Cena as a Greek God or the largest moon of Neptune.Ridiculous is an understatement. This movie insults our intelligence with a symplistic unrealistic poorly written story. Deplorable acting from all involved. Was this movie trying to be a comedy? The jewl thieves are idiots and are more concerned with trying to be comedic than to try to come up with a plan to escape.The real shame is that my script is pretty well useless now. The creators of this movie make dozens of references to my script in the early goings and now my script is old news. Unfortunately hollywood big wigs have put their MONEY behind THE MARINE a silly poorly written poorly thought out poorly acted piece of junk.You need more than dozens of unrealistic and over-the-top explosions to grab this reviewer. Unfortunately I have a brain and I need more from my action movie than this stupid movie that has absolutely nothing in it that is memorable or meritable. ",1.0

But no. They hold on to her.The marine runs/jumps in slow motion away from explosions at least 4 times in this movie.

" This film is complete and total garbage i mean its really bad. John plays a Marine who gets kicked out of the Corps after defying orders to save the lives of some Marines. I wont even get into that rats nest of crap. So he is discharged from the Marines and is trying to start working a civilian job. While on a road trip with his wife some people who robbed a jewelery store and happened to stop at the same gas station end up kidnapping his wife and begins his outrageously stupid and ill scripted pursuit. Fact is John was able to track his targets through the marsh and swamp while quite often they were on a road. The thought process that i have would be is that they could take any back road/dirt road or anything that connect to the main road they would be gone and he would be heading in the completely wrong direction. However somehow he is always able to find the bad guys. My biggest complain is that it is a movie about a Marine and he never really uses a gun he takes them and never uses them. I think the person who wrote it doesn't realize that every Marine is a rifleman and i cannot think of one who wouldn't use a gun to protect his wife. This movie is your standard WWE/WWF film that solves everything with hand to hand combat scenes. I mean come on if i would of wanted to watch a fighting movie then that is what i would've bought. However i bought a movie titled MARINE i fully expect there to be FIREFIGHTS and shooting. That is what really irritates me along with the pathetic acting is that it doesn't make sense. Marines are trained to use guns but this guy doesn't seem to use them even when his wife is in danger.I'm not really sure i can convey to you how bad this movie is.It would be a good film for people who prefer hand to hand combat and like movies with really bad acting and holes in the plot so big you can drive a semi truck threw them.This movie starts out bad and just gets worse and worse.Horrible Movie 1/5 stars.

The car chase scene with all them bullets hitting the car and Cena is still driving and able to avoid every single bullet. He's hit with multiple objects but still no mark on him. The wife gets knocked the hell out so many times but no bruise on her at all. This movie was ridiculous don't waste your time unless you're a Cena mark. ",1.0
" Now The Marine doesn't try to be a good movie it lets you know right from the beginning what it is going to be. A huge muscleman marine is told to wait for the rest of the soldiers on a mission. He says 'not enough time' and charges in to blow things up. Next scene he is being discharged and has to go find a job as a security guard. This is all in the first 2 minutes of the movie. The thing that really bothered me about the movie was that everything that went on really had no point and did not make a difference later in the film. That isn't the only thing they weren't able to complete not by a long shot. The bad guys have this big black guy on their side and he is not unfunny they just don't give him anything funny to say. I seriously think that he didn't complete a single joke. In fact the liquid metal guy from Terminator 2 stars as the main bad guy and they even throw in a reference to that and it was the only joke they actually completed. I thought that it was the least bad part of the movie.Now the reason I went to see this was becasue I was told it had great fights. The shootouts were nice to look at and the explosions became so repetitious I almost fell asleep but the fights were once again just the same old I hit you and then you hit me style. The best fight of the movie included 2 characters who were never explained and this scene could have been from entirely different film for all I know. So if you are looking for the worst big budget movie of the year then check this out. ",1.0
" You really have to give it up to wrestling promoter Vince McMahon. He has failed miserably with the WBF XFL and programs on MTV & he couldn't sell a quality meal in New York City. So Vince now tries that magic business touch in the film industry. Huh?It appears that Vince has just a little jealousy towards 'The Rock' Dwayne Johnson and his great success making movies to the point where he doesn't need to do any bumps for the WWE and the McMahon family. Granted Vince receives a nice sum of cash for Johnson's wrestling moniker to be used for movies but that just isn't enough.And where Johnson has long-since passed up the 1980s-styled superhero genre here comes Vince lumbering along in his powerwalk with his answer to The Rock John Cena. Yes that John Cena who was going to be a hip-hop star; until he proved that he has no hip and zero hop in his mic skills.But have a script comparable with Sylvester Stallone's ridiculous Rambo character - with Cena's mannerisms that could be termed as the nephew to the fictional tough-guy - blow all kinds of things up and Vince is in business. Hardly.The first weekend in theaters October 13-15 2006 The Marine did a tepid $7 million in box office sales and then sank faster than a pay-per-view main event featuring Fit Finlay.Cena plays his WWE role well but he isn't a real actor. Vince is a wrestling promoter who has failed each time he has stepped outside the family business. The Marine was produced 20-plus years too late to have anyone but the biggest WWE Cena fans taking time to see it in theaters.And Vince better keep that cozy economic reality in mind for the next flick.

" ...is a lie and the truth isn't in them!!This movie was awful. From begining to end. Even the title didn't match. Marine? He was a Marine for all of 5 minutes of the movie!! LOL. But that isn't the worse part.The acting was terrible. Even the good actors (Robert Patrick) played terrible roles. The plot was unbelieveable the action was unbelieveable and the comedy was corny.

" this movie is an awful movie. the acting is horrible and the actors try to hard to try and be funny which just makes the movie painful. the main character played by john cena seems to have animal like reflexes and instincts seeming to be able to track the bad guys down by stupid things like sniffing the air and following non-existent clues. Im not going to go into every stupid part of this movie but ill just say its EXTREMELY unrealistic. its so bad i think a 5 year old can point out the ridiculous things john cena 'can' do. for example hes able to practically fly and jump onto a moving truck from standing on the ground. he is also able to survive being inside a building that blows up and looks as though the atom bomb was dropped on it yet somehow he still is alive. also i might be crazy but im pretty sure if you were holding onto a truck and being rammed through a building at fast speeds you wouldnt live. also not many people i know can run through walls and not be hurt. speaking of not being hurt there is an instance in the movie while inside a burning building john cena is hit by falling burning wood and is unaffected. this movie is awful and i would recommend if your looking for an action movie to look somewhere else. i cant believe people actually buy this movie and can watch it without wanting to cry.

Cena has to be one of the worst actors to ever get a starring role in a movie released in theaters. Attack of the show's Chris Gore put it at best when he said that they tried to hide the bad acting with a bunch of explosion and action. The storyline itself was bad because well it has already been done a million times before. A guy's girlfriend/wife is kidnapped and he tries to get her back.

It's amazing that hundreds of bullets can be fired at point blank range with no one getting hit and people getting hit in the face with fire extinguishers pieces of wood and other objects without so much as a scratch. And then there are people surviving incredible explosions again without getting so much as a hangnail. The directors attempt at moments of humor failed miserably.

This is the type of movie that The Last Action Hero made fun of. Ridiculous action scenes that defy all logic and the corny one-liners spouted in this movie makes the one-liners in Batman and Robin seem hip. Dont waste precious time on this movie.

This is one movie i wouldn't recommend to anyone except the extreme fans of the WWE or maybe the little kids who believe the storylines in wrestling are actually real drama.one fine point that i thought was extremely humorous about the movie. How is it that you can drive a camero (or whatever the cop car was) at top speeds with a million and one bullet holes in it and not either a) blow up b) blow a tire c) just die or d) not allow the driver to get hit from any of the million and one bullets?i certainly hope this movie was supposed to be strictly a comedy because if it wasn't the director should be shot and left in the car that mysteriously didn't blow up.

So I though I'd give Asimov a chance. To my surprise I didn't like this book at all.I have read some bad books in my life but this is the first bad book I bothered to read all the way through. I kept waiting for it to get better. I kept waiting for the 'eureka' moment when I finally understood why everyone likes this book so much. It never happened and when I finally came to the end of the book I realized that Mr. Azimov stole a good two hours of my life and gave me NOTHING in return.The story sounds interesting and in the hands of another writer it may have bore fruit. Unfortunately in Mr Asimoz's hands the story falls flat in the implementation. Had the writing not been funny I would have been completely bored. Of course Mr. Azimov did not intentionally make me laugh - sadly his understanding of the human condition appears to be based largely on old cheap pulp fiction novels. The characters are completely one dimensional and unconvincing. I truly cannot understand why anyone would like this book - but calling it a classic is simply unbearable. I can only assume that most of the people reviewing this book favorably are children. In any case they are certainly not familiar with truly good writing. My advice",1.0
" Being a sci-fi fan myself I decided I wanted to try reading some of the works by the giants of sci-fi. I had always heard how great 'Foundation' was so I thought I'd start with this one. I was thoroughly disappointed! Asimov used way too many large words ('using dollar words where dime words would suffice'). The story seemed to jump around from one time to another. The characters were very one-dimensional and very flat...I didn't have that 'I wonder what's going to happen next to ---'. I just didn't care what was going to happen next to the characters or in the story. There didn't seem to be anything to propel this story along; nothing to develop the characters or the story. I read over 100 pages and I still had no interest in what was happening. (Even Stephen King who can be pretty tough to get into his stories has me hooked within 50 to 60 pages!) I just don't get what all the hype is over this book. Could someone out there PLEASE tell me! I will try to get into his Robot series...maybe he has better character and story development in them...I hope! ",1.0
" The Foundation is completely undeserving of the fame accredited to it. Had it been more eloquently executed the collage of textbook style narrative and bad dialogue might have been sufficient to generate a bearable story.

His writing style is bland and every one of his characters can be found by an other name in star wars. ",1.0
" After somehow assiduously avoiding Asimov's seminal 'masterpiece' for over 50 years since I began reading sci-fi I decided to dip into this ponderous tome.Oh forsooth the ancient bard's Shakespearean language came alive once more only this time more than 12000 years into the future.But lo some things have never changed",1.0
" I just finished reading Foundation and was extremely disappointed. Maybe I was expecting too much something grander along the line of the Dune series. But the book in of itself is an extreme disappointment. I realize Asimov was young (21) when he wrote this but his style leaves a lot to be desired. I'll take an early Arthur C. Clarke book over Asimov any day. This is the first book by Asimov I've read and I'm not sure I want to read another. His style is very dialogue driven with very few if any detail given to what the characters think. Everyone is very two-dimensional. And he never describes any of the scenes were all of this dialog takes place. Part of the interest in science-fiction is exploring new places seeing different things. This entire story could have taken place on an empty stage. In fact it seems like it's written more for a play than a novel. As for the story it starts out interestingly enough. The Empire is going to crumble and to avoid thousands of years of dark-ages a Foundation is set up to preserve the past learning's of the Empire. Well that's what the original thought was at least. Soon we discover there's an alternate motive to this. Once we learn of this motive the story goes straight downhill. Asimov skips decades from one page to another. Characters are introduced that we know practically nothing about and he never tells us anything about them. I've read history books that had more character development than he gives the people in this book. By the time I got to the end I found myself saying 'So what'? Am I supposed to continue on reading this series because it's been called a 'classic'. I've seen the word 'classic' thrown around a little too much sometimes. This is definitely one of those times.

" Recently finding myself with a lot of time on my hands after having just graduated school I started picking up and reading a lot of the 'greatest' works of science fiction. After having noticed all the editorials reviews and awards attributed to the Foundation series I didn't hesitate to order all the books in the series. What a mistake! I'm not sure what people are seeing in these novels but in no way do they even come close to approaching some of the other hallmarks of sci-fi like Dune Ender's Game you name it. This book has a semi-interesting setup about trying to preserve civilization during a coming galactic dark age but beyond that the book devolves into stupid scenario after scenario about how the Foundation is threatened but through the citizens' skill (i.e. sheer stupidity and dumb luck) they manage to somehow make it through the crisis only to face another yawner a few pages later. In between each crisis numerous years elapse so by the time Asimov sets up the next unrelated crises the entire cast of characters changes -- you barely have time to figure out their names much less get to know any person in significant detail.This series of books did nothing but put me to sleep on multiple occassions when normally if a book is good I'll stay up all night to finish it. My advice is to steer well clear from this series and try one of the other highly rated sci-fi books out there -- there are so many others that would be far preferable. ",1.0

It probably could have been rewritten replacing historical language instead of spacefare and it would not have mattered in the slightest.

" I have not read James Marcus' book 'Amazonia' but in a recent NPR interview he insisted that during his Amazon tenure he was never pressured to write positive reviews of things he found crappy. However Amazon's editorial review above makes me doubt such a claim. If the guy had said this movie is so bad that it's good I could accept that. But to suggest that 'Mean Guns' has redeeming qualities that anyone involved with it actually intended it to have? You've got to be kidding.Also do not believe the overall user rating for this movie or the low ratio of helpful to unhelpful votes that my review will inevitably get (assuming anyone ever actually reads it). Most people who have rated it are probably Christopher Lambert fans so they obviously have no taste. For anyone who realizes Lambert has less acting talent than a dead dog let me inform you that 'Mean Guns' is actually terrible. I will admit that I found it to be enjoyably bad -- the incompetence of everyone involved gave me a few pretty good laughs. But enjoyably bad is still bad. I will say this -- at least it was not nearly as horrible as the previous Pyun-Lambert project 'Adrenalin",1.0
" MEAN GUNS is a vile pointless movie with no redeeming qualities. The horrible acting of Ice T has never been so flagrantly evidenced as in this loser. He plays some kind of syndicate lord who assembles all these people who have somehow betrayed the syndicate (this includes for no apparent reason a vampire?). Armed with not only guns but baseball bats the movie is one long let's see how many people we can kill in ninety minutes. The murders are offensively brutal and with a plot that limps along one has to wonder why this movie was even made. How can we root for anyone when they are all heartless cold-blooded killers? Christopher Lambert the stone faced hero of B movies even brings along his little daughter to wait in the car while the murders go on. The movie tries to embrace some kind of code of honor among murderers but is there honor among these low lifes? One female actress who plays Barbie is so obnoxious I couldn't wait for her to meet her demise and it takes a long time to happen too. With an ending that is so forced and implausible MEAN GUNS is one mean film and that doesn't mean you should watch it if you know what I Mean. ",1.0

" As I say don't make the mistake of buying this overpriced dvd. I unfortunately did buy it and what I found was abysmal.Instead of the original Australian actor's voices there are nowpoorly dubbed American voices. I also noticed this version has been cut in certain scenes. I remember one scene in particular near the biginning. The couple who are later attacked by the biker gang are having sex in a field - one of the good guys appears watching them from a distance and shouts over to them. This scene appeared before the first chase scene and is missing from this version.The transfer appears to be a transplant from a poor quality laserdisc version and the sound is in mono.What appalled me was the American dubbing - this seems typically arrogant and ignorant to me. In any other country in the world you would not find this and its unfair and condescending to the portion of Americans who wanted to see the 'unbutchered' Australian version. I have seen this dubbing in the States with English programmes as well (leaving the evil characters with the English accents of course) and its frankly offensive to watch.DON'T BUY THIS DVD - WAIT FOR SOMETHING BETTER TO BE RELEASED!

" When I purchased my HP Z560 Digital Entertainment Center it was going to be where I stored all my music and video so I could access it from any computer in my house on my home network. It was going to be the computer that I used to take care of working with all my digital entertainment. What a let down! This thing does not do much of what it says. First there is a big problem with the video card and the display set up. I swear that the NVIDIA graphics card they put in this unit is incompatible with the rest of the system. I think it would be better off with a different card. They say it will work like a TIVO. It will as long as you don't try to pause the program you are watching and recording. If you do the unit will freeze up and your recording is done. Try to record from a set top or disc and it won't let you.To make a long story short and to quit raising my blood pressure about this unit again. It makes a good desktop computer although fairly slow and antiquated. Try to use it as a media center computer and you will definitely be sorry and disappointed. The personal media device you can get for the computer is kind of nice but not worth buying the computer for. Buy it seperate from HP if you want it. I can not believe that HP put something so junky and glitch ridden on the market. I paid $1600.00 for the unit and it is a POS.

There is no imagination or inspiration here no sense of even an attempt to make the music their own.

" The Jean Claude Van Damme Review Matrix (JCVD-RM)1. Who is he? Andrei a knife throwing KGB agent sent by the Russians to steal the top secret U.S. equipment2. Which family member/friend must be avenged? This early in JCVD's career the mandatory paint-by-numbers plot pieces like this were not in place yet.3. Does he take his shirt off? Half of the movie is on a ship in the water. You think he'd miss the chance for some rays?4. Does he have sex with a C-List actress? JCVD goes for a little anonymous redhead in this one.5. Is there a tournament? Perhaps if a race is sport and all tournaments are sport maybe it's a tournament. Otherwise it's just the Americans versus the Russians6. Is training needed for this tournament? Only acting training7. Does he do the splits in training or in the tournament? This may be the only movie in which a character not only does the splits while wearing a suit and a tie but he also does it in khakis.8. Does he punch someone in the balls? To be honest I can't say I remember it happening. However given the fact that I dozed off during several scenes it's entirely possibly that JCVD performed a fistectomy.9. Does he do a series of flying or 360 kicks? In every single fight.10. Is his enemy unbeatable? Hardly. He's just a little Asian guy with big hair and a black belt.11. Does he overcome an injury or other hindrance? Aside from being a Belgian acting as a Russian and speaking in broken English...not really.12. Does he win? It doesn't matter - the viewer loses.Some planes go down over the Mediterranean and three were carrying top secret laser guidance systems. The rest is a race to get them before the Russians. Somehow a Japanese guy codenamed 'Black Eagle' goes in for the United States and a Belgian guy goes in for the Russians. And that's probably the movie's biggest problem; it's nearly incomprehensible the majority of the time because of various language barriers that aren't overcome.A fan of JCVD action or good movies will be severely disappointed. He's barely in the movie and the rest is just bad. When you begin to crave the acting talents of JCVD then you know the rest of the movie is slop. This is definitely a blemish on his career; I'm just not sure if it's wart or a zit. ",1.0
" Now don't take this into the wrong direction. I like Van Damme as well as Sho Kosugi but even they couldn't save this film from being so boring and so abysmal. I was so bored by this film that not only did I fall asleep during the film I couldn't even finish the thing.An F-11 holding a device that the United States government cannot afford to lose crash lands in the Mediterranean. The KGB lead by Andrei (Played by Van Damme) unfortunately are much closer to finding the device than the CIA. The United States government decides to send in their best man Ken Tani The Black Eagle (Played by Kosugi). Tani decides to head to Malta with his two kids (Played by Kosugi's own children) to find the device before the KGB does.I have nothing else to say about this crap except that even if you're a Van Damme superfan don't bother and just leave it in the $3 bin at BigLots!

" As a molecular biologist & a HUGE red sox fan I was very excited to see how Polidoro handled the controversy associated with his subject. Well he didn't... in the story as he presented it there was no controversy with the exception of a few animal rights activists. Are you kidding me?!? The entire story was unbelievable baseless naive and repetitive. On top of that it was also incredibly poorly written. Which brings me to the question I ask in my review title. Did anyone edit this book? The dialog was cringe-worthy the story flowed horribly and there were numerous grammatical errors. Not to mention the huge errors in timeline continuity! My favorite involved a character telling her husband that she's just found out that she's pregnant and attributes it to a sex act that took place over 8 months earlier in the story. How does an editor not catch that? All in all it's typical of a book by someone who has what could be a very interesting topic but thinks that all you need to do to write a good book is put together a happy ending story and randomly plop in a bunch of lame pop culture historical and geographical references (what do the swans in the public garden have to do with anything??)

Due to the size and shape of the fan blades no air comes out of the center of the fan; what little breeze there is comes out in a small stream on the sides of the fan. I won't comment on the light since I wasn't interested it that option. Just got it and I am sending it right back. ",1.0

" This book is so boring that doctors should recommend it to those with insomnia because it'll put you right to sleep. Billed as an erotic book of essays it did not succeed with its task.The author seems to dwell in his promiscuity but bores us with stories about his furniture and odd stains on his upholstery instead of telling us how those stains got there.In another essay he tells of his dying lover in the hospital and the last time they performed together then at the funeral his lover's nurse comes to tell him that he was 'with' the lover several times--and the author thought that was comforting. Yet there were no details of any of these couplings.There is a point when trying to write erotica intelligently which I am all for that the writer inadvertantly eradicates all hints of passion and heat. The author completely leaves his readers cold and unmoved and still not in the mood which is unfortunate. This book could have been very steamy and still maintained its dignity had the writer moved into the scenes and relived the physicality of his sessions. But no we are to read about distant memories that have no feeling or touch attached.Instead of this book being labeled and marketed as erotica it should have been listed as autobiographic...and if these are the highlights of a life I feel sorry for the subject--how can one lead a life so boring?

This is another reason not to buy at the Amazonif you are not sure about the item. Buy your local store and return it when products disppointed in you. I had few cheap rice cookers couldn't keep rice warm at least it dosen't make rice dry and porridge at same time. Don't buy this products.

" I bought this because it was recommended by Cook's Illustrated and I've had excellent results from most of their recommendations. Not so with this one. I have major issues with the unit's cleanability. The lid is hinged and is not removable for easy cleaning. The inside of the lid had a scale on it after cooking and I was hesitant to clean it thoroughly because it seemed to be something of a mystery substance and I was afraid that I would scratch it. There is a trough that catches condensation and is also difficult to clean. Likewise with the extremely flimsy gasket. The unit took longer to clean properly than it did to make the rice and I prefer the old Aroma rice cooker that I bought this to replace. ",1.0

" I was neither satisfied with the product nor the 'shopping experience' for this product. I specifically wanted this to cook brown rice as we are trying to eat healthier. It tends to get scorched on the stove top plus takes a long time (not so long in hindsight). I talked to friends who had a rice cooker (not this brand) that they were happy with and then I read the reviews on Amazon and other sites. This cooker apparently was rated highly by Cook's magazine and was reasonably priced. Since most of the negative reviews seemed to be about ease of cleaning I thought it would work out. It seems to only be available online either from Amazon or Walmart (online only). The day it arrived I read the directions thoroughly (some reviewers mentioned that measurements need to be fairly precise) and followed them. The manual mentioned that white rice would be ready in about 30 minutes but did not mention how long it took for brown rice to cook though it had some suggested recipes. I just cooked basic brown rice in a small quantity. Well it took one and a half hours for it to be done and it was quite soggy. I was not willing to keep the item and 'tweak' the process to try to get decent rice so I cleaned it up and repacked it and checked on the return process. Since this item was not handled by Amazon directly I had to contact the company that sent the product with an email and wait for them to approve my reason for returning it and give me a return authorization code to include with my packaging. They did approve the return and I sent it back via UPS. It cost me over 17 dollars for the return shipping (not anthing expedited just regular UPS that was supposed to take about 10 days for it to reach the destination). I tracked the package until it reached the seller and then waited for my refund. When a month had passed and still no refund I called them to let them know. They did respond quickly after my call for me to get a refund. However I will never purchase an item like this from Amazon again especially if it's through another seller. Books and CD's are fine but no appliances. ",1.0

When I called the company to ask about service or an exchange I got someone one time.

It is not worth my time to keep trying to get a hold of someone pay to send it to a service person etc. Since this item is well reviewed in Cook's Illustrated I am debating buying another and crossing my fingers...

I have other PIAA products and though I like them when they work I have yet to have more then 3 years of trouble free use.

I actually came to Amazon to see what others said about it after struggling to understand the logical errors I thought I was coming across. Here's a nice but rather obvious example",1.0
" This book has a different approach of studying for the GRE Chemistry exam. Instead of spoonfeeding you all the correct answers to the questions it gives you all the wrong information so that you will be forced to think if every single item is correct or not. Since Chemistry is a very strict subject meaning if one atom or bond is misplaced everything becomes invalid reading the book becomes a tedious experience rather than an enriching experience. It is very sad that the Princeton publishers did not even bother to proofread the book and if they ever even bother it is most likely for grammatical purposes rather than for the Chemistry content. I have written to the Princeton publishers reagarding this issue and all they can say is they are very sorry that I am disappointed. Do you think that is enough compensation to the disappointment I have regarding this book? I have heard that they are planning to release a new edition. Honestly with this kind of previous editions I would discourage anybody to buy this book. I think it would be more effective if you just stick to your old textbooks. ",1.0

If you are looking to study for the GRE I recommend picking up the Harcourt Brace College Outline Series books on College Chemistry and Physical Chemistry if you haven't already.

However it does keep you on your toes and constantly running to your text books to double check facts. I'm not sure if that is a good thing though... Come test time it wouldn't be hard to become confused between what is right and what you saw in the book. A much better review book would be Schaum's Outlines but they are much more detailed and not as general. This is both good and bad.

" This book based on limited family input collected circa 1856 then written after all of John Mercier McMullen's siblings were deceased in 1902 has been proven by his genetic male descendants based on DNA testing and extensive genealogical research to have been a political fabrication. It was not published in 1902 or following his death in 1908 by any surviving male relations of John M McMullen including his own sons. Rather it was a maternal grandaughter who published it in 1960. His motivation in modifying fabricating or in several cases actually eliminating truthful information appears to have been a desire for acceptance by the British aristocracy of the day in his Upper Canadian village of Brockville. This resulted in an effort by John McMullen to position his historical family as pro-UBE anti Irish and of lowland Scot extraction. The facts suggest exactly the opposite with oral history as provided by sibling descendants genetic DNA test results and actual interviews with Irish families in the village of Kells Co. Kilkenny (where John came from not the north of Ireland) who knew this family as late as 1950. An example of fabrication would be his statement that James McMullen was one of the 13 apprentices of Derry exposed as a falsehood in correspondence with the association itself.

" Tom Lehrer once said that political satire died the day Henry Kissinger was given the Nobel Peace Prize. Thus it is with cinematic satire as this film won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. There is no story of any worth here. It adds nothing to our understanding of the human condition (which other reviewers seem to imply is where its value lies) per se it is merely a series of sketches in search of a coherent theme which fails qua entertainment. McKellan and Redgrave do their best but with such prosaic material to work off they cannot save a very boring film whose raison d'etre escapes the ever increasing somnolent viewer. That it won an Oscar for the screenplay says far more about the Academy's often appalling decisions than anything else. Perhaps like the American Presidency lobby money can buy anything. ",1.0

" James Whale is an old deceprit man. He has lived a life of fame thanks to his direction of the first two Frankenstein movies. When Whale begins trying to sketch his new gardener Clay Boone memories of his past begin to flood his mind. Boone eventually finds out that Whale is homosexual. While this makes him uneasy he returns over and over again. The film follows their strange relationship.One of the problems I have with this movie is the fact that it focuses entirely on Whale's sexual preference. Are viewers not supposed to care about anything else besides his homosexuality? Because I do.Also the relationship between Boone and Whale is a perpetually bizarre one. Despite how uncomfortable he sometimes becomes when in Whale's presence Boone cannot keep himself away. I found it quite unbelievable.Lastly this movie is incredibly monotonous. Nothing really interesting occurs until the last thirty minutes.Near the end James asks Clay 'Do you believe people come into our lives for a purpose?' Well I believe that all films should have a purpose whether that be to make people laugh cry or ponder. This one simply doesn't. ",1.0

" This is an incomplete 1902 translation of Prus' classic historical novel 'Pharaoh.' (It is missing the author's stunning Epilog which was restored only later from the original manuscript.)The translator Jeremiah Curtin demonstrates an abysmally poor understanding of the original text's Polish language and an equally poor grasp of English style. His primitive knowledge of the book's subject matter and his inept wooden inaccurate translation--it contains some real howlers--help explain the novel's limited appreciation until recently among English-language readers.

" Two weeks ago I purchased this Black and Decker product from my local CVS store in California. Brand-new out of the package it wouldn't work. I felt reassured that at least it had a two year warranty and was a 'name brand' of Black and Decker. I was shocked when I phoned the Black and Decker service center in Texas the 800-544-6986 that was included with the warranty info ...and they told me that since the item had been manufactured three years earlier (there was a 2007 date-sticker on product) and since this product had been discontinued by Black and Decker they could not honor the warranty for repair or replacement.I informed the Black and Decker service-center manager [Anita] that it was not legal for Black and Decker to claim 'no responsibility' for their warranty and they couldn't refuse to honor their warranty just because they discontinued the item (particularly because I had just purchased it two weeks prior & had my receipt). She then gave me a local Black and Decker service-center phone number in California where the representative ('Dave') informed me that because the item was discontinued by Black and Decker 'I was out of luck' and there was nothing they could do. It was just suggested I return the item to the store.Beware consumers! Black and Decker is setting new precedents in skirting their legal responsibilities regarding honoring their product-warranties. It seems that since the volume of complaints are so high regarding Black and Decker products not much attention is being paid to this negligence on Black and Decker's part (and who has the time and money to bring a 'breach of warranty' case to court for a $50. item?)After this experience I will never again have confidence in the Black and Decker name and I urge you to consider researching consumer-complaints about this company's customer-service before purchasing Black and Decker products.Tom in Encinitas California ",1.0

" Nathaniel Philbrick has written a research paper and had it published as a novel. The book has 302 pages which includes 64 pages of notes bibliography acknowledgements and index.The story is interesting and worth the read but one thing that struck me as odd in the authors referral to the black members of the ship's crew as 'African Americans'. Keep in mind that this story occurred in 1820. I hardly think that the use of the politically correct term African American was even conceived at that time. The author also seems to want to build the case that because the black members of the crew were the first to die that there may have been racial reasons for this to occur. He discusses the difference in body fat content between blacks and whites and the closeness of the Nantucket Quakers which may have accounted for the whites being treated differently while trying to survive at sea. The possibility of racism is raised a couple of times but then quickly dismissed.I would recommend that unless you have a burning desire to read this book immediately that you wait for the paper back edition.

It could not even recognize one of the many I can see in my wifi selection list. This was not a matter of the password being needed. It simply did not recognize the presence of a wireless network.I checked the connection to the USB port and followed all the troubleshooting suggestions on the DVR screen as well as the TiVo website.I wasted 2 hours on the phone with a TiVo tech support guy. He wanted me to open ALL the ports of my router and a few other things. I have an Apple AirPort networs and a Lynksys network as well. The tech support people at both manufacturers had no idea.I finally gave up. I connected my TiVo directly to the internet with an ethernet connector. Since I have only one internet modem and hence use only one wireless router I have to manually connect the TiVo every couple of days and let it download the programming data. Then I reconnect the ethernet cable to my wireless router so I can have internet connection available for my computers.If the TiVo USB wireless adapter worked I could have constant internet connectivity to my TiVo making it a much better DVR.As it is I have TiVo which I love without the many enhanced functions I wanted.

My laptop easily achieves 12Mbps without a hitch.For a goof we moved the wireless router and modem to the kitchen table and hooked it up to the laptop.

" We received our Baby Born doll today and quickly got our son to distract our daughter so that we could get a quick peak at her Christmas present. At first we thought the doll was adorable. However after our daughter went to bed we got it out of the packaging before wrapping it (it is one of our pet peeves to spend Christmas morning wrestling with wires and cardboard) and attempted to discover all of its 'functions.' Supposedly it 'squeals with delight.' I kept looking for some way to make this baby do something -- anything -- and then my husband took it and forcefully squeezed its left arm and finally a pitiful squeak came out. It is not a 'squeal of delight' but more like a dog toy squeak. Not only that but no 38 pound girl could muscle up the strength to make this doll squeak. It came with two tubes and no directions as to where to put these tubes. I have edited anatomy textbooks so I'm not dumb as far as where the possible orifices might be! There was just no logical explanation for these strange tubes that we could find even after reading every single piece of paperwork. So tossing the tubes aside we tried to give her water. It leaked out of her neck (no surprise what with the missing tubes). We packaged the entire sham back up and really really hope that they give us our money back -- minus the shipping charge. What a scam. We are hoping for better luck with Corelle.

When sitting in camp not even a particularly high camp at that climbers help one another. The summit is the goal but it is not what is most important. Ms. Koncour could not find the time to help out a climber who was in need of medical attention because she was busy clearing snow from her tent something she did every few hours. she could not help this wretched soul? Remember she is only at 13000 feet. While this may sound high it really is not. Conditions in a storm of the magnitude experienced that half week on denali are not fun but the situation is not like K@ or Everest where medical help and resupply may be an impossobility depending on ones altitude. THe height that Ms Koncour refers too is still well within range of airplane and helicopter support.

They were 'trapped' at the 14200' camp on Denali in a severe storm that claimed 11 lives in May of 1992. The 14200' camp is as large as any k-Mart parking lot and just as flat. The idea of 'clinging' to the mountain from this camp is ridciulous. The camp had a ranger hut staffed by park service rangers and volunteers as well as a medical station. I am sure that their stay there was uncomfortablebut far from life threatening. The author attempts to exaggerate her own situation at the expense of those who were truly in danger on the mountain and those who died there. Her attraction to a body bag containing the remains of a man who died at the 14200' camp (of natural causes) was ghoulish and nauseating. She put me in mind of the rear echelon soldier who presents second hand stories of the horrors of war as his own. The author claims that on 'the mountain' the other climbers called her 'The Woman'. I would venture to guess that her team mates called her a lot of other things as well. In summary the Author attempted to portray a professionally guided climb on the easiest busiest route on Mt. McKinley as something much more than it was and did so at the expense of others. *Note to the editor* Orizabo is not the second highest peak in North America. Mt. Logan is much higher and far more difficult. Talkeetna is about 70 miles from Denali not 250 as stated over and over in the book ",1.0
" One unfortunate outgrowth of the success of excellent climber/writers such as Jon Krakauer Greg Child and Bill Sherwonit is the publication of books such as Facing the Extreme which seek to capitalize on the sudden interest in human suffering in the mountains. Facing the Extreme by Ruth Anne Kocour and Michael Hodgson is filled with many seemingly small factual errors which in the end add up and made me question Ms. Kocour's journalistic credibility (though she is not a journalist by trade it is still her responsiblity as an author to get it right). Though not a factual error in the Author's Note Ms. Kocour tells us that she has changed the names of her fellow climbers (with the exception of the guides) as she cannot '...speak for them or tell their story'. What she dosen't come right out and tell you is that her portrayal of her fellow climbers is focused almost entirely on both their personal and mountaineering shortfalls. If we are to believe Ms. Kocour she was the toughest mentally and physically the most skilled and the person with the fewest personality shortcomings. After elevating herself she clearly had no choice but to change the names of her fellow climbers. My biggest problem with Facing the Extreme comes with the obvious lack of fact checking. Ms. Kocour states that Talkeetna is 70 miles from Anchorage when it is approximately 114 miles. She also tells us that Denali is 250 miles from Talkeetna and the single engine Cessna made the flight to Denali Base Camp in 40 minutes an obvious impossiblity. Denali is actually only 60 miles by road from Talkeetna. In addition there are serious climbing factual errors as well all the more shocking considering Ms. Kocour's oft repeated (in the text anyway) expertise. Ms. Kocour claims that while camped at high camp at 17200 feet the climbers had now entered the 'death zone'. Actually the 'death zone' as it is known to climbers begins at approximately 26000 feet nearly 9000 feet higher than high camp on Denali. In fact Base Camp on Mount Everest where climbers spend close to 2 months at a time is at approximately 17700 feet some 500 feet higher that high camp on Denali. Ms. Kocour also states that she '...had been to 23000 feet on Aconcagua' difficult to do since Aconcagua is 22841 feet high a seemingly small error but an important distiction to climbers. If you want to spend money reading books by female climbers/explorers I suggest The Climb of my Life by Laura Evans or Artic Daughter by Jean Aspen. ",1.0
" I really wanted to like this book. Most climbing accounts are written by superstars of the sport. Ms. Kocour's book held promise of an honest account of an amateur 'weekend warrior'. The struggle of a group of amateur climbers thrown together to climb Denali has all the elements of a superb human drama. Unfortunately the depiction of the human spirit is perhaps the Mt. Everest of writing and Ms. Kocour is not an Everest climber - in either the mountaineering or the literary sense. Her character development is one-dimensional at best. The guides are all-wise guardian angels whose cosmic connection to the mountain is boringly infallible. Her fellow clients are either hapless bumblers or selfish dolts who would run off in panic were it not for the heroic presence of the author. Ms. Kocour's dialogue is downright silly. She apparently equates crudity with authenticity which perhaps accounts for her preoccupation with the many ways to defecate and urinate on the mountain. Upon her deliverance off the mountain she gushes to her guide 'You did a great job of leading - a tribute to your family's storied mountaineering and guiding history'. Do you think she really said that? Do you talk that way? Ms. Kocour compounds the problem by trying to portray her trip (and her role in it) as an astonishing mountaineering feat which it was not. Sure there was a bad storm but while Ms. Kocour was spending several chapters admiring her own ability to sit in the tent waiting for her guides to cook her dinner Park Service rangers and mountain rescue personnel were out in the teeth of the storm working to help climbers. Their presence is barely acknowledged. Climbing Denali on a guided trip is a tremendous physical and mental challenge and Ms. Kocour is right to be proud of it. However her trip should not be confused with a right of passage to 'serious' mountaineering. Any reasonably fit individual with three weeks and a few thousand dollars can sign on with any one of several excellent guide services to be led up the West Buttress of Denali. Hundreds of people do it every year. Ms. Kocour's very accomplished guides told the clients when to get up what to carry what direction to go and where to camp. The customers including Ms. Kocour followed their guide every day tied in line to a rope. To assert as Kocour does that being led up the West Buttress of Denali along with two or three hundred other people qualifies her to climb Everest is the sort of hubris that has contributed to so many deaths on that mountain. All in all this is just a bad book. It could have been the story of an individual's triumph over her own limits. Instead it was a tiresome tribute by the author to herself. Were it not for the mass market success of Jon Krakauer's Everest account this book would have been rightly relegated to the bargain bin. I won't even start on the editing ",1.0

" I hate when historical dramatizations treat facts in so frivolously fictitious a fashion that one ends up wondering why the thing was ever made. Why invent when any given reality is ever so more precious?I don't know all that much about Brummell (and learned very little about him in this flick) but I do about Byron. To perfidiously suggest that Lord Byron played a large part in bringing Brummell down is what is truly scandalous in this silly telling. Scrope Davis Byron's life-long friend was a crony of Brummell's - but Byron's interplay with Brummell is marginal if even that. Yet even beyond the slanderous suggestions of Byron's dissolute and desultory effects on this biopic's supposedly charming hero there is the matter of Matthew Rhys attempting to step into Byron's boots one of which was fashioned for a lame leg. Simply put if the historical Lord Byron was anything at all like the one portrayed in this film no women would have swooned and fainted when he entered a room (and if they had it would have been out of fright!) nor would they have scrambled across continents to 'unphilosophize' him. Unlike the actual Byron who was according to one of his innumerable lovers famously judged 'mad bad and dangerous to know' - Rhys is well just 'bad.' And NOT in a 'good' way! It hardly helps matters that he looks more like a cross twixt the young Steven Spielberg and the young Barbra Streisand than one of the most beautiful faces of the day.But apart from Byron if one knew hardly anything whatsoever about Beau Brummel about a quarter way in one might be wondering why in the world they were watching this film. It is minimal to an excessive degree. And apart from the Spartan script there is a truly threadbare feel to this entire undertaking. The whole story is alloted a few cramped sets - and no sense of the true style of the era is conveyed. I also understand that the modernistic music score is supposed to hint at Brummell's futuristic sense of style and all ('the dashing designer of modern dress - and disgrace') it says on the DVD cover - yet the music isn't great - it merely grates. And even though people came from far and wide to watch our fashion-plate hero dress I highly doubt if he permitted them to watch him attire himself from a ballsy state of complete nudity.In short I wasted money on this one money I could have placed on a number at the nearest gaming table. ",1.0
" I wanted to know more about how Beau Brummell influenced fashion and hygiene. The movie hardly covered these important aspects. It focused more on Brummell's debts and gambling. I wanted to know how people reacted when he walked into a ballroom or drawing room when he did not wear high heels a powdered face or wig. I wanted to know how people reacted to his darker colors and simpler masculine less-effeminate style. How long did it take to change men's fashion? Brummell made a courageous statement in fashion and yet there was no grandiose cinematic show of it. There was one scene where gentlemen came to watch him dress but there was little explanation as to why they would waste their time. Wigs and perfume were all used to mask the lack of bathing and yet there was no significant statement of the change Brummell enacted. How did he convince men to bathe more often and how did he influence the importance of personal hygiene for both men and women? There was more to be told of the story and the movie failed. ",1.0

" This pocket size book attempts to teach the reader basic phrases and sentences in Danish by printing them phonetically in English. This is a great concept- but instead of spelling things foe-net-ik-lee they use all of those annoying symbols that one generally finds in a pronunciation key at the begining of an american dictionary (the upside down and backwards e the little lines over an a or an e etc. for example). So unless you are an English major and understand the meaning of these american language symbols- you will never understand this book.

When the band broke up i was upset and i felt that the void would not be filled. When i heard Omar was fronting The mars volta i knew he would stay true to experimental music and indeed i was correct.I can not say the same for Sparta how ever i find that Cedric's vocals are often flat and they sound more like an unexperienced singer. Their music falls short maybe more production could be used to beef up the songs. I find comparing the mars volta to sparta an unfair comparision.

" If you're looking for a true 'collection' of some funny Stooge moments it's best to buy the Sony pictures chronological series.

If you did you would find this laughable and cheesy beyond words as well! It sounds to me like some christian guys who heard of but never listened to thrash metal decided to have a go at it. The result is an awful combination of uninspired cheesy rock & roll riffs that are even bluesy at times layered with some hilariously awful vocals. I mean the vocals are just ridiculous! And what's with the cover of Deep Purple's Space Truckin? The guitar tones are weak the drummer doesn't seem like he knows what he's doing and the song writing is just plain BAD. They really do sound like posers. Try giving this to some hardcore metalhead. I dare you. Prepare to have it shoved up your nose! If you're planning on being a witness through music you better have a freakin clue! I know alot of people respect Vengance for being 'pioneers' of Christian extreme Metal but that doesn't excuse the EXTREME lack of quality in their music. ",1.0

I installed the one speaker and before I installed the second one I decided to try it out. Not only did it sound terrible but it blew within five minutes.

" Plan 9 from Outer Spacewas an Oscar-winning performance compared to this dread of Hollywood. Actually I'm a gigantic fan of 'Plan 9' but I could find nothing whatever here to whet my usual fancy for almost all of the older black-and-white horror films.From the opening credits (which was reminiscent of some minor reprobate holding a cheesily scribed piece of poster board because it sort of 'moves around') I sensed that this one wasn't going to make my Hit Parade. Then in the very first scene the viewer is hilariously treated to a gal (who was ugly enough prior to make-up) who's wearing a pair of those paraffin buck teeth that we use to buy at the candy store back in the 50s for a nickel punctuated with the furry eyebrows of mouse-hair rivaling those of Martin Scorcese on a bad hair day.The devastating uppercut came with a performance by Page Cavanaugh and His Trio which the director clearly viewed as a big plus for his film. I'm inclined to not share his enthusiasm for that threesome of un-renowned musical geeks.I realize that this is 'troubled youth in the '50s Drive-in' fare and the movie should be viewed tongue-in-cheek... but an aardvark doesn't have enough tongue for this one. Of course it features bad acting a moronic script marginal camera work and all the rest. But that's not why I especially hated it.Here's what you will not find in this film",1.0
" Alright folks. This is one of those films. Adjust the rating depending on your preference. If your looking for a GOOD Horror movie than apply the one star review. If your a masochist and/or a bad film nut than give this a full five star review!Frankenstein's Daughter(1958) was the brain child of Director Richard Cunhaa director who could have given Ed Wood a run for his money as he directed some of the most hilariously awful Horror pictures of the 1950s including She Demons(1957) Giant From the Unknown(1957) and Missle to the Moon(1958).The idea for this film must have sprang from the idea that since Frankenstein already had a son(Universal's 1939 'Son of Frankenstein' which was a GOOD film) why not make a film about his daughter? Well Cunha and his writers made the same age old mistake of confusing the doctor's name with the Monsters'. So instead of a Crazy foxy female scientist we get what is supposed to be the female Monster of yet another insane male scientist in the family.This Frankenstein is played by Donald Murphy in one of the hammiest mad scientist roles of all time. Murphy's Frankenstein is a lecherous megalomaniac creep who likes to hit on young hot jail bait which he either drugs them with a serum that makes there faces look like a bad halloween mask or run over them with his car which after there curvy voluptous figures are magically transformed to resemble that of a muscle bound man!Murphy plays the role to the hilt and it's a shame that his supporting cast does not share the same enthusiasm.John Ashley does his best Wooden Indian impression as a hapless boyfriend of Sandra Knightwho is equally bad. Knight only amuses when popping out of her tight black bathing suit. Veteran actor Felix Locher may have been the worst elderly actor of the period hamming it up to a degree that would shame even Murphy's eye rolling!This film features many of the most unintentionally funny moments in genre history including the horrendous make-up designed for the Monster which according to Hollywood Legend WAS supposed to be a sexy female Monster but instead(and quite improbally) became hulking actor Harry Wilson(!) who is not remotely attractive and/or female.Sandra Knight is briefly turned into a oatmeal faced Monster who runs around with her bathing suit on(!) causing a newspaper headline to describe a 'Bathing suited Monster on the Loose!'.The death scenes are CLASSIC bad cinema including some guy that gets crushed in a door(what is he shouting before the Monster crushes him? Is it 'Ma!'?) and the admittebly violent demise of Murphy's character who gets gruesomely scalded with acid by the worst miss in Hollywood history courtesy of Non-Hero John Ashley.I should probally also note that Harold Lloyd Jr. is in this film singing a very bad song and telling some terrible jokes not quite on par with his gifted father.And with that noteplease proceed at your own risk Movie Maniacs and enjoy this stinking piece of Trash cinema from the Golden age of the Drive In Movie.

" 'The Story of a Man of Character' as described by Thomas Hardy is somewhat flaccidly applied to this novel. In fact a better description of this novel comes from a colleague of mine Professor Neale Scott of the Baltimore University who remarked 'I realise now I had mistaken the dullness of Henchard's character for the dullness of the whole novel.'. Ultimately Prof. Scott is quite accurate in his assessment of the text. The characters bumble around waiting for circumstance to attach itself to their groins and do very little of plausible importance at all. Henchard himself is without doubt one of the most irritating characters to be placed in 'classic' fiction and one can't help but wish that the death of our tragic hero had happened an awful lot sooner such as before the novel started. The character of Elizabeth-Jane wonderfully parodied by Helli Kitchin of the Moscow State University is so blase towards her constantly changing parenthood that it completely ruins any sense of empathy that the audience may have for her. The least convincing Scotsman ever can also be found in this text in the form of Donald Farfrae and I am inclined to agree with Dr Daniel Greenfeld whose thesis 'Hardy makes the heart grow colder' points out that the author would not know a Scotsman if one jumped up and bit him a way that most of us admittedly meet them. To sum up - I discourage my students from reading this shambolic text. Avoid this novel like the plague - it is so soggy you couldn't even burn it to stay warm. Attempt perhaps to read something a little more plausible with something other that a praetorian wanderer and an intransigent hay-trusser to tantalise the imagination something that the author was obviously lacking - Wessex indeed.

" Modern novels can be so pretentious with their needless philosophizing and conscious experimentation with the language. So isn't nice to read a classic novel with straight-forward writing that aims for no insight into society or people? Actually no it's kind of depressing. The Mayor of Casterbridge relies on coincidence melodrama and as the afterword in my edition puts it 'the constant exploitation of chance happenings to determine situation and hence the fate of his characters.' I chose this Hardy novel because it was supposed to be character-centered. The story starts with Michael Henchard selling his wife and child at a fair. I thought this book would examine his redemption it would be a Lord Jim type tale of profound psychological insight. A strange event like that is a good way to get a book started but the crazy unlikely events just keep a-coming. You feel nothing for the characters ever. You learn nothing in the end except life is cruel and if something can go wrong it will. Read something else. ",1.0

But the worst is the entire chapter on fetal memories recovered with the aid of hypnotic or primal therapy.

" I was very disappointed overall with this book. In particular the misinformation perpetuated by this author in the section on diet and nutrition was shocking. The author advocates 'free range' and 'more natural' animal products in place of tested safe chicken and dairy products. As a veterinarian and graduate of The Ohio State University College of Food Agriculture and Environmental Sciences I can testify that the quality of such 'natural' products is often much lower than their farm-grown counterparts. Furthermore the agricultural processes decried by this author in fact serve to make our food supply safer than ever before. Certainly this book does not present an 'expert' opinion nor does it provide safe and accurate information for the women who need it most. As far as the rest of the information in this book I found it outdated and in other cases inaccurate. The author apparently has never been through a twin pregnancy herself; she is not particularly sensitive to the emotions of the mothers for whom the book is ostensibly written. ",1.0
" This book was originally written in 1980 and although a few chapters were added in 1991 it still reads like the early 80s - a time when a woman really could 'fail' childbirth! If you are looking for an excuse to gain 50-60 (or even 70!) lbs or an excuse to never drink another glass of milk (according to the author the idea that milk is good for you is just a myth propagated by the highly government subsidized dairy farmers) then this book could be for you. On the other hand if you're on bedrest considering using an epidural or even (gasp) a c-section this book will try to make you feel bad about it.Then there are the chapters about the long term psychological effect of having to share a womb. If you believe as the author does that you can remember back to the day you implanted as a little embryo in your mothers womb then you might think there's something to this. I just had to laugh.The author cites a lot of conflicting studies about twins and draws whatever conclusions she wants from them. All in all I didn't get any of the practical advise I was looking for. ",1.0
" I've read most of this book and the more I've read the more bizarre it is. Noble claims that hypertension anemia and gestational diabetes are natural aspects of pregnancy that can be harmful if treated.

She implies that those carrying multiples many years ago gave birth to healthy 7-lb each infants with none of the problems that some of us having multiples face today. She is an advocate for veganism water births home births doulas and midwives and avoiding pain meds. Though my twins are big and healthy I certainly didn't take the advice in this book.This is not medically sound advice nor is it objective or open-minded. It is a book of extreme views. ",1.0
" This was the scariest book on twins that I read. If you want to be afraid to eat sleep or breathe during your entire pregnancy than this is your kind of book.

" Having just been told I was expecting twins I was keen to find a book that could give me the information and reassurance that standard 'singleton' pregnancy books could not. But instead of finding useful information and reassurance I finished this book feeling anxious and alarmed. It focuses far too much on the negative aspects of having twins - loss of one twin preterm labor birth complications vanishing twin syndrome etc. It is daunting enough being pregnant with twins without reading a book that reminds me of all the things that can go wrong. In addition the author offers impractical advice on nutrition and exercise which in many cases is contrary to advice from the medical profession. Not everyone has the money or the desire to eat seaweed and other 'macrobiotic' health store food. All in all I would not recommend this book to any woman expecting twins. It is alarmist and out-of-touch with real pregnant women. ",1.0
" I read this book right after I found out that I was having twins. Although I was a little concerned about the financial aspects of having two children I was very positive about having twins. This book absolutely scared me! Doom gloom and more doom! After reading it I thought that I would end up on bedrest early that my twins would end up in NICU for months and that all sorts of problems would come up. My husband and I later attended a childbirth class for multiple births and one of the first things that the instructor told us was to NOT read this book. There are so many other books out there that do tell you the risks and the problems but manage to stay positive. Incidentally I never was put on bedrest my girls were born at 36 weeks they spent one night in NICU and came home with me three days later. Believe me from talking to other moms of twins and my own experiences this is much more common than this book would make you believe. ",1.0
" I read this book while I was pregnant with my twin daughters and found it incredibly depressing and scary. It was filled with morbid quotes from parents who had a bad outcome along the lines of 'when not even one of the triplets lived I went out and got drunk' and seemed to dwell on every possible problem and complication to the point that I was quite stressed and anxious when in fact my twins were born naturally five days before the predicted due date had none of the complications this horrible book made me worry about and were in excellent health. In fact I so dislike the book that I go out of my way to warn expectant parents of twins to avoid it. In addition the dietary advice is ridiculous and it's impossible for even a hearty eater to consume the massive amounts of food this writer claims are necessary to having a healthy baby. So unless you like being scared I recommend against buying this book. ",1.0

" On their first three albums the Soft Machine were one of the real gems of the psychedelic and then progressive rock scene. Whereas far too many psychedelic bands tried to make it with vocalists who were quite unsuited to the sounds which they were aiming to make and many progressive bands could never play in such a manner as to attract attention the Soft Machine never fell prey to any of those problems. Their music always had a deep feeling to it and the vocals of Robert Wyatt and Kevin Ayers were always truly touching and at times even funny.OnThird the band with a new lineup changed tack completely but to no less effect on three of the sides. In doing so they provided part of the blueprint for such movements as the 1990s post-rock sound with fierce bass work and the unique saxophone playing of Elton Dean.However on the second side 'Slightly All the Time' there was some suggestion that the Soft Machine could lose the plot - and on 'Fourth' and 'Fifth' it is no understatement to say that they did so in a more dramatic manner than could ever have been imagined. Gone is the touching drumming of Wyatt and the intense bass lines that carried so much of 'Third' and in their place are sounds that could have come from almost any jazz-rock band and have utterly no emotional impact let alone the capacity to make a listener want to listen repeatedly. Elton Dean's saxophone work is even more prominent than it was on 'Slightly All the Time' but lacks the balance Hugh Hopper's fierce bass playing provided so wonderfully on 'Facelift' and 'Out-Bloody-Rageous'.Worse still is how the music on 'Fourth' and 'Fifth' seems to drift through a listener as if it were the worst kind of elevator music played with very little interruption. The saxophone sound is also so typical of the worst kind of 1970s jazz-rock as to be distinctly dated.All up this is a case of a band seemingly losing everything in one step just asThird Ear Banddid around the same time with theMacBeth soundtrack. Stick with their first three albums. ",1.0

" Also known as Trinity Rides Again/ La Collina degli stivali.The print of this 1969 Italian western film is very poor. Grainy and greenish sometimes. Right away you will notice that Terence Hill and Lionel Stander (A Star Is Born [1937] Hart To Hart tv series [1979-84] Hart To Hart tv-movies [1993-96] ) have their voices dubbed by someone else. Sometimes you hear Stander's real voice. Stander plays a circus ringmaster. With his assistance he will help Terence and Bud Spencer take down the bad guys in the west. Difficult film to enjoy without Terence Hill's real voice. Victor Buono also in the film. ",1.0

" Without a doubt this has to be most boring apocalyptic zombie horror book I have ever had the misfortune to read.The story starts off promising enough with an unknown virus which kills millions and nicely introdcues us to the characters but thats where it ends. The rest of the story is taken up with them finding somewhere to live and going out for supplies.The author does a good job of trying to convey the shock and disbelief of surviving such an event but it is overdone. 200 pages into a book I dont want the characters still sitting around in a state of shock.It seems as if David Moody started to write the first few chapters which evolved into a whole book but the early chapters never ended.At no point did I care about any of the characters because they were two dimensional. We learnt very little of their back stories so I never connected with them.Now onto the zombies OMG without doubt these are the most unscary monsters I have ever come across. They dont do anything but walk around and bumb into things. Its obvious that the trio are never really in danger from them. I also find it hard to believe that in todays world if you saw the dead rising and walking around the word zombie would not pop into your head but it seems as if the protagnists in the book are oblivious to the fact that these dead people are indeed zombies.Save your money and buy World War Z.

But that's it.The writing is poor the pacing is snail-like slow and the characters are just blah. The dialogue is often repeated with dozens of pages dedicated to the",1.0
" Autumn isn't a zombie novel. That's something you'll have to figure out pretty quickly. Sure there are corpses that get up wander around and bump into things but that's really about all they do for over half the book. Instead the focus is on a group of three completely unlikable (and frankly hard to keep track of because they all talk exactly the same way) 'survivors' whose names I won't even bother mentioning.Essentially the premise is that a virus sweeps the world (I assume) randomly killing...well just about everyone. The few left (in the unidentified 'English' city this story takes place in about thirty people out of half a million are left unaffected) band together at a community center with flimsy walls (this exposition is set up rather ludicrously early on and there's not even a pay off) the dead start rising and people start to panic. Unfortunately it's really hard to figure out why everyone immediately goes into survival mode (people panic at the site of a mob of undead only to learn they've simply gotten themselves hung up on a parked car) since the zombies while obviously dead aren't initially any more deadly than the average pot head or dementia patient. They shuffle around and bump into things they freeze up whenever anyone touches them etc. The irrational level of fear people have for them would seem to indicate people have been watching BBC's midnight zombie flick marathon except no one ever seems to make the zombie connection (Moody apparently subscribes to the theory that zombie fiction is best when the word zombie never appears). While I don't really care what you call the undead (be it skels Deadites zombies Darkseekers or whatever) I at least a reason for everyone to be afraid of them.For over half of its over 300 page length we get a series of repetitive sequences that don't really move the plot along all the while mobile corpses (it seems to cheat the term to call them zombies or even undead) wander around in the shadows. True scenes of zombies in the distance do make for an eerie atmosphere (Resident Evil Apocalypse and Dawn of the Dead's far superior remake manage this beautifully) but since for most of Autumn that's all the dead even do it quickly stops being scary (at least for me if not the characters themselves) and starts just being loopy.Let's talk about the characters themselves. Autumn has quite a large cast of them all of whom Moody seems to feel duty bound to name but none of whom really matter. There are however three main survivors. One man has lost his wife and daughter (his only unique feature and one which Moody will keep pounding into us long after it gets old) another man (who I really can't remember anything at all about and I gave up on this book yesterday over 150 pages in) and a woman whose response to this nightmare at first was to simply crawl into bed pull up the covers and wish everything would go away. There are a host of tertiary characters as well such as the man in the first chapter who succumbs to the plague (since he never comes back as a zombie it seems rather pointless to have this scene at all since we get not one but about a dozen similar scenes through the eyes of our survivors) another man who starts off looking for a gas station and quickly reveals himself to be a massive prick two rather pointless old women two equally pointless young women (who both sob a lot) and several others who are fortunately only present briefly only to be eaten off screen when the extremely flimsy building they all stupidly took shelter in ('I can push the walls apart!' announces a main character rather pointlessly early on which terrifies the others for no reasons since there's no danger from outside at this point and is to foreshadowing what a three year-old's finger painting is to Monet). We knew this was going to happen the minute our three main characters left the only problems with the scene are how badly it's set up and the fact that it all occurs off page (including the aftermath) meaning we don't even get to see the results of the suddenly not friendly zombies as they devour everyone. This is frankly a shame since the long and plodding scenes leading up to this deserve SOME sort of pay-off but they really don't ever get any as is the case with this novel as a whole.It's hard to keep the characters straight mainly because they have such a narrow range of personality",1.0
" I would think that the technical ability to write would be a minimum requirement for an author and having a compelling story would be key to publishing a novel. Worst case an editor can fix the former but the lack of the latter spells doom.

Oh and here's a tip you don't need to refer to the three main charcters by their first name in every scene.

" I have to say man I agree with the 'Boring' guy! Not to mention the fact that the writing style is very simplistic.I had to put it down when confronted with something along the lines of ' after fighting for survival virtually every moment since the disaster had begun a slice of good luck finally came the way of Emma  Michael and Carl' What's wrong with this you say? Well at this point in the story the only fight for survival these three charecters have faced is driving around in a van. Nothing at this point has threatened them heck they haven't even run out of gas. This is half-way through the book mind you.As a stand alone story if you have never read any zombie fiction ...it still kinda sucks. If you have read basically anything else say Brian Keene's 'The Rising' for example or Robert Kirkman's 'The Walking Dead' comics then I have a hard time thinking you will like this light weight attempt that reads like it was written by a freshman in high school (albeit a freshman that probably made a fair amount of coin off of the ignorant masses. Someone said this is being made into a movie? Man I'm in the wrong line of work!)One bit of respect for the author- this first book in the series is available as a PDF on his website so at least you don't have to pay for it. If you do like it then buy the rest of them because it is a pretty cool concept. ",1.0
" I was quite disappointed after reading Autumn. Maybe it was the large anticipation I had incorporated when purchasing the book thinking that post-apocalyptic scenarios were 'my kind of thing' (and they still are). However Moody's book was very poorly written. Not only did I encounter numerous grammatical mistakes but there was absolutely no connection with the characters. It was almost like 'here are the characters now you must try and relate to them and follow through with their overly obvious situations.' I felt no sympathy with Carl's death or any other middle school -written events that occurred. Overall this was a terrible book in the sense that there was no captivation whatsoever. Although the abysmal stance of Autumn Moody is an amateur and will hopefully progress in later writings. ",1.0
" I am mad at myself for wasting ten bucks on this book! The plot was slower than a turtle swimming in a pool full of yogurt. The characters were boring and I never felt any connection to any of them. The zombies were equally as boring. I grew weary of the snarky way the characters were in the beginning when they were all still in the one depressing building together. I expected things to pick up after Emma Mike and Carl struck out on their own but that didn't happen either.One of the best series I've read (zombie themed) was the 'As the World Dies' trilogy by RhiannonFrater. Those books were fast paced full of action and intrigue and the characters were interesting. Plus it also made you think about how mankind really WOULD react if some similar apocalypse occurred. I CARED about the characters in that story and immediately downloaded the second and third books in this series after reading the first. I WON'T be doing that with the 'Autumn' series. ",1.0
" I felt like I was reading the outline for the book and not the actual end result. Like if the author of the Dick and Jane series wrote a zombie story this is what it would be like. I kept on though despite the many many frustrating and confusing misprints typos and grammatical errors because I am in desperate need of zombie reading material. It was slow and annoying because the characters in the book seemed to all be like minded in the sense that there were always ONLY two options and never any more and the zombies don't cause any threat at all until like the last 3 chapters and even then the threat is minimal.Why read a zombie novel only to have the story based on the emotions of the characters and their incredibly uncreative brains and not the trails and thrills of survival in a dooms day like setting? I mean that's what draws me to zombie fiction in the first place... I assume I am not alone in this.All in all I was very disappointed with the story and hope for more books to come out like Justin Cronin's The Passage and the Max Brooks novel World War Z. Also if anyone happening to read this knows of more books similar to the ones I just put out there please do me a favor and comment on this review with the info as I am always interested in quality zombie reading material!",1.0

" I honestly fear for mankind after hearing this album. Even more so I worry about everyone who loves it so much. If you're finding absolutely anything about this album to be inspiring exceptional unique or even GOOD in the slightest (with one exception which I'll get to later) you obviously haven't heard nearly enough REAL music and obviously have been inducted into the Mindless Drones With Money to Burn Hall of Fame.Moby's formula is to take a sample loop it and add drums. He does this over and over again. There are no exceptions. For some reason people find this 'deep'.Some tracks are 'ambient'--otherwise known as 'narcoleptic'. When a song absolutely DOES NOT CHANGE for four minutes--and what's there to begin with is hardly exciting--it's left the realm of true ambient music and gone into sleep-inducing terrifyingly bad hype.As for the 'deeper meaning' behind this obvious attempt to [put] out yet another commercialized sellout record (not like he had any talent whatsoever to begin to sell out with) simply put--there is none! Where are people finding meaning and substance in 'why does my heart feel so bad' repeated over and over for 3 minutes? Where is the purpose and direction in 'gunnahunnagumbay'?The lone exception to this rule is the exceptional song 'everloving'--download that and enjoy because if you're looking for that kind of music you'll most likely hate the rest of the album.If you want to listen to real music that actually has substance unlike this amateur [stuff] listen to Delerium's album Karma... Enigma's Screen Behind the Mirror.... Amethystium's Aphelion.... Sorten Muld's III....There is so much good music out there--don't waste your time on this one. ",1.0

But the rest of the album isn't as skillfully made.Songs like 'Run On' 'Honey' 'Bodyrock' and 'Natural Blues' COULD have been great but are weighed down by excessive repetition. Eventually it gets to be too much and I don't even listen to those songs. Listen to the 30 second samples of those songs...and you have it all.And then to top it off there are those songs that are just completely horrible. I'm not sure if 'Down Slow' or 'Inside' can even be called songs. They don't really seem to have any sort of structure just a few minutes of drum machine beats and wavering background music. They are just no fun at all to listen to.Get 'South Side' off of iTunes and leave it at that. ",1.0

But does that make it a good album?To many people I'm sure it does but to me it doesn't. For in essence all Moby has done is taken samples of old blues tracks and placed a drumloop and some piano melodies underneath there's nothing good about that. In fact it's very very lazy.Now I do accept he has done it very well but that doesn't change my opinion. I'm not totally against sampling but he does it on nearly every track with no use of innovation then what's the point? At least DJ Shadow knows how to 'use' a sample.The way Moby has shamelessly sold the rights of every track on this album bar one to advertisers means also you have probably heard every track already therefore you may not need to purchase this 'recycled' album.Well of course it's upto you but I prefer the originals!

Okay great...but stick it in another category like blues or gospel. This album has no business being the number 1 dance/dj pick whatsoever. How this album has anything to do with techno is beyond my understanding which is probably attributed to the fact that this album is NOT techno. I wouldn't even call it electronica. It's more of a fusion between blues and synth sounds in an attempt to reflect how depressed this person feels. If you're looking for emotional music in the genre of electronica I suggest CAFE DEL MAR VOL. 5 or UNDERWORLD which fits more in the realm of techno than MOBY does.Don't misinterpret my words....

It has one redeeming quality...I think it would be a valuable resource for an avertising exec for commercial music. I recognized two tracks that are currently background music in TV commercials.

" If you're expecting a book that details the authors in-depth experiences with Benedictine spirituality or a how-to book on retreats. Then this is not the book for you. This book should have been called 'The Cloister-Lite Walk'. And as a Catholic I found this book to be very offensive.This book centers on the happenings of the author's daily life with a sprinkling of her 'not-so much about' experiences with Benedictine spirituality where all of the chapters are laid out according to the Liturgical year (Saints days / feasts days).For Catholic's looking for some insight on Benedictine spirituality and retreats...be forewarned. This book is written by an author who claims to have returned to her Protestant roots and wants to share how Benedictine spirituality has had an influence on her life.But if you scratch past the surface of this you will find that contained in the book are stories of Benedictine religious who are not in the least faithful to the teachings of the Catholic church.For example on page 12 she speaks of a monk named David....'he purchased an amulet of a whale's fluke... The woman who sold it to him said it had been blessed by a Methodist bishop but he could also take it to a priest of the old religion. 'I did' he said. 'It cost me a six-pack of beer and a carton of cigarettes'You will also find ALOT of ANTI-CATHOLIC BIAS in this book. The author states that the writings of Saint Jerome cause modern women to think that 'women must be either virgins or whores either blessed or cursed while men are simply sexual athletes slaves of lust'. (page 24)Assumes that in the hospital where she was born that the nuns being who they are 'one of them may have baptized me in secret' (page 88) That celibacy in the Catholic church should show us how 'we need only look at newspaper accounts of sex abuse by priests to see that celibacy isn't working' (page 116).The author shows her true ignorance as to the origins of the sex abuse scandal. I recommend that readers get ahold of the book 'Goodbye Good Men' by Michael S. Rose which shows that celibacy is far from being the reason why the horrors of the abuse of children by priests occurred.The author then takes a much-loved Catholic saint 'Maria Goretti' and reduces her to nothing more than a virgin-patsy used by the Catholic Church just like Marilyn Monroe was by those she knew in her life and states that Maria Goretti 'in a curious way she reminds me of Marilyn Monroe' (page 223). On top of this she agrees with what was said in article on Maria Goretti that states 'that a woman was better dead than raped'.... And by canonizing her the church has seemed to many to agree.' (page 224)The author appears to think that it would have been better if Maria Gorretti allowed herself to be raped and shouldn't have defended her virginity. This kind of liberalism trying to pass as a book showing her respect towards Benedictine spirituality whilst at the same time throwing out her little anti-Catholic jabs is reason enough for any devoted Catholic to pass on this book.A final example of her anti-Catholicism is the chapter entitled 'Women and the Habit",1.0

" If anyone is actually looking for a true tale of the plight of California Indians don't bother to look at Jackson's novel.It is inherently racist written by a woman who doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same likes as Upton Sinclair or Harriet Beecher Stowe.On one of her visits to California Jackson called the Native Americans she saw 'loathsome abject and hideous.' In her novel she doesn't stray far from this inherent indignation of another race. In fact she most likely had no idea she was being racist another reason entirely why this book should be burned. ALternately thorughout the book Jackson refers to the indians Ramona and ALlesandro encounter as 'patient creatures' (16) 'poor creatures' (20) 'wild creatures' (47) 'faithful creatures' (353) 'miserable creatures' (324) 'vagabond bands' (286) 'like beasts' without the Christianizing presence of the Missions (231). are they human? possibly. are they equal to the pastoral spanish who enslaved them that Jackson venerates so much? most definitely not.Secondly ALlesandro could be the most anglicized Indian ever. He is most assurredly an abberation physically looked like a mexican was the most devout catholic lives in a house that is like any mexican villa. INdeed Jackson remarks that 'There were not many such Indians as Allesandro and his Father. If there had been it would have been better for their people' (327) and that he 'almost makes one forget he is an Indian.' (101).also she refuses to create an interracial love story. the whole crappy book is predicated on the fact that Ramona is half indian. only when she is indian can she fulfill Jackson's debased notion of racial determinism.Besides the myriad moral reasons why this book is so terrible it could be the most groandiose verbose and pooorly written romance book EVER. the characters lack any moral ambiguity which would make for interesting characterization and are constantly marked by sweeping romantic gestures that could better be classified as trash fiction than a literary classic.You'd find more entertainment from reading the yellow pages than wasting your time.

" I have no idea why this film is practically out of print & why it's so expensive when it's so indescribably awful. I also have no idea why so many people love this film. I purchased a copy of it recently to see what the hype was all about (e.g. the rumor floating around that it had a lot of sex in it & my parents forbidding my older sisters to see it in the '80's. This was surprising since my parents were pretty lenient in letting us watch almost every movie we wanted to when my sisters & I were growing up). To my dismay the sex scenes really didn't show that much. The only decent things I can say is that the cinematography is good (e.g. the orange lighting in the scenes where Jade (Brooke Shields) & David (Martin Hewitt) are making love. Martin Hewitt is great eye-candy for the female viewers in this film.The film's not even so bad it's good. I did recently watch 'I Love the '80's Strikes Back 1981' on VH-1 & was amused by how awful the stars on the show said it was & the jokes they made about it. The acting is awful by everybody & no one is really likable in the film. Jade's parents are morons. The father tries to be cool & smoke grass & drink alcohol with the kids. He usually ends up making a fool out of himself dancing around idiotically. Basically he's only nice when he's under the influence. Jade's mom struggles to sputter out easy sentences & sayings souding like a child learning Hooked on Phonics & is so sex-starved that she tries to pull an a la Graduate & make it with David. Jade's older brother (James Spader) is not happy with David dating Jade even though he introduced the two!Brooke Shields disturbs me in this film. I always got the feeling that she was exploited in this film (as she was in many others when she was young e.g. Pretty Baby as a 12-year-old prostitute The Blue Lagoon in which she's way too young to be wearing barely nothing & having sex) as some unstable young nymphomaniac who acts much younger than 15. This is especially evident in the rape scene that was so nauseating I had to fast forward past it. It's long after David has intentionally set fire to Jade & her family's house & they meet up again a couple of years later & he rapes her making her demand over & over again to proclaim his love to her & she's crying. Afterwards she's still on his bed acting flirty & nonchalant as if nothing happened. What a f@#%*# up scene!After the scene I just mentioned I kept on fast forwarding through the film to stop the madness & because I really didn't care what would happen. I just wanted it to end. Does it have a point? Maybe it does - that arson will not win back the heart of the girl you love? Or maybe that obsessive love will most likely & almost always lead to tragic consequences? But who really cares any way? I suggest you save your money & rent better films about obsessive love like the uncensored version of 9 1/2 Weeks & the 1st version of Romeo & Juliet. ",1.0
" I enjoyed Brooke Shields in The Blue Lagoon so I ordered a VHS copy of Endless Love to see more of her. This movie has a low-budget quality to it including grainy picture with poor sound. Others have laid out the plot and I agree with those who pointed out the weaknesses which made it difficult for me to watch all the way through. Sex and love can get confusing because before long a pair-bonding type of addiction occurs.

" This film is inconsistent in many ways. Set up as a forbidden love story between two teen agers bitterly opposed by the father of the girl the film stops making sense that you realize that the girl's family is supposed to be a bunch of progressive ex-hippies who encourage their children to experiment and hold wildest parties on the block. Why hate the kid when he is trying so desperately to become part of the clan? The enemy number two is the girl's brother who happens to be this guy's best friend who introduced him to his sister in the first place!Beyond that the film starts falling apart. Father forbids them to see each other for a month because of the girl's failing grades and the kid goes bonkers and sets the house on fire. The obvious question is why aren't they talking in school and what sort of friendship is it that can't survive a thirty day separation? Unless the guy is obssessed with the girl and the girl is not interested.Whatever merits the original novel had got lost in this screen adaptation. No reason for the attraction is given nor does the film show any relationship between the two beyond sexual attraction. The girl's folks are not at all recognizable as former hippies but you can definitely see traces of old world aristocracy in them with the duck hunting and with pretensions to preppiness and upper classdom why then did they introduce the kid to the girl in the first place by a jealous brother no less???Finally the film disgisted me because the guy is clearly a stalker and the girl is objectified and the whole affair is shown as GREAT LOVE! On a couple of occasions the guy forces himself on the unwilling girl and they explode into passionate lovemaking. In the final analysis the message in the film validates every stalker in that the object of their obssession will yield to them in the end if only they get through to her against all odds and against all reason. Except in this story the stalker is the hero and a victim. ",1.0
" You have to be kidding! Maybe endless therapy is a more telling title!Though the book was an international bestseller the movie is only a shadow of what Scott Spencer wrote. Endless Love had the potential to be another Love Story but Franco Zeffirelli didn't pull it off. Perhaps the passage of time makes the film seem shallow and morbid in its sappiness but what comes out on the screen is two love-crazed teenagers driven to distraction. A 15-year-old girl is best off forging a solid core identity and not having emotional turbulence that young romantic love provokes. A 17-year-old boy about to graduate high school should be looking towards his future. The parents are as much to blame in the story line for their lack of guidance and misunderstanding about the overwhelming feelings teenage hormones have on adolescent minds.If you like sappy romance without the strength of acting dialogue and a decent story.... Endless Love is your tale. Otherwise ... just get over it. There are better told tales of the heart out there.Suggestions",1.0

It's interesting enough to make you wonder what exactly is going on but cheesey enough towards the end to make you understand exactly why it's played at 3 in the morning. George Newbern is the best feature of the movie fine acting and seems to be too good for the movie itself. Drew Barrymore(we all know how much she has improved since 'Doppelganger'and I personally think she is a great actress. That having been said-)leaves so very much to be desired. She has an awkward deliverence of her lines but most of the fault I suspect lies in the story itself. The movie appears to be getting good by the middle by falls short at the end.

" I must agree with Schroedinger that this is a poorly written book. It seems that novices who've only seen one or two quantum physics texts in their lives fall for the smooth talking style of Griffiths. Don't fall for it! For example the section on angular momentum and spin is one of the worst I've ever read. Griffiths gets the reader lost in a heap of math without taking the time to describe the picture behind it. (I'm not complaining about the level of math in the book but his failure in communicating the physical insight or feeling of quantum phenomena.)Even the small book by Paul Davies is better written and more insightful than Griffiths.My personal recommendations are the Feynman Lectures on Physics (volume III) and Introduction to the Quantum Theory by David Park (even Griffiths acknowledges in his own text that Park is an excellent book). After these two you may want to hit Shankar or Sakurai. (As I said above the book by Davies is pretty good too.) ",1.0

He introduces Schroedinger's Equation on the FIRST page without giving any of the traditional 'plausibility arguments'. He bypasses any discussion of the Old Quantum Theory (Bohr's Correspondence Principle and the Bohr-Summerfeld quantization conditions). He gives a watered down introduction to the Dirac formalism which fails to adequately explain Dirac's measurement theory and such important concepts as simultaneous eigenkets and non-commuting observables.There are innumerable superior QM books at the undergraduate level.

" While Golding is correct in that there is a dark side to human nature he is a fool for having created such an implausible plot.Boys of that age rarely attack people under any circumstances.Instaed they use more subtle forms of psychological warfare.They could only have acted like that if they had had to eat each other to survive.

" Golding's idea was brilliant. He delved into the true hidden nature of humans; our origin as an animal. In his book a group of young boys are stranded on an island without any adults. They set up a society with rules goals and a leader. Of course this society fails miserably. Rules are disregared goals are forgotten and the leader is overthrown. Their miniature civilization degrades into chaos. The implication is that civilization as a whole is just a thin mask that covers our more primal nature.The idea is well thought out and interesting. However Golding focuses on the details of the boys' existance and the symbolism of the story to the point that the story itself is lost. The only remotely interesting part is the end when he stops focusing on the symbolism as much and lets the story drive home the points that he tries to make throughout the book.If you want an examination of human nature then read this book.If you want an adventure story look elsewhere. ",1.0
" This book doesn't deserve a review. With all due respect Golding couldn't write a good book to save his life. His writing is reminiscent of Tolkien's; he comes up with a great story and then ruins it with horrible writing. But I suppose I should stop ranting about the book and get on to a summary.A relatively large group of young boys are marooned on an island. One young boy Ralph decides he's the leader because has in his possession a conch shell which most SpongeBob fans will recognize from one of the episodes. In his 'Inner Circle' there are some other boys",1.0
" I might just be a teen in high school but I know what I like and this book was not one in my interest. Although William Gerald Golding wrote this worthwhile astonishing book it made no imapct to my opinion. The book was very well presented and had touching moments but lacked the realism that books have to maintain. Its moments of exitement were short lived and really weren't that exciting to begin with. All in all it was a hell of a book to those who actually like reading books. To tell the truth I hardly remember what the book was about. ",1.0

But I however did not like the book for the sole reason of the killings and how the boys felt no remorse at all except for Ralph.

" This book is probably one of the most boring books I have EVER read! The book is about a group of boys stranded on an island. The author tries to show how society works and what would happen if a group of young boys were stranded on an island but fails miserably. His opinion of what would happen is just wrong. And even if you do agree (once you've read the book) the writing still destroys the book. It is such a slow book! Way too much unnecassary details! When it comes to an actual important part of the book there is barely any time spent on it. I would not recommend this book to anyone!! (unless you want to see for yourself how bad it is!) ",1.0
" It's interesting to see how cynical a successfull author can be and how popular such cynicism can be. Lord of the Flies might be a suspenseful and thought-provoking book but it's main thesis --children turning into beasts as soon as the burden of civilization is taken off them-- is utterly silly. It makes me wonder how many children Mr. William Golding really knew or talked to before writing this book. Children are always capable (many times much more than grownups) to act with common-sense and responsibility. I think Mr. Golding knew this (he can't be that narrow-minded) but simply choose to forget it since it would destroy his thesis and he wouldn't be able to write this novel. It's also fun to see how easily some authors can ignore or blur the most simple realities. I don't recommend this book to anyone who loves children and childhood which is a period of exploration and friendships. ",1.0

" 'The lord of the flies' By william Golding is in my opinion one of the most boring book i have ever read in my whole life. but on the other hand it did have alot to say about our 'humanly nature' most of it was true.This book was like a little summary of our violent nature throughout history.

" In all honesty 'Lord of the Flies' is probably the most painfully boring story (and I use that word loosely) that I have ever had the misfortune of reading. The plot is simple and the characters are presented in a way that makes them difficult to enjoy reading about. The book is around 150 pages which is strange seeing that it took me about three weeks to finish because I had to will my eyes to lurch over every page. Other than it being the most uninteresting book one can find the characters make me equally angry. I realize just as well as the next person that they're stuck on an island and that they're all younger than me but these children are just unimaginably dense throughout the story. They become so out of touch with reality that they even take to hunting down their leader. What am I supposed to find symbolic and interesting about that? People keep going on about how this book is teaming with symbolism but I'm just not seeing it just because you have a bunch of kids stranded on an island doesn't mean that that relates to religion society etc. Aside from the characters annoying me at a personal level the way the author portrays them is even more ridiculous. If William Golding spent half as much time on the plot and not describing the children and scenery he may have had a half-decent story on his hands. If someone is looking for a decent book about survival try 'The Stand' by Stephen King at least he made it interesting to read. ",1.0
" I was disgusted by the grotesque display of savagery in this novel. I found it lacking purpose and realism. All I found in this novel is one man's sick views of humanity. I do not reccomend this novel to anyone especially children. ",1.0
" Oh. My. God. Can we say ATROCIOUS?! One star is too much for this piece of dung. Symbolism is nice and quite beautiful in some places and for certain writers but this book had WAY too much of it. Golding's novel is very horrendous in the fact his absolutely mind-numbing style immediately drove me away in his tedious and unnecessary description that wasn't even striking in any way. I'll give it a bit for having good description in a few places but only a miniscule few.But that isn't even the reason for this rating. What I found most unpleasantly apalling was the content of this so-called classic. It completely and utterly disappointed me in its horrific plot that I wouldn't even care to mention. Am I a happy-go-lucky reader? No; In fact I quite often enjoy the sad and angry scenes in many novels but an element of this one that I still can't quite name and don't care to that made those scenes so obtuse. This book should be completely wiped off and eradicated from the lists of classics to read and analyze in schools. ",1.0

" Lord of the Flies is alright I guess. I mean I know it's a classic but the plot is distinctly lacking in so many ways you feel like it should be updated for today's readers. For instance there are no touchscreen interfaces OF ANY KIND in this book. Nobody has a camelback or even an earth-friendly stainless steel water bottle. And unless I'm forgetting something there's no suggestion whatsoever that aliens or supernatural intruders are secretly present on the island. I don't know I guess there's just a lot of missed opportunity in this book. Maybe whoever wrote it should think about some revisions? Because as it is there's really not much to it except a searing journey into mostly unanswerable questions about what it is to be human. ",1.0
" I have seen several reviews in here that say this book was boring; It wasn't boring it was nasty! Several people also said it wasn't for people under thirteen. Well I'm twelve and I read mostly adult books so it's not like I didn't understand it. It's just that I hated it! Yes I admit there is evil lurking inside everyone I know. But I find it hard to admit that it could be quiet as much as Mister Golding portrays. There are also some nice little descriptions about a bunch of savage boys dying very painful deaths and I wonder why anyone would title their book after a pig's head speared on a stick. ??????? In my opinion if you haven't read this book dont' touch it unless you want to have your fingers tainted forever. ",1.0
" The book starts out pretty quickly and anyone reading it could probably catch on pretty quickly. There has been a plane crash and the only survivors are a number of British boys ages 4 to about 14. Soon after they realize that they are on an uninhabited island and that they must rely on themselves to survive and to get rescued. Upon arriving at the island they have a group meeting and when Ralph is voted chief of the island Jack is left as an also-ran. That's something what I liked about this novel the whole idea of children being captive on an island living of pigs and fruit and trying to maintain a civilization with order and authority all by themselves.However I am surprised that I actually finished this book. This book is beyond the most boring and dull book in the world. It seems as if William Golding spend weeks on each paragraph and dialogue just to sound so 'absolutely intellectual to the highest extent'. From the looks of it I'd say that he tried way too hard to impress his Oxford college friends. Unless if you are really into the symbolism or if you have a master's degree with an English major then you would have been able to understand everything in this book. From every significant event to every detail expressed about the children's actions or their surroundings it is better to have Cliff Notes by your side if you wanted to catch every little segment of symbolism and importance. ",1.0
" I hated this book! It was full of blunt unequivocal sybolism. I think that is one of the major problems; every few sentences you discover a new oddity that is supposed to directly link itself to the majority of underlying human disposition. However I found that most of these allegories just didn't quite manifest as true on the whole. Golding has taken simple facts and drastically over-exaggerated them. My second point is that the characters seem underdeveloped and because of this I found myself wishing they would all die off and then just maybe a more interesting story could arise. Perhaps I had more trouble relating than others might because of the fact that i am not living in the time period of the book and that all of the characters were boys younger than myself. You see I am in 10th grade and had to read this book last year for my english class (and by the way I read many many books in my spare time). I found all of the main personae in this book caustically unlikable (as I said before I found myself wishing they were all dead). I also think it is sad that this book is so repetitive through the whole book the troupe was splitting... then there was one well the rest couldn't have that so they try to kill him and aside from actually saying who went with which group and when and why the boys' monologue seemed to be 'what is the other tribe doing?' 'what will we eat tonight?' 'when and how can we be rescued?' etcetera. This did not fit well with the consistent symbolism and was not very well integrated into the story. Ok well all grumbling aside the last two chapters were at very least full of action but of course i was dissapointed that they didn't all perish in the end of the book. I suppose though to each thier own because this is definitely a love it/ hate it type of book. I do not recommend this to anyone who likes to relate to books in any way but if you must read it at least it is fairly short... ",1.0
" In my opinion this is one of the most boring books ever written. Sure Golding is trying to make a point about power's effect on social stability and structure but it is lost in the mumbo jumbo style that he writes with. (The movie is also a pathetic depiction of this cliche-ish message.) There are so many books out there that deal with this same topic and because of this common subject matter a novelist needs to be truly inventive to create a real masterpiece. This book should not be ranked anywhere near the top 100 novels on the Modern Library Association's list of the best novels of the 20th century. ",1.0
" Perhaps it is because of my age I'm nearing 23 that I find this work so to quote someone from the board atrocious.This book is absolutely boring and hadn't it been for my friend's reference I would not have bought iT!!!

The major characters are Jack Merridew (the bully) Piggy (the dweeb) and Ralph (The chief and someone in between).Lord of the Flies is a journey of civilised minds turning savage. Everything starts off hunky dory as the children realise they have the whole island to themselves and that no adult is there to govern their behaviour. Everything begins in a civil manner",1.0

" Lord of the Flies showcases the idea that we are empty canasters being filled by environments and echoes the haunting statement that children are capable of immoral acts. Perhaps it uses the Robinson Crusoe idea of isolation.I do think as inspirational as Lord of the Flies has been that it's an overblown overrated affair and that Golding wrote other more powerful works such as Darkness Visible. The problem for me lies in the difficulties of using children as main characters while writing from an adult point of view. Difficult to relate to harder to realistically decribe a child's feelings and emotions because psychologically the author is on another level (even though the novel's fiction). On the other hand Golding's style is attractively fluent in that you want to find out what happens next and that's always a good sign for a classic read. ",1.0
" I have recently went through the extremely torturous chore of reading this novel in my eleventh grade English class. I hated this book so much that I went up to my teacher and told her exactly what I thought of this abysmal piece of work. Guess who wasn't too happy. I've heard so many great things about this book so I just couldn't wait to start it. 'Yeah Lord of the Flies great!' From the first page I hated it. This book is so hard to follow. I read a page. Then I think to myself 'What the heck was that?' I read the page again and only got a vague impression of what was going on and struggling to figure out what William Golding was trying to get across to the reader. Sure its possible to figure it out but how can you really enjoy a novel if you have to strain your brain to be able to get the badly told story into your mind and keep it there. I disliked this book so much that I removed the cover and glued it on upside down before I gave it back to my teacher. ",1.0

" My favorite chapter in this book would definitely be the first chapter when the kids are introduced on the island. There was this one kid that everyone had called piggy. To me that is the funniest thing in the world. I don't know why but the humiliation of another kid is extremely hilarious. It may seem cruel but to me it's funny. I would have to say that this book was definitely for the older more mature kids like high school kids. All in all I would have to say that even with the kid getting humiliated I dislike this book with a passion it is way to boring and just when you think it's going to get good the book disappoints you and I don't think that is a very good book for the serious reader ",1.0
" When I first picked up this book I was expecting a masterpiece-a work of outstanding literature. After all I had only heard great things about it. However I was extremely disappointed once I ventured on to read past the first chapter. Slowly I progressed onward making my way through endless descriptions multiple plots and enough symbolism to make my head ache. I think Mr.Golding should have remembered that not ONLY are themes important to keep the reader's interest but PLOT is too. This book is an excellent example of how someone can get so lost in the hidden meaning of their words they forget what they're trying to SAY in the first place. Not only are their problems with the actual structure of the book but also in the language used. There is a wide variety of slang used which is for the most part chiefly British! I found myself rereading sentences more than two times just to understand what was being said. By half-way through the book I actually wanted to stop and start reading something else. Also throughout the book Mr.Golding leaves off on one note and starts a completely different series of events. By the end of the book there are so many plots going on it gets old trying to follow which one is going on at the moment. So in summary if you want to read a book which has multiple plots too much symbolism and descriptions to put you to sleep then Lord of the Flies is for you. ",1.0

Golding in a vain effort to make people understand his sideways point of view wrote a parody of 1940's British society. Who really gives a crud? I don't.

" My opinion of this book is that this book was horrible. The only time that it caught my eye was when they first got stuck on the island and when they got off. So basicallyin the middle of this book i wasn't listening. This book had alot of realism and creativity that was probably the highest point of this book. If I would have to pick a leader for them i wouldn't have picked any of them because they all act like animals. And the events that took place like for one when they thought that Simon was the beast that was just dumb to me. I also gave it one star because it didn't deserve anyting better than that.The friendship between Ralph and Piggy was odd. Another thing that was odd was these kids had the urge to kill one another. At the beginning of this book I asked myself'How did all these kids survive but not one adult did?' I think the book would have been a whole lot better if they had about 2 or 3 adults to keep the kids from talking about that ridiculous beast. The Lord Of The Flies I read for an sophmore english class.

" For english class we had to read Lord of the Flies by Golding.. It was an ok book... if you like adventure stories... personally i dont. however Goldings use of symbolizm is great. The book sickened me at certain parts. The descriptions were great but after reading an entire chapter and then some more descriptions it gets sort of boring. However i did like how Jack and Ralph TRIED to get along in the beggining you know BEFORE Jack went crazy. I also liked Goldings purpose of this book... how deep down we are savages. And he was right. ",1.0
" I really hated this book. I only read it because I was forced to read it in school. I think that the author is trying too hard to write a good book. There must have been a reason why this was out on the market for 5 years before anyone picked it up. The author tells you too much information in a short amount of time. He starts to talk about something and then just moves on to something else. He also leaves you hanging. He also uses way too many uncompleted sentences! Reading this book was a complete and total waste of my time!!!!!! ",1.0
" William Golding does not leave readers with any thinking space to ponder of the values he brought up in the book. Unlike Harper Lee whose novel requires a certain level of intelligence to interpret and understand this novel spits out the themes directly leaving no space for imagination. Even the symbols are so simple and uninteresting.This book has such a cynical and pessimistic view of the world that i totally disagree with. I believe that no child would cause such destruction as this and no child would be like he described a incarnate of Satan.It is a book with his own thinking. It may be good if one understands and agrees with his way of thinking.I don't. ",1.0

" I was assigned to read this book for World History. My teacher said that it related to man's inner self and she led discussions how Golding is trying to portray that man is inherently evil and killing is man's natural instinct.

" As a response to one of the reviews that speaks quite highly of this novel I would like to say that despite my understanding and comprehension of the book I still found it entirely dull boring and a waste of my time. Since it was required of me to read this book in school I was forced to make my way through each dragging chapter but I would have never on my own time and it's not because I didn't understand the book that I feel this way about it. My class discussed quite thouroughly about the book's symbolism which was Golding's intention to start out with. Despite its hidden meanings the novel still remains absolutely ridiculous in the sense that these young British boys turn completely salvage and kill their fellow islanders. If the book was looked at through a totally symbolic perspective it would make more sense but in order to understand its symbolism one still has to read it and it is really not worth it. ",1.0
" While I was reading this incredibly violent novel I could hardly bear to go on. I couldn't wait to finish it. Not because of the fabulousness of the book but because I couldn't wait to put the book down; it was so dumb. Unfortunately I was forced to finish the whole thing for English class. I'm glad the whole 'Lord of the Flies' topic is over. I've given several reviews on this book but since none of them came out I'm making one again---so I can tell everyone to be cautious and not to buy this book. No---that may be a little too harsh. I think this book is very uninteresting for most teens so I don't reccomend this book to be read by kids in the 16 and below age range. I suppose it's bearable---for someone who actually enjoys reading books like myself. But this would be utter hell for those who despise reading. The whole thing is just so wrong. Too many descriptions extremely wrong moral/point or whatever way too violent and I agree that W. Golding also failed to mention who was saying what sometimes as the reader from Houston said. I don't agree though that the ending was good. It's like there's this bunch of British boys stranded on a little island. Then they start getting all violent and drifting farther and farther away from their normal civilized selves. They form into two groups---the good group with Ralph and the bad group (also known as the tribe) with Jack---and fight over the silliest things. In the end two characters no longer exist---they've been killed by some of the boys. After all that senseless stuff all that happens is that a cruiser comes and rescues them and the whole nightmare is over. I mean stupid or what? ",1.0
" Until Lord of the Flies I had NEVER left a book unfinished. Flies was excruciatingly dull and uses way too much advanced vocabulary making it impossible to understand. The plot was horrible and the characters under developed. I had trouble keeping the characters straight. They just seemed to blend together and had no distinct personality. I pity anyone sucked into reading this. It was one of the worth things I have ever read and I absolutely despise it. I would just like to know what the heck Golding was thinking when he wrote this! If it was possible I would have given this book a negative ten. A one is much too high for such a poor excuse for literature. ",1.0

" I seldomly read a book that makes me want to drink my own urine. This book seems to capture every element that I hate.For starters the book drops you onto this island.

Now if I was 10 or 13 and such... I would not resort to killing people after like the second week. Then there is the fact of Ralph. Ralph is really arrogant of Piggy's feelings and eventually starts becoming annoying. Piggy is the only real character I liked next to Simon. Jack is really arrogant also. He is so immature that it is almost laughable. Didn't these kids come from a private school? My gosh to think that one week on an island could make some of the worst sins be committed by 10 year old boys....The whole detail of the story becomes a little to fine for its own good. The pictures the author describe have no meaning to me. Apparently there is a square pink piece of land jutting out of the beach. What? The whole end of chapter 3 was the worst when Simon walks through the forest. I just stopped caring about how that blade of grass was bent at a 76 degree angle.For those who want a great book try Tolkien or R.A. Salvatore.

" I recently saw this movie at a friend's house and it was quite good... for a great many laughs. I usually love post-Apocalyptic movies like the Mad Max series. The difference is that the Mad Max trilogy does a much better job of mixing modern and ancient and futuristic set pieces scenery and props. Beowulf just screwed it all up on so many levels. The outpost has a PA system and zippered-plastic body bags but no electricity. Some of the people are dressed in armour then you have the girl running around in Doc Martens and torn red thigh highs. My favourite was the porn-queen crimped hair succubus with way too much blue eyeshadow. She belonged in a Motley Crue video. Grendel was the least scary thing in the whole movie.I really loved the oversized Barber's razour 'chopper' thing at the beginning. At least the person being executed gets a last laugh when they see that ridiculous thing.Now for me to vent about how thoroughly they screwed up the storyline. Hrothgar was not (NOT!!) Grendel's father. Beowulf was not born 'half of Heaven and half of Hell' whatever that sounds so stupid. He was a Danish king no more no less. Lastly he killed Grendel's mother in a lake and did not run off with Hrothgar's daughter.I did have lots of fun ripping this movie apart while watching it so it does have it's good points. ",1.0

It's got nothing in common with a good movie. It's a travesty!The acting even with a so-called 'top talent' like Christopher Lambert is awful. The setting is almost non-existant and the plot ah yes the plot ....I knew this movie would reek within the first 10 minutes.

There isn't much plot except near the end. You spend the whole movie wondering when the actual story will begin. It canabalizes the Beowulf legend to the point where the only thing in common is some monster killing everyone.

" This is worse than a B movie. When my fiancee and I rented it we weren't sure what to expect but we figured since it has Christopher Lambert it couldn't be all that bad. We were wrong.There isn't much to this movie other than bad techno music a porn star and a bunch of technology that didn't fit anywhere in history except the late 19th century. The only thing the movie appears to share with the epic Beowulf is the name and a faint storyline of a half mortal half god being coming to destroy a creature that's wrecking havoc on a castle.I love Christopher Lambert but this movie did not do justice to his acting skills. He doesn't have any lines that are worth remembering the movie doesn't do much to develop his character and for being half human half god he's surprisingly vulnerable. There's a short (five minutes or less) amount of time given to why he's half human half god and why he's there to defeat the Grendal.The rest of the characters are pretty flat even Kyra (Rhona Mitra) and Grendal's Mother (Layla Roberts). There isn't anything special about either of the them and the only thing Layla Roberts brings to the film are a few dream sequences where she gets to act sexy and porn star like and Rhona Mitra really doesn't add anything.Beowulf really turned out to be a pretty one-dimensional movie with a lot of bad techno that really didn't fit. Add in one porn star some technology that's centuries before it's time lots of people who haven't been in a lot of well known movies and some sword fighting and you have a step below B grade movie.

WHOOSH! WHOOSH! then this film is for you. And the fact that this film is based on what is considered the first English language literary classic is sacrilegious. Everyone associated with this film should be subjected to that huge single-edged razor blade used to separate people shown in the beginning of the film.

There's one passable action scene in the first few minutes and Rhona Mitra is appealing in her low-cut leather bodice but she doesn't really do anything in the movie and frankly neither does anyone else. This movie is ten minutes of excitement jam-packed into two hours. It's not really 'funny bad' in a B-movie way and it's not really interesting on any other level.

Lambert's flat unemotional performance leaves even the best of fans (I loved the Highlander) cold. The highlight of the film has is the fight exchanges and even then the feats fall flat.

" This movie was in short terrible. The storyline was filled with holes and didn't even come close to following the original epic written so long ago.The actors almost seemed to be ashamed of themselves for taking part in this F-movie production. Simply because Christopher Lambert can wield a sword doesn't make him right for the part of a warrior as great as Beowulf was meant to be. Rhona Mitra was a waste of a character. As was Gotz Otto. Out of all the characters that were written in the epic poem only two of the original names were used. The rest were changed or omited unnecessarily.The creature they came up with for Grendel was cheap and even silly to say the least. The rest of the special effects were second rate as were the actors.The end scene with Grendel's mother was drawn out and sad.If you want to see a movie that has absolutely nothing to do with the great epic of Beowulf then buy otherwise save your money for something better. ",1.0
" After reading Beowulf I was curious how this great epic could be translated into other genres. Part of what makes the poem great is its language. It's chant-like use of alliteration caesura and compound wording makes it beautifully nuanced reading. Moreover the story itself has all the essential parts and themes to keep the reader intrigued. The film adaptation however had none of this.I was very disappointed to find that besides ignoring all of the above the movie created such ludicrous plot twists as a weakly contrived love interest and far fetched psychological melodrama. To treat this fundamentally christian-pagan poem this way is near sacrilige. ",1.0

" Cibo Matto are one of the many bands trying to be too many things at once while winking to their friends in the audience. Stereotype A is an appropriation of many disparate styles and it never comes together. The one lead singer in the band is very attractive which makes their shows a must. Nothing on Stereotype A suggests that Cibo Matto will ever be able to incorporate many styles into one seamless blend like a music maestro such as Rod Stewart whose many great albums are on sale right here at amazon the country's most reliable source for music and book purchases.

" What a disappointing overproduced overhyped mess. Yes the ladies have abandoned their former trip-pop sampled quirky kookiness for radio friendly very mainstream r&b blandness replete with empty romanticized lyrics (I really miss the food references) and annoying (Shades of a Carpenters revival) backing vocals. There are only two vaguely salvagable tracks here 'Sci-Fi Wasabi' (Derailed for me by an uncool Star Wars reference) and 'Blue Train' (Sounds like a bad Buffalo Daughter outtake). The rest is an indistinguishable blip on the Top 50 charts. And why did they tamper with 'Spoon' which was perfectly fine in its former incarnation (Perhaps to show off their improved diction)????

Anyone with an elementary knowledge of nature knows that any chemicals and pesticides used in the garden kill bees (an extremely vital link in our ecological chain) not to mention other beneficial insects. After one season of being plagued with squash beetles she gave up and used chemicals!?!? What does that teach anyone? If you truly want to be in balance with nature you must be a purist or at the very least practicing organic methods (beware some organic products harm bees too).

" Have you ever read a book on a subject with which you have some expertise and wonder if the writer is just making things up as he goes along? This was nearly the experience in reading this book by Duncan Lindsey a UCLA professor.The first problem is that Lindsey takes the shotgun approach to arguing his points against the existing child protective services system. Instead of centering his arguments on a few specific issues and developing his thesis he tries to address every conceivable aspect of the child welfare system and liberally scatters his thoughts and comments without a strong basis of analysis. The result is a loose confederation of ideas none of which with a firm foundation for acceptance.The second problem is that Lindsey attempts to address issues for which he does not seem to have actual knowledge. His attack on the legal basis of the child protective system for being a civil model rather than a criminal model is amateurish (at best). His understanding of the social workers management of the case lacks first hand understanding of the field. I wanted to give some examples to explain my points but it would result in a much longer review than what I prefer. It must suffice to say that I believe the professor's expertise is apparently more academic and esoteric than real life.A third problem is Lindsey's contradicting himself in various parts of his book. For example he spends time discussing how children's deaths is increasing but in another chapter argues that death is but a small area of concern for protecting children. He titles this later chapter as 'Child abuse the red herring of child welfare.' Therefore he argues that the current system is not doing enough to protect children from destructive parents but argues that too much of the same system focuses on a problem that is a small issue in child welfare. So which is it?It is unfortunate that the author did not sacrifice a couple of hundred pages and written a monograph on one of his points. Then he could have provided a document worth quoting and considering. Instead we have a lengthy diatribe absent developed charges worth remembering. ",1.0
" I have been interested in the ethical issues surrounding animals in society for some time but have only recently taken the step of becoming actively involved in the welfare of animals. I thought this book would provide a comprehensive introduction to activism. I found much of it to be highly abstract to the point of being incomprehensible. The 'ideal' that seems to be sought is certainly well-detailed but to me it seemed to be so far away from what is 'practical' that I finally gave up. I guess I'm more interested in getting my hands dirty and really doing something to lessen the suffering of animals than just thinking about doing so and constructing convoluted philosophies that will never be implemented.

" I paid good money for this CD online. The front cover of the CD says that it's a Parental Advisory CD  but it's not. The title track 'Daddy's Little Girl' is edited all over the place. This song is the reason why I purchased it & spent almost 11 bucks plus shipping & handling costs for it. I am greatly disappointed that Def Jam or Nikki D thinks that this album should be deserving of a Parental Advisory sticker if they're not going to stay true to the music & live up to it's Parental Advisory sticker warning label as intended. I'm not saying I enjoy listening to cuss words in music  but cuss words really are better than listening to the annoying beeping sounds & rewind sounds that this album contains. Again  beeping sounds are worse on the ears than cuss words. They are equally if not more annoying than the bad words. I believe in my 1st Amendment Rights & we as America are losing this right slowly  but surely if the government has it's way with us one of these days. We will soon have no right to Freedom Of Speech even through the means of adult content oriented Parental Advisory CD's that I am well aware of & am prepared for any & all curse words contained in an album I specifically buy & listen to. When there is a Parental Advisory sticker on an album & it's as extremely edited as tis one is  it makes me hesitate about buying any & all future albums that promise one thing but sell the opposite. If you don't mind edited music when the album says Parental Advisory on the front  then buy this album. But  if you want what you pay for  then you shouldn't. The producers & creators & musicians of this album lied when they stated it's a Parental Advisory album. It is not. It's an edited one. I would have been more happier if the Parental Advisory sticker was never introduced to this album & I would have had myself to blame when coming across all the edited music that was contained in it if I ever had false thoughts & reservations that this album contained explicit lyrics. I got jipped buying this album. I did not get the Parental Advisory version of this album that I as an adult listener am entitled to listen to as my own personal private to listen to this album with obviously no children around or in the room or within earshot of the music. What a waste of time in waiting for this item to come into the mail & a waste of money being lied to by the recording industry who were so brave to tag this album as a Parental Advisory CD  but was not even close to living up to that name.

" Along with Duiker Marr is one ingorrant of history in Vietnam in its people. Ho Chi Minh was a thief murderer and cruel dictator as the world has seen in Hitler Lenin Stalin Pol Pot and many others of the 20th century.Ho Chi Minh was never a nationalist he worried about his own persona and legacy to Vietnam as much as the dictators of the world worried about their image. He was a communist because no regular government would have listened to his crazy mind using it as a mean to his end. Just like Hitler he was nothing until some desperates listened to his so called charisma. When he lead the Communists in Vietnam he was a much as fault for the 3 millions killed during the war. He himself ordered executions of countless civilians as they refused to follow him. He forced thousands of Vietnamese to labor and camps in the North. From the North through the South of Vietnam people were scared of the Communists that's why the exodus of millions to the South in 1954 when the country was divided. And again in 1975 millions more left the country because the communists took over the rest of the country.Do you really think the Vietnamese wanted Ho to lead the country? Would they submit themselves to tyranny and death camps so they can enjoy the lives of a communist? No! They fled everywhere Communists appear. Because in the Communists' eyes anyone who is educated was a traitor anyone who had different ideas than theirs anyone who had religion land some kind of assets some kind of beliefs who hold traditional values was a traitor to their cause and therefore they must be dealt with with torture and death to the whole family as an example for others. Please refer to the movie 'Killing Fields' as an illustration of what was going on with Cambodie and Vietnam. It was never on the media because journalists were never allowed on the other side of the fence weren't they? The only thing you could see is just what Americans and the South Vietnamese were oppressing to the poor farmers. And how Jane Fonda made herslef useful to the NVA.So please explain to me where Ho was a nationalist and a liberator?Thirty years after the fall of Saigon Vietnam still struggles with poverty corruption and Communism where the rest of the world around Vietnam has taken off. Thanks to Ho and his communists all the intellectuals of the country are either in jail or fled out of the country and 95% out of the 80M Vietnamese is in poverty and earn less than $500 per year. And you can vote and have some kind of freedon only if you were to join the Communist Party. The rest of the people won't be allowed to voice their fears and frustations.What kind of freedom and democracy is that? ",1.0

" The plot is original and refreshing but the story is written in a bland Disney way. The author tries to put in twists and turns in the plot but it was all very predictable. She tried to define the character's personlities but waht should be done in a subtle quiet way had to basicaly be written down in bold faced ink. The plot centers too much around Firepaw and I found it annoying that he was glorified above all the other apprentices. He also seemed to be the only one able to see certain betrayels and he was always the glorious leader disobeying rules and being portrayed as a hero much like Harry Potter.I was hoping that the underdogs (Graypaw Whitestorm BLuestar Ravenpaw Yellowfang etc.) would get some of the spotlight and credit in this book but as I said the story is very Disney-like. The hero is a handsome thinker and rule-bender who wins the heart of a pretty female blah blah blah. The book shows a black and white portrayel of good and evil and we all know it is not like that at all. Books that show the good guys' and bad guys' motives allowing you a deeper understanding of the book and the world is what I wanted and I was grossly disapointed.

I don't think that young children should be hearing about the pleasure that cats (or any animals) get from a fresh kill. Those just aren't the types of things I want to introduce to him at his age. This book should really be targetted for older children (teenagers) not young readers.

" With the Warriors fanbase growing larger and larger I figured I'd give the first book a try. I wanted to like it but something about it just didn't hit the mark for me.First of all the characters blatantly annoyed me. The main character Firepaw was particuarly grating. I'm not sure if you're familiar with the title 'Gary-Stu' but it means a character who is beyond flaw who is handsome quick-witted and rarely gets in trouble for breaking the rules. These are a few qualities I noticed in Firepaw that made him truly unlikeable for me. The scene where he bravely attacks the cat taunting him for his 'kittypet' background and rips off his collar was enough to make me actually giggle.Another complaint I have about the characters is that they seemed like cardboard cut outs with the same stilted way of talking ('Look young apprentice. A sprout. Newleaf will be here in but a moon and then freshkill will be running well again.' not a direct quote but you get the idea) and not much personality except for the idea that they have a name and some color of 'pelt'.The plot left much to be desired too. The author was killing off characters faster than she could introduce them! Shortly after Firepaw is accepted into Thunderclan we learn that Greypaw's mentor Redtail has been killed in a battle. Overload of information? We barely know who Grewpaw is let alone his mentor. We can't really be expected to mourn over his death can we after just learning his name. I found that for most of the book knowledge was being shoved down my throat quicker than I could digest it. Thank goodness for the handy character key in the beginning of the book or I might not be able to keep those swarms of characters straight in my head! (I hope you note the sarcasm.)

" It was hard to believe I was reading Hemingway - but then again not really. His style of rambling sentences and thoughts was there. But he jumped around a lot. And the subject matter (an insider view of bullfighting) was despicable. Most of the book was spent trying to demonstrate that one was close-minded if one did not appreciate the art of the bullfight instead of getting hung up on the petty issue of the goring of the horses and the killing of the bulls. It was the first book in as long as I can remember that I did not finish. I kept saying it had to get better since this was Hemingway. Instead it kept getting worse. ",1.0
" I read this book for the literary circle at my high school and we unanimously declared it the worst thing we had ever read. It had no structure so it appeared to be a mixed-up jumble of thoughts. Since there was no structure the author strays off the 'topic' (supposedly bullfights) quite frequently into little discussions about 'venereal diseases' which he claims are relevant as they are a cause of death to many bullfighters.Perhaps if you have a Spanish background or love bullfighting or possibly Ernest Hemmingway it is possible you could relate to this book and enjoy it.Please note that our lit. circle read other books by Ernest Hemmingway. Those books including 'A Farewell to Arms' 'The Old Man and the Sea' and 'The Sun Also Rises' are definitely worth the read. Just because you liked other books by the same author please do not assume you will like this one. I LOVED 'The Old Man and the Sea' and 'The Sun Also Rises' but I couldn't stand this book. ",1.0
" Hemmingway may be a classic - but that doesn't mean this book has any place in literary history.How can an intelligent person defend a blood sport between man and animal that is unfair from the get-go? In bullfighting the bull whether he wins the fight or not will always be sent to a gruesome death. It is a hideous cruel sport that every Spaniard and supporter should be ashamed of. Why it has not been outlawed is a disgrace.Burn this book! ",1.0
" These strips did not work at all for us. We followed the instructions included by cleaning the tub with alcohol and then drying completely before applying the strips. Strips were applied and then the tub was not used for about 15 hours. Two days later two strips were 3/4 of the way detached from the tub which actually created more of a slipping hazard as the whole strip slid with your foot. Four days later 4 strips floated to the top of the bath water while my toddlers took their bath. 1 week later 3 strips ARE still attached. I have contacted 3M and they are having me send the strips back to them (and refunding my money) so they can test them for quality control. These strips are considered for 'light duty' but they did say that my tub which is used for 2 showers a day and one bath every other day does fall into the 'light duty' category. We are hoping to find another solutions which will work for us. I'm looking for more of a heavy duty or commercial grade strips since these did not work for me. ",1.0

" Like the reviewer socrates 17 I am waiting for ABC/Stephen King to credit Lars von Trier as the source of this new mini-series. Unfortunately judging from the promotions for the series (which include this book published by an arm of ABC network) it doesn't seem that they will. Instead they seem to be trying to pass this book off as the truth when in fact there isn't even a Kingdom Hospital in Maine - (CMCC hospital is the one utilized in this series). Yes this story is simply the thinly (VERY thinly) changed story of Riget (i.e. the Kingdom) and Riget II brilliantly written and directed by Lars von Trier in 1994 and 1997 respectively. When I contacted Zentropa studios with my concern they said that the rights to Riget and Riget II had been sold to the television series but not the accreditation. They too are obviously waiting for ABC to make the proper acknowledgement.Given this I would pass on the book and instead see the wonderful von Trier originals. As socrates 17 saysit is possible to find Riget in PAL format from Amazon UK although in my case I was lucky enough to find it in a now defunct video store in NTSC format. Riget II is occasionally shown on tv - IFC showed it about a year ago and one of the pay channels (STARZ I think) showed it this past fall. Definately check these von Trier films out; they are uniquely plotted wonderfully shot and acted and I still have the images of Udo Kier (as the monstrous baby) in my mind. ",1.0

It is flat with no real suspense unless you count the question 'Was this really written by Stephen King?' as part of the book. It is pretty far off in its depiction of the paranormal beginning with the ants. If this is King's work he has succeeded at seeming to be a complete amateur. If it is Druse's why is it a work of fiction? Sorry this book makes me 'harrumph.' I wish I'd bought something else. ",1.0
" I am quite upset with the reviewer who says no one in this country has heard of Lars Von Trier. Many people have. Bjork has even been in one of his movies gimme a break! This book seems just a fictional tie in to Stephen King's series and the money used to buy it would be better seen going to buy the original Kingdom by Von Trier. I am currently watching King's version but I hope none of his viewers think this was totally his idea or that it is real. I am not saying one Kingdom is better than the other I only wish viewers to educate themselves by watching Von Trier's version too and not making such sweeping judgements that Americans are too stupid to read subtitles or enjoy a TV series from another country!Having said this I am sure King's fans will enjoy it if it is read as a fiction. Maybe some of Lars Von Trier fans will like it too. I just higly recommend seeing both and then deciding which you like more. And yes Kingdom 2 aired a few months ago on IFC so it is accessible...you can also get a copy of Kingdom 1 on VHS. ",1.0
" Journals is nothing more than a teaser for the upcoming ABC movie. The story is not original and frankly much of it doesn't even make sense.

After the Ellen Rimbauer dud and now this one I wonder if King has lost his spark. His writings have in the past always had an edge that made you wonder what was going on in his head.

" First off its in Japanese and didn't come with subtitles (at least for kindle) . Girls get attacked by evil ninjas women who spend most of the movie beating and choking the heroes. The action scenes are right out of 1970's scripted wrestling. Our heroins get punched knocked to the ground and kicked repeatedly (usually in the head) then get up and run away. I suppose that getting punched and kicked for 5-10 minutes and not being hurt is easily possible since it hardly ever looked like any of the blows made contact.This movie has no nudity sexuality or real plot. Its just a long poor mock combatfest that actually makes the Power Rangers look realistic by comparison. Save the precious minutes of your life by NEVER watching this! ",1.0
" This book is garbage plain and simple. William Still takes the unusual tactic of investigating secret society activity through a fundamental Christian perspective. This could have led to interesting results but this book comes nowhere close. I am not trying to criticize Still's beliefs but he clearly comes from the religious tradition that believes that any sort of behavior that does not agree with his theology 100% is 'satanist'. In fact he condemns his subject matter as 'satanist' or 'satanism' so many times that the judgement loses its force very quickly. Still also comes from the branch of Christianity that feels that all persons or ideas that do not comply with those fundamental beliefs to the letter are part of a vast conspiracy seeking to crush Christian beliefs. Once again Still's personal beliefs are his right but he has such a clear contempt for his subject matter that he is completely unable to investigate it in any useful fashion. Just when he is on the verge of unveiling useful information about the actions of secret societies each time he collapses into tired religious dogma.This book is not the 'investigative' journalism that Still tries to tell you it is. I'll give him a little credit for trying but he fails. He is completely unable to see around his personal hatred and contempt for his subject.... ",1.0
" The author writes this book from a fundamentalist biblical perspective which makes it like trying to argue the bible with someone who continuously quotes it out of context. The antique references show the author's bias. On reading the second chapter descriptions of 'secret societies' a person who knows Egyptian history and religion cannot help but feel a twinge of pain at the outright falsity of almost everything he writes there. The same goes for the brief blurb on Gnosticism as well as most of the rest of it. Find a book that has a more balanced view of history and religious ideas and skip this one. If you consider your time of any value at all then reading this book definitely wastes it. ",1.0

So i am going to try to keep an open mind and try to go to a live one in a theater near by where maybe I will be able to see what everyone is talking about. The whole movie just left me bored and wasn't a movie that inspired my and my faith. It was cheesy to say the least. ",1.0

You're certainly not going to keep the attention of a 4 year old if it looked like it did on stage!And what's all this complaining about having the children singing and in some of the scenes. Kids enjoy seeing kids! How difficult is that to see???Okay I'll definitely agree that the Collins scene is WAY too sexed up. That was a big mistake. I find myself skipping over this scene when I'm watching with my kids. Also someone mentioned the sound problems on a home theatre and I'm seeing them too.Look Realize this very few stage shows (with the exception of Into the Woods) can be adapted to film with no changes. You're looking at a whole different kind of audience- many of which have never set foot in a REAL theatre. Give them a break they did a darn good job for what they had to work with.Oh and if you're just writing because you don't like the show- give the guy a break he was in college when he wrote it!

" This is yet another example of an excellent musical play made into a horrible movie. The original play was purposefully set in unrealistic situations but at the same time the music was of excellent quality. The movie has taken the play and turned it into a comedy that is not funny. The music has become farce. Beautiful semi-classical style music from the play has been dumbed down into cheap rock junk. The singers exaggerate emotions so much that it borders on ridiculousness. Nowhere is this more present than in the narrator's horrible exaggerated singing style. The only bright spot in this movie is Donny Osmond's singing quality. He seems to be the only actor in the movie who uses breath support while singing. ",1.0

" I am one of the few people apparently who disliked this video intensely. I remember watching a pre-Donny Osmond staging of it at a small college theater and fell in love. I bought the CD of the original production by Andrew Lloyd Weber/Time Rice and listened until I had the songs memorized. Years later I saw the Donny Osmond version and thought he did a good job of producing it. His voice was good and so were those of the other performers. The singers playing Joseph's brothers were the highlight of the experience. They were brilliant. However I was disappointed that they changed the narrator from an alto to a soprano. I also didn't like some of the constumes though I was admittedly up in the nosebleed section of his production and couldn't see the detail. The Elvis Pharoh's number was WAY overdone in the Donny Osmond's stage production.I bought this video tape to support a local theater production and figured that owning a Donny Osmond version would be better than living without one. I was wrong. The singers playing the brothers were still brilliant but that is the only good thing I can say about it. I did not like the camera work of the movie at all. I didn't like the opening and closing scenes they added feeling that it didn't add any production value. I hated most of the costumes involving Potiphar's wife and the cheerleaders in the 'Go Go Go Joseph' song. The Pharoh's scene was even more hammy than the stage production to the point of being unpalatable and most of the costumes were inappropriate. It was quite frankly a raunchy production and had my kids asking questions that needed to wait until they were older to explain. Disgusted I threw my copy out after the first viewing. ",1.0

" Having seen only Episode 1 it is certainly well-intentioned and is respectful of its subjects both in Kenya and Tanzania. But two ongoing themes of the program are a) the age-old importance of land and b) the timelessness of the African people.Concerning a) this is for the most part a fundamental misreading of African peoples across the continent reflecting a Eurocentric concern with land as opposed to a concern with people. While land has long been a scarce resource in Europe owing to centuries of overpopulation and a feudal system that equated land with wealth the African continent was until the nineteenth century relatively underpopulated. Land was plentiful. What was important was that which was scarce",1.0
" Why not use the names in the common scripture that we are all familiar with . . Noah Shem Ham and Canaan. In particular rather than use the name of Canaan who was cursed by Noah (implying that all Canaanites were cursed) another name was used. Whether this odd assortment of names (going back to a previous scriptural translation) was done to be cute or if there was a more sinister reason it was at the least an annoyance.Another issue that I found disturbing was the painting of Noah as a tyrant to his family. He may have had reverence for the Almighty but he was shown to be a mean fellow particularly to his wife. The reason that he and his family were chosen above all others to be survivor of the deluge was not made clear. Noah may not have had a sexual appetite for other women contrary to others in the story who did but was that reason enough for him to survive?In Scripture there is no mention of any authority given to Noah to invite others to go with him. He is clearly commanded to take only his wife and children and their wives. But he tells others that if they would have a good heart they would be allowed to come with him. This is another flaw and a serious one I believe. Why did Noah assume the sin of pride in showing others that he had the power to bring them along even if no one took him up on it?This was a poorly thought-out story. It is a fairy tale within a fairy tale and it just didn't work for me. The facts are not all correct and the underlying impetus for the entire episode of the flood is not shown clearly. I tend to think that the reasons for writing such a book changing the names particularly not acknowledging Canaan and Canaanites as the cursed of Scripture is more a promotion of a revisionist way of treating the subject and of treating the Old Testament than an interesting take on legend. Sunday schools should concentrate on readings from Scripture until something comes along that makes more sense and that is more honest than this attempt. ",1.0

" So I'm at the video store the other day and the manager tells me this new movie that was banned in Germany just came in and that it was supposed to be uberly kewl and I needed to check it out. Didn't look like my kind of flick but I figured I'd give it a look.Wow.I have seen a lot of REALLY bad movies over the years but this is truly in a class of its own. To call it a 'film' would be inaccurate. There is no plot. It seems to have been shot in a single take on a VHS camera using recycled tapes as I've seen far better resolution from cheapo camera phones. The 'blood' isn't even red -- it looks like coffee either being splashed from a cup or squirted out of a tube. The 'intestines' hanging out of an abdomenal wound appear to be constructed from blue sweatpants. The makeup f/x seem to have been handled by autistic jr high students with ADD . . . either that or they just didn't care. Oh and the story sucked too. Some nonsense about 'Your uncle was killed by a drunk driver and if you join our gang we'll kill the drunk's whole family for you.'I struggled to endure this 'film' until about 5 minutes into the first fight where the fellow who just received serious gunshot wounds through both thighs proceeded to chase the shooter around and kick him -- then the gun was taken away and he shot the shooter -- whereupon the shooter pops open the hatchback of his car and pulls out a small chainsaw (already running) to counterattack -- and his victim then proceeds to grasp the bar of said chainsaw (as well as the sharp spinning chain) with both hands sustaining not so much as a papercut . . . after watching a few more minutes of this stupidity I realized that I couldn't even fast forward through the remaining 90% of the 'film' so I instead pressed the 'chapter advance' button repeatedly and saw that it was pretty much the same throughout.To add insult to injury the perpetrator of this cinematic dog dropping actually had the audacity to add 'Special Features' to the disc in which he pontificates about his vision and philosophy . . . for which he should be beaten with a large stick . . . even though there were no subtitles for the Special Features and I can't understand German. I see this 'film' was released in 1999 and I wonder at which fast food franchise the Writer/Director now toils?This is the Worst Movie Ever Made. And it isn't even funny. I skipped through most of it AND got a full refund yet I still feel as if I've been wronged. I would rather get kicked in the groin repeatedly than be forced to watch this 'film' in its entirety. Beyond awful. ",1.0

" This has got to be one of the worst attempts at ethnography by a supposed native (yeah like 'Adams' is a really Persian surname) that I have ever read.The author lies throughout the entire book. He claims to have been raised in a Nestorian Christian community in Persia but to have never been exposed to the Bible except through an outsider(!). He is obviously completely ignorant of the Qu'ran which he never quotes but that doesn't stop him from making the most outrageous statements about Persian culture and claiming that 'The Koran [sic] tells them to do it.' He claims that the peoples' inherent fatalism prevents them from seeking remedies against disease as that disease is supposed to be due to the will of God then in the very next paragraph he goes on about how ignorant and ineffectual the remedies of the local doctors are!Such bald-faced duplicity is due to the massive axe Adams has to grind.

" From the opening scenes where Ma Sackett is poorly acted by Mercedes McCambridge to the final wornout cliche scene where the heroes emerge unscathed by thousands of bullets shot at them to stride manly-man style down main street this made for TV movie is a waste of time and money. The story jumps haphazardly from plotline to plotline and cuts from some scenes without ever resolving where the scene was headed. A girl in a thin dress and no supplies survives for 2 years in mountains that kill experienced mountain men with sudden snows! Are you kidding me? Kid Newton is ridiculous as the arch evil bad guy. Tom Selleck leaves home and heads west without so much as a slicker or bedroll. Glen Ford turns from good guy to bad guy with little or no explanation other than he was a lawyer in New Orleans. Louis L'Amour's introduction was banal brief and boring. I could not believe actors of this quality and experience would allow this movie to be released. They were obviously gathered for their star power thrown together in a hastily and poorly written screen adaptation of two pretty good books and mis-directed by Robert Totten. Shame on all of them!

" I am a big fan of Tom Selleck and Sam Elliott. I bought this DVD because of them and the glowing reviews. I have to say that I didn't enjoy this one at all for many reasons.I watched the first hour before I gave up on it and did not find one scene to be memorable or engrossing. The characters were all stereotypes with no real development to make them real. Tom Selleck's character lacked all the touches that made his other characters special. The plot was typical cowboy cliches. The soundtrack was loud extremely dated and annoying.I could sit and watch all eight hours of Lonesome Dove at one time or a dozen hours of Deadwood. I didn't even bother to finish watching this and I don't feel like I missed anything. If it had been good enough to keep watching I would have given it two stars.Oh well back to Quigley Down Under Crossfire Trail and Monte Walsh for me. ",1.0
" I can not understand these raving reviews. The comparison to Lonesome Dove makes me almost as queasy as this series. The acting by Sam Eliot was over the top. Lifetime relationships were formed and broken in minutes over the most trivial of things. The character played by Tom Selleck loses a wife and is tomcatting in the next five minutes.I did not know whether to laugh or cry with the cardboard characters portrayed by the mother and the dumb blond Selleck fell in love with. The ending was lame and anti climatic. Veteran actors such as Glen Ford/Slim Pickens/John Vernon/etc reduced to Monty Python status. Did these people really see westerns such as Lonesome Dove or Broken Trail or Unforgiven or The Outlaw Josey Wales or The GoodThe Bad and the Ugly just to name a few???

" The bible practices animal sacrifice and it's inherently anti-compassion anti-animal rights anti-women's rights. The very name of this book is anti-compassion anti-respect. Dominion. To dominate someone or to have dominion over them is an act of violence. Usually the vicious fight for dominance not gentle powerful guardians. To try to dominate someone is to try to use aggressive force to control them. Guardian is a very powerful word the word includes respect for animals and uses gentle as possible methods to protect them and consider their needs and desires as we would any creature we have power over - like our own children. Always the powerful should respect those they have power over because it's just luck that you have it - and you should grieve for those that don't have it and try to give your power to others. All good to all beings. Dominance is the abuse of power. The men who love the bible like to dominate women also and they would have us connect our sexual desires only to the endless dichotomy of dominion and submission of dogs versus the goodness and equality of love.I think the bible is the most cruel and stupid book ever written. It's the philosophy of one hand clapping the philosophy of Nothing - slavery is freedom cruelty and chlid/animal sacrifice is love love is gentle and kind but oh no love is actually your children being tortured to death in horrific sacrifices to the demands a 'god' who is uh... likely a predator bio-tech jerk. Wake up. Phelps is probably really akin to Fred Phelps and this crap is probably paid for by the pyramid scheme of predation - the new trend is to write books about love and hide things about male or white supremacy in them torture and abuse horrible cruelty of all kinds write a book about animal rights and slither in some anti-animal rights propaganda etc... I'm pretty sure this author is enemy propaganda and is attempting to ease you in that direction. Avoid Christianity Pagan religions that ease you into animal abuse and all religion that practices male supremacy white supremacy animal torture or child torture and sacrifice - real animals and children suffer in these religions. There have been many children genuinely sacrificed and 'martyred' in Christianity just so some male supremacist jerks can secure more power for their greedy selves. It's not enough you've been given greater size and physical strength in general but also must control all governments religions family life - everything. Back off and learn some generosity. Voodoo also genuinely harms animals as well as tribal religions that practice animal sacrifice hunting rituals etc...I think religion can be an act of aggression - and many religions are in fact just traps that are very cruel. I'd love to see a religion some day that genuinely opposes the suppression and slavery of women child abuse animal abuse and the worship of the creators of this bio-tech pyramid scheme of predation. I do not believe that the people who created this world are in any way good. The snake and the tree of knowledge is meant to scare you from the truth about the knowledge of good and evil for were you to discover it you would discover that the creators are PREDATORS WHO CREATE PREDATORS and are no different from any other child rapists slave owners and cruel tyrants - they are evil.

I am interested in hearing from any other buyers that have had this problem and if anything can be done about it short of returning it and trying another brand.I would consider getting a HD DVD player or Blu-ray which also claim to upconvert older DVD's but I am reluctant to believe them after this Pioneer upconverter experience.

I'll make sure that Jonathon Taylor pays for betraying the WWE by getting this album and giving it five stars when it absolutely deserves a zero.As spokenVincent Kennedy McMahonP.S if you think that you Jonathon are going to get away with this then you better think again because you've got no chance no chance....in hell!

" Almost a year after it's initial release and because of the horror of September 11 this hack singer [yeah right] / songwriter [oh please] had the biggest selling piece of tripe of her career with the abhorrent 'A Day Without Rain' a dismal cacophony of synths and ooze that the world seemed to grasp onto as a sign of distorted comfort. Well she's back...and as misguided as ever. More quasi-Celtic schmaltz juxtaposed with her archaic wheeze of a voice it took 5 years to come up with this monstrosity. She's an insult to the true musical aesthete. My grade",1.0

Maybe I'm too old fashion but making up a language along the way just to get the sounds..... In one cut the same sounds (as they are not words) are repeated so many times I thought the CD player was stuck. I got up and gave it a wack.

" Having been a long time fan like so many other enya listeners this latest album proved to me that Enya has lost the 'spark' that made her the new age star that she is. I agree with all the other reviewers when they say that this album along with 'A day without Rain' are merely rehashed versions of her older albums. In my opinion The Memory of Trees was her last great and original album that blew me away. Orinocco Flow Shepard Moons the Celts and Memory of Trees all had its own uniqueness and took listeners to a brand new world of Enya each time it was released. Songs like Book of Days Memory of Trees Orinocco Flow Alderbaran were some of the examples of Enya's masterpieces. Unfortunately when 'A Day without Rain' came out I was disappointed to hear the same type of beat that Memory of Trees had used repeated in that new album. Unlike her other albums i quickly put 'A Day without Rain' to rest and hoped for Enya to inspire us once again in her future album. Now that Amarantine is out it has made me a very sad fan to see that Enya and her team has really lost the magic and are simply using the same tones to make new songs. I for one still remain an Enya fan despite the fact. If you are a die hard enya fan and A day without Rain didn't bother you then maybe you will enjoy this album. But if you agree with my above statement about her previous album you'll probably wanted to spent the money elsewhere like Moya Brennan Enya's sister's new album is a nice refreshing sound. ",1.0

" After a five-year interval Enya disappoints with her weakest album to date. I have been a devoted admirer of the Irish singer since 'Orinoco Flow' first hit the airwaves years ago and have eagerly awaited each and every offering including her singles which oftentimes contain extra bonus tracks that turn out to be mini-masterpieces. I understand how many critics brush her aside claiming that her music is too artificial too cold too computer generated to stir genuine emotions and with those criticisms I strongly disagree until now. True you buy an Enya album because it sounds like an Enya album. No matter how many years go by in between songs are frequently interchangeable from one CD to the next and that's okay. Enya's strength lies in the perfect blending of her unique voice and her music and the magic that she creates with them in the studio-intricate spider's webs of fragile melodies and haunting refrains.But the magic is absent from 'Amarantine'.The entirety of the album's brief 45 minute running time is to put it simply exceedingly dull. Instead of spirited otherworldly evocative songs this album flows by lugubriously and depressingly. The songs are pallid and barely stick in the brain. Only the title track-a word whose definition along with being a vibrant shade of red means to be everlastingly youthful or beautiful-has sparks of that once Enya allure. Even the lone instrumental piece 'Drifting' is ponderous and pales in the light of other such previous wordless tracks as 'A Day Without Rain' 'Tea House Moon' or 'Watermark'.Enya's 'sound' is also different. True there's nothing wrong with expanding or growing as an artist but as the old saying goes",1.0
" Look I like Enya...I really do. I have all of her CDs and play them a lot but come on folks this CD is nothing but lukewarm leftovers. There's not a single 'classic' Enya track. The songs are too slow and too depressing. What did somebody close to her die during the five years it took to put this way-too-short offering out? I don't want to hear Enya singing about gloom and doom. Sure some of her other songs are 'sad' but not like this! This album's not varied at all except for that silly 'Riverdance' ditty in some fictious language created by Roma Ryan. Ms. Ryan's lyrics are often terribly juvenile...does she sleep with a rhyming dictionary next to her bed? All that's missing is moon spoon and June not to mention the fact that a lot of lines are grammatically incorrect and some don't even scan correctly when sung or that there is no such word as 'amarantine'!! Where's that old Enya magic? Is this Enya evolving into the 'new' Enya? And if this is the 'new' Enya this is a step backward. This one's sub-par no matter what the 'real' Enya fans say...and ya know what? If you really are a REAL Enya fan you know that this one's not great...we were all just starving after half a decade of waiting looking forward to another masterpiece like 'Book of Days' 'Only Time' or 'Caribbean Blue' and Enya threw us an old soup bone. I hope that Father Christmas leaves a huge lump of coal in Enya's stocking this year in payback for this lump of cold Irish stew. ",1.0
" I have been a long-time admirer of Enya's gorgeous work for many years. Her celestial melodies unique arrangements and singular voice have provided me with hours of listening pleasure for more than a decade. But as the years and her albums have come and gone there is one glaring truth about Enya's work that has become ever more apparent--that her growth as an artist has been disturbingly minimal at best. Of course this is not to say that her recordings have not progressed in any way. Her otherwordly sound and image have become ever more slick. But such advancement is growth on a lateral level at most--one must assume this being the result of an effort to secure her worldwide legion of fans with a predictable output one that will guarantee her placment as #1 on the New Age charts for years at a time. Even so each of Enya's previous albums have offered more than a few memorable tracks that remain enjoyable after years of playing. So 'Amarantine' is a terrible disappointment in its almost total lack of anything worthwhile save for what amounts to less than a handful of at best mediocre pieces. And so lacklustre not to mention brief is the album overall that it borders on insult to fans who have waited more than five years since her last major release. So routine are the songs on 'Amarantine' as to resemble nothing more than alternate versions of previously released tracks--these being the ones that were wisely dropped. But in the end none of these criticisms will really matter much to Enya's cult who will embrace this album with stars in their eyes and a total lack of discrimination in their ears. I must admit if I found a way to make enough millions to afford me a splendid life in a spectacular castle as Enya has through her music machine I too would churn out such unchallenging dreck as this latest release as well. But I would hope not have the audacity to call myself a musical artist. Perhaps 'sausage-maker tunesmith' has more of a ring of truth to it. Congratulations Enya keep smiling that vacant and knowing smile. You've fooled almost everyone. ",1.0

" I just heard about this cd last night and I was very interested in hearing the clips. Once I did I realized how important it is to cover Rage and have a guitar player who can figure out the sounds and a singer that sounds like Zack. The singer on those clips had no energy and didn't sound like Zack at all. That ruined it for me because the music actually sounded really close to the real thing. I don't understand why they'd have a tribute cd and try to sound exactly like the band when we can just go buy the albums of the real band. ",1.0
" There were no ideas that were not developed by the 1960's in this book. There were a lot of stereotypical 'war stories' of stuttering. The old mantra of self-esteem which is being proven scientifically false over and over is trotted out and delved into at length. Additionally a lot of work is spent on relaxation technigues coupled with manipulating the way you think about things (called framing in the book). Basically the author encourages one to 'get over it'. There are some slick new acronyms such as PWS (the person who stutters!!!) but come on...no advancement.I'd encourage interested readers to check out the Valsalva techniques found in other books such as by William Parry.

He also has to take the obligatory slap at McCarthy without bothering to admit that 'we now know' (the title of another Gaddis work) that declassified material has largely shown that he told the truth and his detractors consistently lied.

" Silly jingoistic pulp history shot through with half truths unsupported and unsupportable claims and distortions. John Lewis Gaddis is a history professor at Yale University but how he can draw so many stupid conclusions from the Cold War is beyond me. Nobody in their right mind would say that Stalin was a nice democratic leader nor would they be likely to say his successors were freedom loving liberals either but the standard neo-con treatment these days is to score points with heavy handed jingoism rather than presenting history as it happened. I'm sorely tempted to call it propaganda.The layout of the book is extremely poor and jumps from one thing to another without any real semblance of method. You will find yourself reading about Stalin one minute then Kruschev the next and finally back to Stalin again. Very confusing and giving the appearance that he has something of an obsession with Stalin.His assertion that the US achieved its amazing industrial power due to a lack of Government intervention is a neo-con line which is not supported in fact. Most US Government war contracts were designed to fulfil Government specifications. His claim that Americans in 1945 lived in the freest society on the planet is unsupportable. Obviously he has never been to Australia New Zealand or Eire. When he said nobody knows how the Berlin Blockade started I couldn't believe my eyes! Both Hilton and Taylor explain it in their respective books on the Berlin Wall.He spends barely a page on the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 and scarcely bothers to explain that the missiles were installed because of fears that the US would invade after the attempted Bay of Pigs invasion the year before. Asserting that this information has only just been released from Soviet archives does nothing for the argument. Blind Freddy could have seen that.When the Soviets or the Chinese cracked down on insurgencies in their own territories or those of a client state Gaddis digs deep for another triumphant assertion that the US never did this but does not concede that the states they supported most certainly did especially the dictatorships they cheerfully installed in Central and South America. Later in the book he does point out the activities undertaken by the CIA in South America but it's scarcely relevant.All the US leaders were great",1.0

I wasn't intoxicated while using these but they are more difficult to open than our usual durex and sometimes magnums.The fit on these is tight specifically the girth. While the material is very thin I can feel the restriction and it is distracting. The length is average and adequate.Worst of all these lost all lubrications in 5-10 minutes. Twice I had to apply extra lubrication (think baby powder dry) and the most recent time I just gave up and called it a night.Shipping was fairly prompt from the seller but the questionable packaging small fit (must have done their product testing in Asia) and extreme lack of lubrication make these the worst condom I have ever used.

" Awful experience with the seller 'Green Web Inc.'. I placed an order on Nov. 14 but never received my item. I contacted the seller on November 19. I got a response on November 21. They informed me that there was an 'unexpected' delay. I contacted them again to say that I would not cancel my order if they were 100% sure I could get my item by December 3 almost 3 weeks after I placed the order (I am patient). They said ok. Then on November 28 I received an email from Amazon confirming the item had shipped. On December 4 as I had not received anything I contacted the seller again. They answered on Dec. 5 and explained that the item would leave their facility the same day (Dec. 5). What??? They told Amazon they had shipped my item on November 28! Would they be liars?? Probably. Why? Well so you don't cancel your order.I filed a claim w/ Amazon on Dec. 5. This seller doesn't have (all?) his products in stock and doesn't communicate honestly.

" The original Outrun is a timeless classic. It's one of those video-games that will last forever and it came out of the golden era of wonderful arcade innovations along with Double Dragon and Splatterhouse. Outrun was the first great racer better than Pole Position on the Atari!!!There have been plenty of sequels and spin-offs to Outrun from the kinda okay Turbo Outrun to the just plain stupid Battle Outrun. None really had that extra spark which made the original so amazing. Outrun 2006 may not end up a classic but is still a brilliant game in it's own right.Rekindling that hedonistic free-spirited just-get-in-and-drive-anywhere feeling and sacrificing all the modern racing features for just sheer joyriding pleasure Outrun 2006 is just such an easily accessible game for anyone.As usual it's filled with gorgeous scenery brilliantly blue skies and amazing music. The classic 'Magical Sound Shower' (a great great tune indeed) has been remixed but it also contains the 1986 mix for the purists.The only negative thing I can say about this game is that once you've finished it 5 times (such as I have already) there's not much point in going back to the same old courses. They could have included more.Ah well it's still a game you should invest time and money in.Graphics ASound AGameplay ALasting Appeal C+ ",3.0

I think it may have mads an interesting documentary for older kids who had liked Thomas as small children but for little kids it does not hold their interest long enough to get to the next story.

These are not just Thomas stories but a mixture of episodes supposedly picked by children who went to the A Day With Thomas event in Penn. at some point.

You cannot skip these with the skip button; you can fast-forward but that's a hassle isn't it? This is why some customers are understandably upset.But my two-year-old actually likes the footage from the event -- set to his favorite T&F; songs -- more than the stories themselves. Most of his favorite episodes are not here so he ends up only watching the event footage and clapping every time he sees the mock-up Thomas train with all the happy children onboard.If you own few other Thomas videos I think this is a decent value with ten episodes that more or less represent the T&F; series. That is pretty much every episode finds the engines 'cross' -- I'm starting to get real sick of that word! ",3.0
" I would have enjoyed it more if the hero had some other powers other then being able to read minds which by the way he's not very good at it.Or he should have been able to read the minds of who was betraying him and trying to kill him & his new bride. When the plot seems to be in trouble with no way out he can read thoughts. And only when the heroine is distressedor in trouble. Who only questions him about his ability after she's married to him. And she keeps getting into trouble because he won't tell her anything just keeps patting her on the head and telling her not to worry he will protect her. Which he also doesn't do to well. The plot is long and at times boring. I hope Ms. Feehan stays with her paranormal charactars. ",3.0
" As an avid reader of Christine Feehan I was pretty excited when 'Scarletti Curse' was published. Unfortunately the novel did not live up to expectations. Unlike Feehan's earlier novels these characters were not well-developed and the plot was relatively shallow. There were flashes of Feehan's characteristic imagination but over all it was a disappointing read. ",3.0
" For many years the Scarletti family history has been shrouded in curses and dark mysteries. Whispers of evil murder and insanity have been going around the villagers about the family that rules their lands. They say that no bride has ever survived in the palazzo and considering the number of women who have met their untimely death in what everyone has come to refer to as the Palazzo Della Morte (Palace of Death) it seemed that the curse is true.Unbeknown to the villagers the current don has set his eyes on their healer Nicoletta the woman whose identity they have protected for fear that she will be branded a witch by those who might misinterpret her gift of healing. So how did Don Giovanni Scarletti find out about their beloved Nicoletta when no one has spoken of her to outsiders? Could the rumor be true then that he has powers because he is in league with the devil?THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a dark and mysterious novel filled with suspense and sensuality. Nicoletta is a very likable heroine with her wit and exuberance. I loved the way she seemed to embrace life with such open arms. Her compassionate nature and youthful innocence is quite endearing. Giovanni's character is such a mystery. The way he treats Nicoletta with such tenderness is such a contrast from how people perceived him to be.I must say though that even though the author has done well in describing the atmosphere within the palazzo including the design and architecture lending to the eeriness of the story there were some parts that dragged a bit. I also didn't care much about the political intrigue and thought that it wasn't blended in well with the story. I might have understood it more had the author bothered to actually tell us which date the story was meant to have happened (I'm only guessing 15th or 16th century). I know this seems trivial but when I'm reading a historical novel I do like to know what period it's supposed to be.Overall this wasn't a bad book. I did enjoy the banter between the don and his barefoot bride. You can read about Giovanni and Nicoletta's descendant Antonietta Scarletti in Dark Symphony (which I'm reading at the moment). ",3.0
" This was a great book! But the dialogue between Nicoletta and her guardian just seem to drag on forever! I missed the intense dialogue that Feehan usually devotes to the two leads. It seemed that they had very little interaction except for the last 1/4 of the book. Why such devotion to this mother-daughter relationship when it didn't seem to lead to anything crucial within the story? It really detracted from the couple's story. Other than that the two leads were great and I agree with previous entrys - PLEASE write a book on the other brothers. ",3.0
" At first it was interesting because the character Nicoletta was a free spirit who vowed never to be married to anyone who would subject her to abuse or become servile to. It was when she met Don Giovanni Scarletti she sensed something evil about him and his family. Don Scarletti had possession of her mind body and soul. His dark features were erotic yet frightening to Nicoletta. However I have found myself getting a little bored with the book. It seems as if something that is bound to happen doesn't happen. It's a good read but unfortunately I am getting restless and impatient with the Scarletti curse and the passionate fires between Nicoletta and Don Giovanni. ",3.0

Ms. Feehan seems to have a preference for characters with dark hair and eyes. I need a little more variety please! Ms. Feehan also writes her main female characters to fight desperately for their independence throughtout the book knowing that they will not end against their brooding possessive Hero. I get tired of the constant whining and carrying on. But it seems that the females also go through some magical personality transformation after the first sex scene. I know sex is good but come on.

" I enjoy Ms Feehan's general writing style and loved every one of the Dark Series books...but this gothic started very slow. For over a hundred pages I still felt like the background was still being set and the real story hadn't begun. Finally she gets to the gothic mansion and I felt that THAT is when the story began. Once at this point the plot seems to take up some speed and has a lot of suspense and gothic darkness. Although some questions are answered I felt like she could have taken some of the characters a bit further. I also felt like some of the scenes were startlingly switched for the suspense and I had to go back and re-read a page again to figure out what was going on. I wouldn't re-read this again but would still probably want to try her next gothic to see how that one goes. ",3.0
" I guess I was expecting more. I would like to establish that I love the Dark series and cannot get enough of them. This book however left a bit lacking. I thought ... was going to make more out of the paranormal relationship between the two main characters. I felt this never developed like I wanted it too. I didn't feel Nicoletta was a very interesting character at all and lacked the strength of her previous lead characters. .... There was a lot of build up with not enough punch. If you like the Dark series I would recommend that you read this one if you have nothing else around to read .... ",3.0
" This book read a little too much like a toned down book from her Dark series for me to really enjoy it. Like the men in her other series the hero is laboring under a dark shadow and needs that special one woman to make his life light. He is over protective and dictatorial and the woman can't help but want him. The fact that the curse was healed with a little pop psychology did not help the book either. It is still a pleasurable read but it is not one I wanted to repeat. ",3.0
" I am realtively new to Christine Feehan and have really enjoyed all of her 'Dark' series. This was the first gothic novel I've read in quite some time. I must say that while the book was diverting it was not one of my favorites by Feehan. I didn't find Nicoletta to be all that sympathetic. There were also a lot of minor characters with many names that the reader has to keep straight.Also while Nicoletta's supernatural powers were explained pretty well one never really gets to understand why Giovanni has them or where they come from.But all of that being said it was creepy and certainly kept me reading. I was still thinking about the book this morning as I woke up so that's something. While I wouldn't recommend this book as being one of her best it is certainly an entertaining read. ",3.0

" This release made a big impact for the Wilson Sisters and company. The four singles are all quite good and even some of the album tracks Nobody Home in particular are fairly ear catching. Will Heart be as memorable as the Beatles Stones Eagles or Fleetwood Mac I doubt it. However they did make some noteworthy contributions to the world of rock n roll and a good portion of that is on this album. ",3.0
" While I still enjoy listening to this song 20 years after its release it is not my favourite Heart album. I believe their best work lies in the music they released in the 70's from the Dreamboat Annie Little Queen Dog and Butterfly Bebe Le Strange and Greatest Hits/Live albums.Heart can rock - they still rock to this day and the 1985 Heart album was a commercial success complete with the big hair glam make-up and power ballads but in my opinion that wasn't Heart. That was a marketing recipe for success for Capitol records. The music although entertaining radio-friendly and sometimes charged (What About Love Never If Looks Could Kill Shell Shock) is not organic or idealistic. Lyrically the songs are weak and trite and don't represent the depth and breadth of Ann and Nancy's earlier songwriting talents. Their musical catalogue on Capitol does not compare to the gems they released on the Mushroom & CBS-Portrait labels.I still listen to this album occasionally to remind me of my youth but if I want to hear the REAL Heart I listen to their earlier albums. ",3.0
" It is my opinion that Heart was never the same after the Wilson sisters dismissed lead guitarist Roger Fisher (Anne's former beau) and producer Mike Flicker. This was evident on their first album without their involvement Bebe LeStrange (80). Fisher had a co-writing credit on one track but he did not appear on the album. From that point on Heart had lost their edge. At the same time their commercial appeal was slipping. They made Private Audition (82) and Passion Works (83) but failed to have any significant hits. They were subsequently dropped from CBS (Sony) records.As a matter of survival in the record business Heart had everything riding on the success of this self-titled Capitol album. Producer Ron Nevison encouraged the Wilson sisters to use songs from outside writers and he made Heart sound like Survivor with female lead vocals. I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy most of the songs on this album. 'What About Love' 'Never' and particularly Bernie Taupin's 'These Dreams' are very catchy pop tunes. Incidentally 'These Dreams' was orignally written for Stevie Nicks who rejected it. Heart had their first number one song three more top ten singles and an additional Hot 100 hit from this record which proves my point -- this is pure pop. Of course that's not bad it's just different.For those of us who were fans from the beginning the HEART album bears little resemblance to the rocking and soulful 70's band that made the classics Dreamboat Annie (76) Little Queen (77) Magazine (78) and Dog and Butterfly (78). If you only know Heart from this 1985 pop album you owe it to yourself to hear them the way they were. ",3.0
" While this album certainly isn't the same music Heart was known for in the 70s it brought them back into the music spotlight and brought new fans. Some people who like to act self important wanna call this type of change 'selling out' but look at all the other bands of the past who refused to change - most of them are nowhere and forgotten. Very few bands of that era have a sound that maintains through time. Put 'bands of the 70s' in your search browser and see what comes up. There's maybe 5 bands on that list that continued to produce music successfully thru the 80s and 90s. And Heart is one of them. When it comes to entertainment if you wanna survive you gotta give the fans what they want. And that's what Heart did on this disc and a few more after this. ",3.0
" This is a review of the 1990 Capitol CD version of this album. In short this is a very good album but the sound quality of the CD is mediocre at best and is in need of remastering. In fact the sound quality is very weak in comparison to the excellent remastered 'Little Queen' 'Dog & Butterfly' and 'Bebe Le Strange' CDs released by Epic/Legacy. Compared to my vinyl LP purchased back when the album was first released this CD sounds quite tinny with overdone highs and a great lack of midrange.As far as the music itself this is a solid effort and was Heart's biggest seller going 5X Platinum (per Wikipedia). It was a departure from the band's earlier albums as they went through a change in record label and with that came a new producer (Ron Nevison) new sound (heavier use of synth; less use of acoustic guitar) and new songwriters (emphasis on outsiders instead of the Wilson sisters). While I prefer the older albums this is still very good and worth a listen. In fact based on relative record sales most people prefer this version of Heart to their original approach.So overall 4 stars for the music 2 stars for the sound quality giving an overall rating of 3 stars. ",3.0
" Being a huge Heart fan since the release of 'Dreamboat Annie' in 1976 I was not sure what to make of this 1985 self-titled album. While I was thrilled that the 'Heart' album was such a huge success I wondered what happend to my favorite band. They were no longer the folky blusey rockin band I grew up with - - now they were a huge hit machine with lots of pop/rock hits and huge hair. This album is however expertly executed. It accomplished its goal in spades - - turn Heart into a pop/rock hit making machine. All the songs here are good and Ann and Nancy and the band are in top form. Again proving they could play anything. However the soul is gone. ",3.0

" This is somewhat of a minority viewpoint in comparison to the previous five customer reviews already written. I read this book because of the local publicity it received here in Wisconsin the fact that I have been in Peru and in Amazon region (though not the same part as Dr. Linnea) am interested in Latin American culture and speak fluent Spanish.Dr. Linnea doesn't. The one complete Spanish sentence in the book contains a major grammar error that most students wouldn't make mid-way through their first semester of college Spanish. Of the isolated Spanish words she uses she gets a couple wrong. She can be forgiven for this. She obviously managed to communicate adequately with her patients and she's a physician after all not a linguist. I'm aware this seems like nitpicking and this is not my reason for a mere 3-star review.What I find lacking in this book is emotional engagement with the reader. I liked this book passably but wanted to like it so much more. Dr. Linnea is really the only character in it and she seems to be a rather private person. She gives us her opinions much more than her feelings. Maybe this is typical of the majority of physicians. We never really get to know her patients or any other person in the book. If she develops close relationships we don't learn of them. Some patients improve and survive some die but it's a bit like a catalogue of people who barely have names or faces and come through her office (or she goes to them). I'm also interested in medicine and geography in general and a book in a similar vein that of a doctor practicing 'backwoods medicine' that is truly wonderful (and that I'd hoped this one would resemble) is Dr. Abraham Verghese's MY OWN COUNTRY. (He treats AIDS patients in Appalachia in the mid-1980s.) Perhaps he's atypical in the way he becomes personally/emotionally involved with his patients or in the way that he is able to put human faces and lives on a disease and write about it all. Dr. Linnea in spite of being a wonderful person who has done dangerous extremely outstanding work is not able (or chooses not) to do what Verghese did in his book.Unlike another customer who reviewed this I definitely don't think this was ghost-written. Dr Linnea is right there revealing not one iota more than she wants to. I think the 'problem' can be seen right in her acknowledgements when regarding her publishers she writes that they 'gave me unlimited latitude in what I wanted to say and how I wanted to say it.' Sorry but this book needed much more editorial guidance. She's a physician not a professional writer and though this effort is quite passable it could have been so much better.The book is informative educational up to a point gives a good perspective on 'jungle' medicine' vs. the US mainstream practice thereof and is culturally sensitive. (Though at one point I winced when she said that the inhabitants almost all of whom live in abysmal poverty 'seemed happy.' This made me think of 19th century slaves in the US who many contended 'seemed happy.') There are a few funny moments especially when Dr. Linnea describes w/ dead-on accuracy her encounters with the Peruvian bureaucracy redtape and corruption.All in all well worth reading but don't expect great emotional engagement or gripping human drama.

The pin that is in the hinge constantly slips out and I have to push it back in I find it difficult to open with such a small tab and the clear cover (acrylic?) has cracked in several places. I find it quite awkward to hand out cards at a moment's notice because I have to turn it just right in order to get a good grip to open it. Nice idea but I'll be sticking to something that lasts a bit longer and is easier and quicker to open. Let your business card tell people what you do - not your case. ",3.0

" David Remnick's 'Lenin's Tomb' is a book about the journalist's experiences just before and during the collapse of the USSR at the end of the 1980s. Using a chronological overview Remnick describes what the Soviet Union was like under the reign of Gorbachov (or 'Gorbachev' in US spelling) and his views on the various leaders journalists KGB officers bureaucrats dissidents and so on.Because Remnick goes almost entirely by interviews for his information the book gives a very thorough biographical view of the times but there is very little information on the general state of the country economic and social causes for the collapse and so on. Remnick's tone and style are very much like those of a tabloid investigative journalist describing people and events mostly by way of the author's opinions and what the people he interviews look and act like. This has the benefit of giving one the impression of re-living the interactions with the famous of those years but is far too shallow for any explanatory purpose.Additionally Remnick has too obvious favorites among the people involved. Gorbachov is generally shown more negatively than often in the West but that fits the overall negative appraisal given to him in Russia. But people like Yeltsin and Solzhenitsyn are praised endlessly and can practically do no wrong even though there are serious issues with both. Sakharov in particular is elevated literally to the level of a modern saint by Remnick",3.0
" Remnick tells a good story (or more accurately a series of short personalized stories) of the last days of the Soviet Empire.

I spoke with an individual in customer support who stated the average probe lasts approximately one year then needs to be replaced(an error message comes up rendering the unit unusable).

" It seems that once a month we get a re-packaging of Little Richard's 1964-65 recordings. The latest but not greatest set of retreads is the above-named CD.The only selling point for Richard collectors in the uncommon mix on 'My Wheels They Are Slippin' All The Way' [aka 'My Wheel's Been Slippin''] the Country Rock number originally left on the shelf for ten years. The horn section is audible on this album opener. Track two 'It Ain't Whatcha Do' is the original flip-side of his third single for the label an under-produced dance floor offer and this reduced echo version is welcome.It's been said many times that Richard's work for this label is inconsistent but that doesn't mean that several sides aren't absolutely essential listening for *any* R & R fan or historian. There are a few masterpieces including the uptempo 'Dance What You Wanna' (co-written by Sam Cooke) and 'Talkin' ' bout Soul' (written by Sam's Manager and Richard's Manager-to-be J. W. Alexander). On the ballad side we have the monumental 'I Don't Know What You've Got But It's Got Me' the Don Covay composition recorded by LR in New York City May 1965 and including support by Jimi Hendrix (then known as Maurice James) Billy Preston and Don himself on harmony vocal. Incredibly the most important track on this double CD and maybe the most important Soul ballad every released is presented here with an unnecessary fade which excludes the expolsive final forty seconds.

Some of the remarks and anecdotes are very interesting but virtually all of them assume that you are already familiar with the plot of the particular story or novel. This is why I recommend it only for die-hard fans. It is no help at all for the reader who has read only a couple of Heinlein's works. I think there should have been at least a basic plot synopsis for each item so those folks could have been pointed to Heinlein pieces that would have been new to them that they might have found interesting.No work not even Starship Troopers or Strangers in A Strange Land gets more than three or four pages of comments (most are less than a page) and the book is only about 250 pages long.

" 'Hum Saath-Saath Hain' is reminiscent of some of the other family-centered Hindi dramas of the 1990s such as 'Hum Aapke Hain Kaun' and it preceded the very popular 'Khabi Khushi Khabhie Gham' which deals with similar themes. These themes are family unity; obedience to parents; loyalty to siblings; and the potential for family erosion when doubt and suspicion creep in.The family at the core of this film is comprised of mother father and three sons who all live happily together and work for the prosperous family business (there's also a daughter but she's already married and therefore lives with her husband's family). The family functions according to a strict but loving hierarchy in which the eldest son Vivek (Mohnish Behl) marries first and is set to inherit the top position in the family firm; the second son Prem (Salman Khan) is sent abroad to study so that he can also join the company; and the youngest son Vinod (Saif Ali Khan) is mischievous but always looks up to his elder brothers.The first two hours of this three hour film are without any major family strife or drama - the focus is on the daily functioning of the family and the pairing off of each brother with his respective sweetheart. Vivek Prem and Vinod all get engaged in turn as the couples sing dance and bat their eyelashes at each other over the course of two hours. When Preeti bakes sweets for Prem (his favorite sweets of course!) that counts as high drama. If the intricacies of life in an extended family hold no interest for you then you will likely be bored to tears. If however you enjoy delicate flirtations and the visual feast that is Hindi cinema then it will be a pleasant two hours.The twist doesn't come until the final hour. When the daughter of the family experiences some difficulties in her husband's home the mother becomes paranoid that a similar schism will occur in her own family carefully balanced as it is between three brothers and their three wives-to-be. In a moment of doubt the mother causes the very schism she's afraid of but under the pretense of protecting her two younger sons from the power of the elder (who's also only their half-brother). I'm not giving away anything shocking when I say that all will be resolved in the end since the very foundation of this film is the idea that family bonds should never be broken and this family in particular is unbreakable.All of the actors turn in fine performances; surprisingly no one actor is the star over any other. Salman Khan plays the shy gentle brother and as such his performance is more subdued than usual. Mohnish Behl is great as the always-responsible noble elder brother and Saif Ali Khan is credible as the playful responsibility-dodging youngest brother. The three women (Tabu Sonali Bendre and Karishma Kapoor) are lovely but they don't have much scope for nuance in their roles; they are all dutiful loving women who act appropriately and obediently. Not much room for drama in such idealized characterizations.In summary",3.0

" This guy is almost cut like Schwarzenegger but has no sense of humor. Decent action like some of Arnold's early works (e.g. Commando and Red Heat) but not the best acting just like them. If you got a couple hours to blow and want to see a new action movie this will fit the bill. I suggest rental as this does not have alot of replayability in my book. Even my two young stepsons that were Marines weren't impressed. A good popcorn no brainer action movie. If you own any of Schwarzenegger's movies your time would be better spent watching them again. Don't get me wrong I really hope that Cena's career in movies will continue. With time I'm sure his acting will improve as Schwartzenegger's did. Let's face it the movie had potential if the acting was better or they threw in more comedy. About the only funny thing in the movie was when one of the bad guys says 'He's like the Terminator' when talking about the Marine and then Robert Patrick who played a Terminator in 'Terminator 2' gives a steely glance at him. If this turns out to be the only movie Cena makes I have to vote for 'Chill Factor' with Skeet Ulrich or 'Firestorm' with Howie Long over this one. If they had added in more humor I think it would have worked better.Story Synopsis",3.0

" The Marine is a film about a marine that has just been discharged and is back home with his wife. When she's kidnapped by the bad guys the game is on. It's an action movie and I think most people can spot what this movie is going to be like from that description. So if you're not a person that enjoys action movies like Rambo or Commando then I can safely say that you won't enjoy this film. It's still a paint-by-numbers affair so it's doubtful you'd suddenly find yourself enjoying this type of film.But I am someone who enjoys action movies like Rambo and Commando. So I waited till I found myself in the right mood to watch an action romp and I stuck this DVD in. The movie starts out with some promise. After John Cena's character is discharged from the military he takes a job as a security guard. The scene that followed that was fairly entertaining - with Cena throwing around his weight. While that scene is entertaining it is also meant to show that Cena's character is miserable outside of marine life. This hints at some inner turmoil that is then left behind completely and never again brought up in the film.Robert Patrick does a great job as the bad guy. I thought he was very good. I did not care for his henchmen as they didn't seem to bring anything to the table. Likewise John Cena is not an actor. He doesn't need to be in an action movie if the plot is compelling but it's really not. There aren't any memorable action scenes that stick out in my mind as I reflect back so all I am recalling is the awkward delivery that John Cena had. I also didn't care for his character's wife; who was very attractive but had a quality about her that said there was nothing going on upstairs. The pair is not a couple who are developed characters; the wife especially comes off as an arrogant shrew and so as a viewer I'm not invested in the film when she is kidnapped.All in all this movie would have been a better film as a focus on Robert Patrick's jewelery store heist and escape. That was much more interesting than The Marine and his walk through a swamp. But that's just my opinion.sincerelyR.C. ",3.0
" The storyline is good but developing the characters of the 'bad guys' was quite pathetic. No depth no brains just blow up things at random and find things to bicker and whine about... Especially trying to bring racism into the fray... lets blame the senseless violence on the 'black guy'. The character happened to be a black guy and had a penchant for self-destruction... and blowing everything else up as well. I personally found that little whining episode offensive no matter how you chose to interpret it.The character development of John Triton was pretty good but established him as more of a loose cannon rather than a highly skilled combat individual. This is further reinforced when he gets into fights and essentially uses his face to block many of the punches. That may work in the WWE but does not establish a character who is supposed to be highly skilled in hand/hand combat.Some of the scenes in the movie seemed to be filler to get minutes. Especially his encounter with the two poachers while running through the swamp.However the movie still managed to be fun to watch once I was able to adjust my expectations for the movie to be WWE entertainment and not as a full action movie.Overall you can enjoy this movie if you choose to it isn't a total loss but neither is it a winner.

" What a surprise. This film contains outstanding dialog. It's pretty funny. It does get boring later in the film perhaps there's a lack of content or grounding and the outstanding dialog seems to become average. The film makers seem to understand our boredom and presto change-o many car crashes and explosions. Their trickery seems to work.I will say this film does nothing for race relations. Especially if you take the film makers seriously. The black villain in the story is such a stereo-type of the bad guy obsessed with getting in touch with his blackness. Arch-type - that's what he is. Not a stereotype but a stand in for all African Americans or rather the personification of a certain ideology. Perhaps just a reality. This may be done intentionally that's my opinion. He's not shown to be a reliable character in the film. Just be a person not a Black man. Perhaps just avoid black men if possible. . . ? Building understanding. . . perhaps - but this film does nothing to improve race relations. Who said the Marines are about better race relations? At least we'd like to imagine they aren't. ",3.0

" Some might say that professional wrestlers are already actors to some extent. WWE Studios is dedicated to expanding the careers of those with acting talent from the ring to the big screen. As a champion John Cena brought an imposing physical presence rugged good looks and a certain flair for the dramatic to his wrestling and music endeavors. The Marine (2006) is a vehicle designed to showcase Cena's talents and he acquits himself well enough in his big screen debut an explosive and exciting but still rather unremarkable action thriller.Cena is ex-Marine John Triton discharged from the service for disobeying orders while on a mission in Iraq. Returning stateside Triton finds civilian life a little rough and decides to get away from it all for a while heading into the South Carolina mountains with his wife Kate (Kelly Carlson Nip/Tuck).At a roadside gas station a gang of thieves on the run ambush a couple of highway patrolmen. With their vehicle damaged the criminals led by Rome (Robert Patrick) and his lieutenant Angela (Abigail Bianca) slug John kidnap Kate and hit the road in Triton's SUV. Triton gives chase in the patrol car in what is the action highlight of the first half of the film. The gang is left travelling on foot through the swamp with Triton on their trail. The group make their way to a safe house. Triton arrives and takes out some of the gang but Rome sets off and explosion and makes his escape. Triton again has to dodge a fireball and after borrowing a police speedboat finally catches up to Rome. Up until the finish Cena's fight scenes are fairly routine but the battle between Cena and Patrick finally generates a few sparks.Although the story is rather simplistic and uncomplicated The Marine does entertain and provides the requisite opportunities for John Cena to flex his muscles and exercise his fledgling acting skills. Robert Patrick (The Unit Terminator 2) is a known talent and brings some humor and class to the production and he has enough physical stature to take on Cena. Kelly Carlson (who should be in more films) and Australian Abigail Bianca mix it up in a couple of spirited fights.Working with director Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger Die Hard 2) the acting potential that is shown here is more fully realized in Cena's next film 12 Rounds (2009). Though he is still chasing after a girl Cena's character is more well rounded and the film features more of Cena doing his thing behind the wheel of a vehicle. ",3.0

" The Marine is about a marine (John Cena) who is kicked out due to not following orders well. He then gets fired from his security job after man handling a jerk. He then stresses to his friend that 'being a marine is what he did best'. Then on a trip with his wife she's taken hostage by jewel thieves. They carry big guns and blow stuff up but while acting like the kind of baffoons you'd see in a Home Alone movie. Robert Patrick is cool as the leader of the bad guys but he gets so many goofy lines that it's hard to take him seriously. I think he's a wasted actor. I mean his performance in Walk the Line and other serious roles show that. Plus no he did not kill the X-Files like many fans say. The show trying to continue without Mulder killed the X-Files. He was pretty good in it.Anyway this movie doesn't know if it's an action thriller or action comedy. Plus I don't know why people praise the stunts. It's like wannabe Transporter or Transporter 2 type action. Plus with so many huge explosions you'd think that at least one person would die in them. But John Cena escapes every huge explosion without a mark on him.We also have seen how many movies where the heroe takes one bad guy at a time as one after another goes looking for him one after another. It worked a lot better for Die Hrad than it does for this film though. Now the good about the movie. It offers sexy women and although I'm not the biggest John Cena fan I can't say he's a bad action star. He has the right look even if he does basically give a one note performance. He's a marine and he makes sure we think of him as nothing but a marine. The script also makes sure we just think of him as nothing but a dangerous marine that loves his wife too. Since that's all we ever learn about him. It's just a fast paced brainless action film so it doesn't need any character build-up. ",3.0

" This film promised lots of action. It delivered. The numerous explosions made a great spectacle. Commercial director John Bonito helmed his first feature. He keeps the pacing going well. I had no clue who John Cena was and wondered how he grabbed an action lead. After seeing the DVD extras of his wrestling career I understand how he was cast and remembered him from channel surfing. His reactions are fairly wooden without many levels that we'd expect from a more experienced actor. But he gets an 'A' for effort and completed many of his own stunts.Robert Patrick who was the bad guy in 'Terminator 2",3.0
" In the Marine John Cena plays a discharged marine who tracks down the jewel thieves that kidnapped his wife. It draws inevitable comparisons to Commando Die Hard and countless other action flics - and it doesn't shy away from that. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously and throws in knowing references to other 'blow-em up' films [including a Terminator line for the sake of lead baddie Robert Patrick]. There's nothing new or really eye popping to see here. It is a formula driven testerone fest that does all the usual things that movies like this are supposed to do and it is all pulled off fairly well. Don't go into it expecting Bourne-like intrigue; however don't be surprised if you find yourself thinking how much John Cena looks like Bourne actor Matt Damon from the neck up. If there were a Bourne spoof Cena would be a no-brainer to play the title character. ",3.0

" This is rather fun to watch although it is completely over the top in being unrealistic.Although most action shows tend to be extreme in the situations that the star survives and thrives in this one puts virtually all others to shame in that regard. That is unfortunate as it is a storyline that could have proven to be a great movie if it were written better.It features John Triton (John Cena) as a former Marine who was kicked out of the Corps for disobeying an order. Of course had he obeyed the order many American lives would have been lost. Nevertheless he was scapegoated and discharged.One day he and his wife Kate (Kelly Carlson) are at a convenience store when a group of thugs kills a cop. They then take Kate hostage which proves to be a very poor decision for them as John is a commando the makes Rambo look like a wimp in comparison. The bad guys are about to have a very bad day indeed.This really could have been a great show but there are way too many extreme fires/explosions that get Triton. If the writers would have toned that part down just a bit this might have been a four or even a five star show. Hardcore actions fans will probably enjoy it but it comes off as a bit too hokey for many others. ",3.0
" John Cena was very realisitic made the part genuine and intriguing. He really portrayed a man going out of his mind with anger at his wife being kidnapped. At the same time he was clever and covert. It is unfortunate that with his talent and great looks he was given a substandard plot. He has untapped skills and a charisma that could make him a tremendous movie star in a story that is unique and capitalizes on his expertise. ",3.0
" The special effects were great and the production is pretty darn good. By the end of the movie you realize the hero should've died a long time ago but then again that's what action movies are all about. Near the end he takes a sledgehammer to the gut which would've pretty much put most people out of commission. He's nearly blown up 3 times lives through a car chase where the car ends up being swiss cheese torn to pieces. The acting wasn't too bad but they tried to put humor in that I think only a WWE fan would appreciate. There was one funny moment I liked that referenced Terminator. It's a decent action movie if you just put logic aside and enjoy the ride. I'm not a wrestling fan so most of actors were unknown to me. It's worth a rent just for the car chase. ",3.0
" I was a little disappointed in this book. I had expected something original and different. It seemed to be a summary of books I had already read.

" Having suffered the derision of fellow sci-fi fans for many years I recently picked up the Foundation Trilogy for the first time; I was actually pretty disappointed by my first exposure to Asimov's longer works. Obviously the man is one of the renowned masters of science fiction because he got there first",3.0
" Foundation came to me highly recommended. I am not new to science fiction but I have not read that much of this genre. I was looking forward to something that would really blow my mind away. though I admired several things about the book and thought it was a nice read I am not going to read the other books in this series. Coming away from this book I felt it was good but not much more. There were several ways in which I clearly found the book to be lacking. Though Asimov's style is surely concise and highly readable he views plot as the central element to his writing at the expense of other aspects of great fiction that really should have been incorporated. I will outline these at length because it appears that the book's praises are already sung widely.First there is not much character development. Characters are presented merely to accomplish a historical event in the flow of the story. We get a feel for the characters not as real people but as actors on the stage of world history. Though the reader admires the nerve and intellect behind each of these heroes there is little else that makes them interesting. While this kind of presentation of characters may work in movie adaptations or history textbooks I like to view my characters as a little more than men at work. Everybody is always scheming there's not much downtime or description of what day-to-day life is like with these guys so far in the future such far-off planets.Secondly there is a lack of real meaning or symbolism that defines great books. The closest we get to intrinsic meaning is the description of the false religion that Salvor Hardin invents. And this only helps us understand what the author probably thinks about organized religion. The all-importance of nuclear energy also seems like propaganda to get ther reader to 'understand' how important it will be in our era with no attention paid to other kinds of fascinating technology that may exist in the future such as super-intellect robotics biotechnology etc. I don't know if Asimov was just lacking in creativity because with the exception of his brilliant description of the mother planet Trantor the only thing different between this far off future and nowadays is the ability to jump through space.Thirdly romance does not play a role in the book. There no women in the book which means there can be no romantic intrigue or world events influenced by a woman. Also there is no sense of wonder and excitement that a reader surely hopes to get when they enter an author's imagination. The landscape of these far off worlds is sparesely and hardly described. We spend much of our time in staterooms.On the other hand if you like books that are centered on brilliant leaders of nation-states and how their decisions affect the course of history you will like this book. If you are fascinated by the economic political and sociological macroforces that shape history you will like this book. If you're more about the game than the players you will like this book. ",3.0
" The main reason I read sci-fi is to visualize strange new worlds and places. Although a good book I didn't really get a good mental picture of the different worlds involved in it except Trantor in the very beginning of the book. It was mostly about people and politics with very little of the landscapes they lived in. I guess that is why I liked the Dune and Hyperion series so much. ",3.0
" Being a science fiction fan for some years I picked up a copy of Foundation after hearing wonderful things about this series and loving I Robot. On the whole I think I Robot is a better read largely because I got to know and empathize with the characters in that set of stories more which is my main criticism of this book.Nevertheless Foundation is still very worthwhile and while I wouldn't recommend this book to everyone there are certain friends who I think would love it - it's for a select audience who loves science fiction and/or Isaac Asimov. I am going to continue on with the series - and we'll see how it goes! ",3.0
" The key to enjoying the original Foundation trilogy is to understand that the three novels which make up the 'trilogy' are not really novels. They are a series of interconnected stories written over time. Foundation is actually 5 short stories. Because of this the stories vary in quality.The second book Foundation and Empire is actually two stories. The first is called The General and tells the story of the empire's last ditch effort to conquer the foundation. The weakness of the first story is that all the action takes place off page. We never see any of the actual combat we just read the characters talking about it. Also the resolution comes way too quickly. It feels like Asimov had reached his page limit and decided to end the story as quickly as he could.The second story called The Mule is the real draw here. All the previous stories presented a challege for the foundation to overcome. However it was always expected that the foundation would triumph based on the long term scientific predictions of its founder. The Mule throws in a variable that was not predicted. The appearance of a mutant who swiftly moves to conquer the various planets left in the wake of the old empire's collapse. Ultimately he sets his sights on the foundation. The best part of the story is a visit to the ruins of the planet Trantor. Former capital of the galactic empire.Having finished this second book I have come to realize that the Foundation trilogy while entertaining is certainly not Asimov's best work. Time is not always kind to science fiction and all of these early stories were written before 1950 when Asimov was still a young writer. I plan to continue on to the next book but I no longer expect to be overwhelmed by the classic status these stories have achieved. ",3.0
" I like Foundation because it's a solid piece of sci-fi from olden days. (George Lucas's stealing of Asimov's city-planet for his Coruscant - tsk tsk Georgie - amazed me most.) Foundation does have peculiarities. People hundreds of thousands of years in the future speak like us. They use phrases like us. They also have the same atomic technology as people did in the 1950s. Asimov got a bit lazy here; he could've imagined something cooler than nukes. The galaxy is a metaphor for a crumbling Roman empire. Perhaps Terminus is Ireland. As for A's style I found his use of long adverbs rather funny. In sum a good book if you can ignore this stuff. ",3.0
" I know I'll take some major heat in saying this but I wasn't that impressed with this beloved classic. Oh the idea intrigues me surely that of humankind eons in the future existing across the galaxy on a multitude of worlds so far removed from earth that eminent masters of science themselves debate whether earth was even the planet where human life began but once the dust settled from an idea that lofty what did Asimov really DO with it? He used it for unexciting little tales of science v. military might. I love the parallel between the fall of this vast space empire and the fall of Rome. The way bands of scientists struggled in a dark age to keep the light of knowledge alive was thought-provoking (which is high praise in my lexicon) but this was backdrop and the plot Asimov employed in telling the story of all this was (sorry to say) dull slow simple and unworthy of the imaginative concepts he thought up in his setting for this tale of knowledge overcoming strength of arms. I haven't read the later Foundation novels so maybe they're the ones where the brilliance of the series exists but I found this book from Sci-Fi's golden age so demanding on my patience that I didn't finish it the first time I tried to read it and barely made it to the end the second time. I wish I shared the glowing praise for this classic that millions of others claim they feel but to be honest I just don't. ",3.0
" Re-reading Foundation showed it to be rather dated in its depiction of an advanced galactic empire rooted in its 1940s science fiction environment. The overall plot such as it is betrays the novel's origins as separate short stories and the characters tend to be wooden. Foundation and Empire the next book in Asimov's original Foundation trilogy is a much better novel especially in its depiction of the character of the Mule. However the concept of psychohistory introduced in this work is fascinating and the key to the other books by Asimov and others describing past and future developments in the Foundation universe.

" The second of the first Foundation trilogy Foundation and Empire was originally published in 1952. Originally published as two novellas in Astounding Science Fiction 'The General' and 'The Mule' cover the next two periods when the Foundation receives its first full-force attacks.In 'The General' the Galactic Empire is well on its way to its inevitable end but under the command of General Bel Riose an attack is planned against the Foundation. Bel Riose has gone mad with power and will stop at nothing to obliterate the Foundation somehow believing they are behind the fall of the empire. He amounts huge forces if armored gunships with plans wipe the Foundation from the galaxy. But one man from the Foundation knows about this and he also knows knowledge is power and since the Foundation is soon as that which has all the knowledge he knows Bel Riose can be stopped so long as he gets to the Emperor before the general attacks.In 'The Mule' the Galactic Empire has fallen into a selection of barbaric kingdoms while the Foundation has become strong and powerful but also full of corruption composed of approximately thirty outer planets. But there is corruption within the ranks and things are stirring within the Foundation's empire. Meanwhile there is a new leader who has rise an enigmatic mutant known as 'The Mule' who has only known scorn and suffering and is a hardened creature who respects no one but he also has the ability to read and control people's emotions. It is up to two Foundation citizens Toran and Bayta Darell along with the Foundation's only psychologist Ebling Mis and a strange refugee clown 'Magnifico Giganticus' to search for the Second Foundation set up by Hari Seldon originally when the Foundation was created and stop this 'Mule.'Originally written on February 5 2011 Alex C.

" Isaac Asimov was one of the greatest science fiction minds of the twentieth century. He was NOT however a great writer. At times it is difficult to separate the brilliance and scope of his imaginative ideas from the pedestrian and awkward manner in which he presents them.'Foundation' the first novel in the ever-lengthening Foundation series is a collection of short stories originally published in 'Astounding' magazine. The first couple are very good but the last few are pretty uninteresting. The writing is uneven dialogue is unrealistic and characters are wooden and one-dimensional. And yet through Asimov's wonderfully creative idea of psychohistory and its use in saving a dying Galactic Empire this series became one of the best science fiction stories of all time and well worth reading.Do be careful which edition you read. I read the Del Ray paperback edition and I have never seen so many typographical errors in a published book. ",3.0

" Let's face it",3.0
" That's not saying much since I thought that 'Foundation' was pretty poor.'Foundation and Empire' was pretty good but still lacked in certainareas - mainly character development and also the first third of thebook had a very weak story line. The whole battle with the Empire bythe Foundation was very very weak I cannot stress that enough. Maybe Iwas just hoping for an epic battle between the renegade Foundation andthe dying Empire. Nothing really happened to spur the victory of theFoundation there wasn't even really a battle. But I guess that mightbe the point that Asimov was making since Seldon predicted the choicesand decisions of the Emperor about the passion that the characters hadfor the battle. It wasn't even a battle between the Empire it was somemission designed and orchestrated by some general in the navy thatthought it would be a good idea to take over the Foundation.This book also lacked in strong characterizations but not as much asthe first 'Foundation' by a long shot. The last two thirds of the bookstick with the same characters the whole time. It also enters apowerful mutant the Mule. I won't give much away about the Mule andhis plans because I don't want to spoil the book but it sets up for thesequel 'Second Foundation.' Once again the idea of the Mule is a goodidea but is somewhat poorly executed until the ened when everything isexplained about the effects the Mule has on the Foundation and thepeople in the main storyline.Get ready for 'Second Foundation' because it will probably be the bestof the first trilogy. This book is worth reading and if 'SecondFoundation' is better than this book then I will recommend the'Foundation Series' to anybody who can persist in their reading anddoesn't mind a long slow beginning.

" How can this be considered a classic? It's fun it's entertaining but it lacks so much qualities all classics have!The Mule was a disappointment. I knew from the beggining who he was. I found myself skimming sections of this novel because I got bored with it. When I got to page 50 I was ready to give up on the novel and put it down but I thought this book has to be good it's consider a classsic! So I decided to read the whole novel. A classic novel is suppose to convey a message to the reader about life the words and writing style is suppose to be superior to the average writer and the story should stand out as one of the more creative stories.

" After reading Prelude (which I thoroughly enjoyed) I began FOUNDATION with much anticipation. Unfortunately the book did not meet my expectations. First it was really boring and predictable. Second you never stay with a scenario long enough for any character development. As soon as the reader gets to know one of the characters Asimov rushes ahead 50 years and a new cast of characters enters. My final complaint about FOUNDATION is that most of the characters are presented as simple minded. I might read the rest of the books in this series only because I have been told they get better.

" While I believe that Asimov was a great science fiction author I was disappointed in this book and the whole series. To me science fiction is about new ideas of the future and an exciting story. While the idea of a falling society where some foresee the downfall of its society and plan to minimise the impact is interesting it could have been staged as well in the past. One can tell that the book has been written some while ago and it is missing the action and technologies I want to read about in a science fiction book today. For me personally the book is also very slow paced and not engaging enough to make me want to continue reading it but rather read some chapters at a time and then I can put it down for weeks since I am not engaged enough to read further. Still I am kind of interested in how the series continues and finally ends but not interested enough that I have to use every free minute reading it. I find it hard to judge this book and if you are into science fiction I believe you just have to give it a try. Yes I rated it only three stars but rating this book in a one dimensional fashion doesn't do its justice since I believe it is still a very good book but just not what I was expecting of a science fiction and wanted to read.

" I was expecting so much more from this book as it was once awarded best sci-fi series ever. It was good but not that great. Maybe in the 1950's it was the best of sci-fi but compared to today's standards it was a little boring and out of date. It contains long dialogs and a lot of politics wrapped in a sci-fi environment. It doesn't contain fascinating worlds and interesting glimpses of the future. There's not a lot of action but I have to admit the dialog is pretty good.

" From everything I've heard about this book I was really excited to read it. After reading the first half in a few days then forcing myself to finish the second half after taking a two week break I can honestly say that I found it to be a real let down.The main theme was about the only part I liked. Humanity has colonized the stars and controls everything blah blah blah but a really smart guy and his friends do some math equations and figure out that the currently all-powerful and all-encompassing Empire is doomed to collapse and thrust mankind thousands of years back to a 'barbaric' state. His solution is to gather all the great minds of the day and create an educated stronghold on the edge of the galaxy to serve as a becon of hope and enlightnenment to supposedly shorten the time mankind has to spend in the dark ages.Their main goal is to create an encyclopedia that pretty much contains every biit of information ever learned. Ever. (wikipedia)Well it turns turns out that several years after the creation of Foundation the shallow characters are riddeled with 'crises'. Good thing the late creator appears via prerecorded videos at strategic times to offer advice to the indistinguishable residents and assures them that he did some math problems fifty years ago and discovered that everyting with work itself out. This is the basis for the rest of the book.The characters are dull boring and super confident in everything they do because some dead guys math and future predictions will save them all.The second half of the book proved to be slightly more interesting but not much ",3.0
" The first thing to understand about Foundation is that it isn't really a novel. It is a collection of 5 connected short stories (The Psychohistorians The Encyclopedists The Mayors The Traders & The Merchant Princes) written in the 1940s for publication in Astounding Science Fiction Magazine. The first story in the book was actually written a few years later for repackaging the stories as the first novel in what would eventually become the Foundation trilogy (later expanded with additional books).The galactic empire is rotting. After it collapses there will follow 30000 years of barbarism. Nothing can prevent the collapse but Hari Seldon believes that the subsequent dark ages can be contained to 1000 years if the proper steps are taken. To achieve this he sets up the Foundation at the very fringes of the empire. The first two stories are far and away the best in the book and are worth the price of admission by themselves. This is because they deal directly with the central premise which is a fantastic idea.Things go downhill with the next two stories. In particular The Traders seems completely unnecessary. Things pick up a bit with the final chapter.Taken as a whole Foundation is less than the sum of its parts. I don't think it is the unrivaled masterpiece that many make it out to be. I would definitely go in with an open mind and lowered expectations.However as I mentioned earlier the idea is fantastic and promises much more and better to come. I will definitely be checking out the next book in the series. ",3.0

" I recently re-read this classic work of science fiction and was pleasantly surprised to find it's still relevant today. The characters and language are a bit creaky but the social issues Asimov raises are sound. Under what conditions is it ethical for a self-appointed academic elite to hoodwink and trick the general population for their own good? Phrased that way the answer seems obvious -- under no conditions at all? -- but what if it really IS for their own good and if disaster is the alternative?We don't have any better answers to those questions today than we did 70 years ago when Asimov was writing.

" When a book is slated as one of the greatest Sci-Fi novels of our time it should be extremely hard to criticize. Unfortunately I found The Foundation to have more than a few flaws which actually made it a chore to read. Considering that it beat out 'The Lord of the Rings' for the Hugo Award in 1965 for best All-Time Series which is why I decided read it makes it even more insufferable in my opinion. Simply look at how momentous LOTR's has become over The Foundation in our culture and you can begin to see how it is obviously lacking something. So why does it fall short ? Well the primary reason is the story line jumps vast amounts of time chapter to chapter which even though I found refreshing it gives the reader a completely new set of characters in different settings which receive little to no development. So ultimately the visual depth as well as character depth which I find so alluring about Sci-Fi is ultimately lacking leaving little for the imagination to grasp on to. What this does do though is leave room for what I believe Asimov wanted the reader to really experience which is the psychohistorical themes built upon long term economic strategy which was wonderfully orchestrated and second to none. The thing that gets me is considering that is the focus of the story it could have just as easily taken place in the 1800's and 1900's and be based on oil or guns instead of nuclear power. Don't get me wrong the story is intriguing but if you are looking for a visually stimulating Sci-Fi book I would look elsewhere...or you can just wait for the feature film in 2013. ",3.0

" This may be a classic and I may be a science fiction fan but read Asimov's 'The Gods Themselves' instead of this. His later work is definitely better. 'Foundation and Empire' is like its predecessor ('Foundation') in that you get several stories told in different periods throughout Foundation history. Everything Asimov has come up with in these books is fundamentally good sci-fi story stuff but the lack of character development makes you think while you're reading 'Why am I reading this?' I'll read the last in the trilogy ('Second Foundation') but that's as far as I'm going to go with these.For great sci-fi read 'Hyperion' 'Fall of Hyperion' 'Ender's Game' 'Childhood's End' '2001",3.0

So I bought 'Foundation' along with the other two novels in the original trilogy and away I went.Very boring. Very dry. Very forgettable. The problem here I think is that while Asimov had some very fantastic ideas floating around in that pioneering noggin of his he was not exactly the best at nurturing them into full-form on the page. Thus we have a series of novels that read much more like outlines of a stronger and more fleshed-out epic. The setting is grand the characters are intriguing. The plot is one for the ages. The final product however does little justice to these ideas and I found that to be vastly disappointing. All throughout I wanted more. I wanted more world-building - not necessarily technobabble and meandering Dickenson discription but at least more insight into the nature of this vast civilization apparently on the brink of collapse. Very much the same with the characters - I wanted to sympathize with Hari Seldon as he worked to keep knowledge alive in the face of ignorance but it was so hard to do so when he was presented as little more than a piece of animated cardboard. I was thinking constantly about what could have been and that put a damper on the overall effect.I think the ideas and character tropes Asimov put forth in his trilogy have been worked with by other authors and brought to life far more successfully in the years since its initial release. Novels that come to mind are Dan Simmons's awe-inspiring 'Hyperion' series and Neal Stephenson's bulky 'Anathem'. In these books great ideas are coupled with great writing. The results as much as it hurts me to say it put Asimov's original to shame.'Foundation' is a great series to read if you want to witness science fiction as it was in its infantile and supposedly-golden age. But I think that it#s nevertheless important to understand that pioneering ideas can further develop and be presented in far-superior ways as the years progress. Such is the case here. Imaginative but slow and dated. Should most certainly remain in print and continue to be read but I do not think it is the gold-standard classic it has been made out to be. Others have done much better. ",3.0
" I used to be a big fan. Somehow the first season wasn't what I remembered. Still John Ritter saved it all. I still am buying season 2. ",3.0
" I was reluctant to buy this disc because of its high price/few episodes ratio. (Come on 'All in the Family' gets 26 episodes for $30 that's under $1 per episode and that's how it should be for all TV!) However as a proceed of the purchase (how much they won't tell us hmmmm...) goes to a charity John Ritter adored I broke down tonight and bought it.After the ubiquitous FBI screen disappears I was greeted with a menu. Ignore the naysayers there is nothing wrong with how this menu works and I've used far far worse in my 300 movie collection. I rather like the menu... And the fact they have a menu option telling us of the Spring 2004 release for season 2 made my day it's nice to see they'll put out this series for the fans.Now for the transfer. Audio quality is superb well restored. Video quality is a different story. Upon freeze-framing it's very clear that despite doing a good job at restoring the master tapes they did a rather poor transfering the video to DVD. (You HDTV fans out there may not like watching this on your sets... and by 1996 the FCC is pulling the plug on current broadcast standards...) I can think of 2 reasons why the video looks as poor as it does but it suffices to say that the end result is a video image that looks needlessly grainy; broadcast video technology of the time never ever looked this bad. But while not as bad as VHS consumer quality videotape it is well below acceptable DVD quality. (for another example of what not to do in terms of transfrring video quality onto DVD check out the dithering used in 'The Best of the Chris Rock Show' - yuck!) But given the price of this disc and that 'All in the Family' costs less per episode and yet looks far better (despite NOT having had its master tapes restored) I'm knocking 2 points off. DVD video should not ever look this grainy in a freeze-frame. (it is bearable when things in motion but be prepared for a shock if you're a 'quality freak'.)6 episodes. I was pondering the same issue why not have a season 1 + 2 box set? But then we'd have to wait until spring and I hate waiting though I would have if the video looked better. Besides these episodes are HILARIOUS. The gags the double entendres the Ropers... it's all there. And when you are laughing so much you start to cry and get a stomachache you know you're watching a winner of a show that's well written and well cast. No wonder 'Three's Company' became a success so quickly. As other reviewers here and other websites post plot synopses and reviews I won't here. (well 'No Dogs No Children' was probably my favorite of the bunch especially the scene where Chrissy and Jack are in the kitchen feeding the puppy...)And the real downfall is John Ritter died an untimely death. ",3.0
" Three's Company is about as overrated as a TV show can get. First of all every single episode is about the same. How many episodes can be written on a simple misunderstanding? John Ritter was talented but this show caused him to be castwritten for the rest of his life. The guy acted gay just a little 'too' well if you ask me. The best you can say about this show is that Suzanne Somers used to jump around and jiggle without a bra.Don't be fooled by the cover. Joyce DeWitt did not look this hot until much later in the show. For now she still has the dippy-doo haircut and has the sex appeal of a cactus. The producers of the show didn't make her sexy until Suzanne left.'Larry' the used car salesman upstairs may have played a ladie's man but he was just plain scary like a werewolf. When was that hairstyle ever popular? His eyebrows seemed to reach out and grab people. The guy was as hairy as a rug too. Just looking at his arms you couldn't tell what race he was.Well John died recently while making a show with the sexiest woman on television Katey Sagal. People are saying this DVD release is a tribute to John. Poo poo I say. If Three's Company needed a much needed tribute it was to the great Norman Fell aka Mr. Roper. He was funnier than four John Ritters. I mean c'mon he had lines like 'Hey it's easy to find my wife on a nude beach she's the one that looks like her socks are rolled down!' Now that is humor my friends. So if you must buy this DVD buy it for an overlooked comedian the late great Norman Fell. ",3.0
" I expected so much from Townsend after reading a few of his other stories. However there is less bdsm content than I expected and more political/social commentary. Not a bad thing if one is more aware of the politics and social environment of the gay community in the 1970s but hard to follow and identify with otherwise. I had difficulty empathizing with any of the characters -- perhaps part of that lies with the fact that there are so many characters in the story. However there are several hot scenes in the book and therefore it may be worth the time and money to purchase the book. ",3.0

" I found this to be one of the better books I've seen about setting up shop. It showcases plenty of example shops and has some handy advise. However like most books on this topic it tries to cover all the possibilites - building a separate shop working in a shed basement attic etc. and pertinent information for any one case is thus sparse. I'd like to see books specifically for conversion of a basement space or shed etc. into a shop but I guess that would only add limitations on readership from a writer/publisher perspective. ",3.0

How do they arrange their workbenches in relation to their tool boxes how do they store their clamps how do they store their wood etc.Overall I think Taunton Press's 'The Workshop Book' is a better resource for these kinds of ideas. This book is nice but The Workshop Book goes into much more detail. ",3.0
" Who wouldn't watch a movie that had Mel Gibson wearing obscenely tight leather trousers and looking scarily young?Before The Passion was brought to the attention of film buffs and the press there was Lethal Weapon. And before that Mel Gibson made his name in the Mad Max movies.There's nothing on the DVD I got for my birthday not even a trailer. And I hate watching DVDs with no trailers. I'm fussy me. So I wasn't sure what to expect or what the film was exactly about. All I knew was that my mum couldn't wait to watch it and was drooling (along with me) when Mel Gibson appeared shirtless.Before the amount of money that was spent in the car chase along a freeway in Matrix Reloaded there was this. A simple but still effective car chase which introduces you very briefly to Max. I don't see the point in spending loads of money when all you need is a bunch of cars that can be trashed and a camera.Then you get to see that Max has a pretty young wife and a young child. You can almost see how the rest of the movie pans out after that. It's pretty obvious he's not mad until something really traumatic happens. I was expecting the whole growling throwing stuff but instead he seemed relatively calm - except for the sweat on his face.It's NOT obvious that this movie could get another two sequels out of it. Maybe one sequel but two? And the latter featuring Tina Turner of all people. And there's rumoured to be a fourth along with a fourth Die Hard and god knows what else. Something tells me Mel Gibson won't fit into those trousers!If you think this is going to be a movie based on revenge you're wrong. The revenge part doesn't start until about half an hour before the end.It will be interesting to see the sequels. To be honest this film did nothing for me - unless you count the tight trousers! Very easy on the eyes if you know what I mean. ",3.0
" This is an excellent example of Mel Gibson's fine acting work. If you haven't seen it but have seen Beyond Thunderdome give it a viewing. Unfortunatly I purchased the DVD version which was released in 1998. It doesn't have any special features at all. You are also stuck with the American voices dubbed over the Austrailian actor's. This can be quite funny in itself but I wish I had the option to see both the original Aussie tape and the Americanized version on one disk. ",3.0
" So let me set the record straight about this version of the movie from Amazon's Instant Video. It is the original Aussie soundtrack not an English dubbed version. Between all the different DVDs and downloads if you are interested in downloading this one be assured that it is not dubbed. It is however pan and scan.

" I'm really not sure why but this is my least favorite in the Mad Max trilogy. It's not nearly as awesome as the Road Warrior or fun as Beyond Thunderdome. Either way it's worth watching simply because it sets the scene for Road Warrior one of the greatest movies of all time. ",3.0
" In 1981 THE ROAD WARRIOR was released in to the United States and became an instant hit but George Miller's story of angry cop Max begins with his 1979 classic MAD MAX.Mel Gibson plays the title character 'Mad' Max Rockatansky a cop in a postapocalyptic future (when exactly isn't specified). He's the best cop around patroling the highways for speed-hungry gang members. Well after his best friend is killed and Max steps in the gang gets a little mad. In the end Max (now gone a little beyond Mad) sets out to avenge the death of his wife and infant child both killed by the gang.MAD MAX is a sci-fi classic that spawned one of the best-loved sci-fi series of all-time. Miller's directing style brings the needed impact to the seemingly dead futuristic earth. Gibson is also good in his star-making role (look at how young he is...wow!) - plus Brian May (not the Queen Brian May) contributes a good score.Top-notch sci-fi action entertainment and one of the greatest (and funnest) films to come out of Australia. Followed by MAD MAX 2 (THE ROAD WARRIOR) and MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME. ",3.0
" In a post-apocalyptic Australia Max (Mel Gibson) and his fellow officers try to keep order on the highways as nihilistic biker gangs grow ever bolder. We are given the definite impression that the final bastions of civilization are on their last legs as chaos encroaches.This film presents intriguing characters and a suitably bleak scenario. It starts strong but it loses its energy before the end. Perhaps I was spoiled by seeing the classic action sequel 'The Road Warrior' first. When Max goes mad at the end of this first film director George Miller doesn't set the action sequences up very well or provide much of a payoff. The most exciting set pieces actually come much earlier in the movie. However his next film will prove that he can be a master of action. ",3.0
" This film is the prequel to the amazingly good 'The Road Warrior'. I've read that 'Mad Max' has the highest return on investment of any film ever made ($100K to make $100M in revenue generated); however upon watching this movie you will immediately be struck by its very low budget look and feel. If you've already watched 'The Road Warrior' you may want to watch this one to see where RW has its roots but you really need to watch RW first. Leonard Maltin (in his RW review) states that Mad Max is at least as good as RW; he is crazy. MM is a great movie for having been made for $100K but RW is a GREAT MOVIE period. One more thing this film is dubbed with American voices because someone in their infinite wisdom thought Americans wouldn't be able to understand Australian accents. This was a big mistake as the American voice actors invariably overacted in their dubbing. ",3.0
" I don't recommend this edition. Ok the picture is good and the Australian language track is quite cool but the movie is cut.In the scene in which Max visits the burned Goose in hospital has been censored meaning Goose's burned body isn't shown. Ok maybe that's something not everybody wants to see but if I buy a special edition I expect to see the whole movie. ",3.0
" It's not altogether surprising that Mad Max got such short shrift when it came out Stateside with an unfortunate dubbing job to eliminate the `Strine accents so American International could pretend it was an American film (Mel Gibson suffered perhaps a worse indignity with his screen credit moved to last position just before the lab credit on the trailers). Much of what people remember and love about Max is delivered in the sequel rather than this first outing. Indeed at times it feels more like a blueprint than a proper movie and Gibson barely registers in the surprisingly little screen time he has - the villains who all seem to be doing either premature Danny Huston impersonations or somewhat more timely German New Romantic turns make much more of an impression. Not only do huge sections of the film keep him offscreen but he makes little impact in his underwritten role when he is on. In many ways this is just a first low-budget draft of Max's world - civilization hasn't entirely crumbled yet and the precious juice is still flowing even if parts are getting hard to find. Still the car stunts are good if somewhat thin on the ground but this is one case where the sequels are definitely better.MGM/UA's special edition offers reasonable extras but they are limited by the non-involvement of George Miller and Mel Gibson and the unavailability of any archive footage. The making of featurette and audio commentary from crew members are the best of the bunch while the Gibson featurette tends to be too much of a puff piece. Despite being listed as the Australian trailer the theatrical trailer and the accompanying TV spots are all from the US release. Thankfully the original Australian soundtrack to the feature is included on this disc. ",3.0

" 'Mad Max' is one of those films that is on everyone's top film lists. Not only did it introduce us to Australian cinema but also a young 21-year old newbie named Mel Gibson. 'Mad Max' was dark it was brooding it was destructive and it never gave us that glimmer of hope for humanity but now - nearly 20 years later - does it still remain the classic that it started? Sure it was impressive to watch the crash scenes it was powerful to see the world through Mr. Miller's disturbed eyes but is it re-watchable? Does it have the appeal to see new things throughout if watched and watched again? For me the answer seemed to float near 'no'. While I loved what 'Mad Max' represented what it was - a full body of color and action - it wasn't something to be watched again and again. Gibson does a great job as Max a man torn between the evils of the road and his personal philosophies. He begins as an ominous optimist able to stop crime as it occurs on the streets but then as his sense of normality is turned upside down his ability to react and adapt is seen. The final moments he has transformed from the man we were first introduced to into something quite terrifying. One could also compliment Mr. Miller's directorial outing at times it felt a bit episodic with tough edits placed but for the majority he told a deathly story with great ease and excitement. So again there is no arguing that 'Mad Max' is an important film one that I am glad to have finally seen but once was enough. It seems to be lacking that re-watch excitement.But why has that conclusion been made? What makes 'Mad Max' mediocre instead of powerful? It is hard to pinpoint the exact scene but the sense of 'alright I've seen it - now what' was definitely present by the end. Yet there were points that I just loved. Gibson was perfect. He was incredible as Max and the world that Mr. Miller created was intense. The opening scene the car crashes as our bearded villain just yelled 'Toecutter' was fantastic. 'Mad Max' has one of those openings that just pulls you in that makes you excited to watch a film of this intensity but then where do you go? Miller seemed to indicate that more car crashes more violence more cliche family drama would indicate a stronger film. At times he was right his ability to create different scenes set across the same backdrop demonstrated his originality but then there were times where it just felt recycled. One scene that stands out is where our gang of bikers track down a couple that happens to be at the wrong place at the wrong time they chase them down and demoralize them as Max and his partner find them - then almost repetitively it happens with Max and his girl later in the film. In this post-apocalyptic world there seems to be no problem finding someone. Space seems to not be a problem. This was another unexplained moment - where the coincidence of discovering Max or finding the biker gang should have been more difficult. These repetitive essentially simplistic scenes seemed to detract from the power of what Max represented. One also needs to ask about the story the unknown of what time or place we are following Max - would this have strengthened the story knowing what world we lived in? The understanding that this was a low-budget film was rooted in my mind the techniques provided were impressive but should that have been neglected for mediocre storytelling? Perhaps I misread this film perhaps I missed the joy of why this is hailed as such a cult success.Another weakness against 'Mad Max' has to be the relationship between his wife/girlfriend and child. Again the lacking story helped confuse this viewer as to what dynamic they had but when we have scenes in which the child is completely forgotten about - it just decimates the reasons behind Max's anger and utter breakdown. There were several scenes in which I yelled at the screen 'What about the child' then finally they would remember - he seemed to fade in and out of existence too often for one film. Then when disaster strikes we are forced to believe that suddenly Gibson would release his inner rage? It just didn't work. The same can be said for his wife/girlfriend. A stronger definition of character and even more lines spoken would have helped me see the relationship. She seemed angry at first the product of a failed marriage forced by this post-apocalyptic world to stay together then we were introduced to love then suddenly she moved to idiocrity. Who would believe that running down a road when there are open fields around is the better option? It was these small inconsistencies that forced 'Mad Max' from greatness to just another average action film. Two-plus hour sweeping epics aren't always needed but stronger characters do help in creating the world that we as viewers are to inhabit for 90-ish minutes.Finally applause are in order for the villain in this film. The portrayal of Toecutter by Hugh Keays-Byrne was outstanding. The small attention to detail as well as his ability to make you feel like he would do anything to get his way - similar to the portrayal of Joker in 'The Dark Knight' - was an up moment for this film. Like a roller coaster 'Mad Max' had these ups and downs curves and jerks and when it was all said and done you really had to question whether you were going to ride it again. 'Mad Max' is an important film there is no question in my mind about that. The door that this film opened for future cinema in America couldn't have been done by a better group of filmmakers but it isn't a promising classic. I could not watch this film again. The sequels I am ready for but this ride is over - and the park is closing. I realize that I am in the minority but 'Mad Max' is a low-budget film that uses repetitive filmmaking as its staple - originality is present but you must search to find it.Grade",3.0

" This is an interesting film which if occasionally a bit wooden virtually created its own genre overnight and made Mel Gibson a star.Perhaps its most noteable feature was George Miller's use of unusual camera angles which created one or two iconic images.

" I find this type of history to be dubious. The author looks at one province and then generalizes his findings over the entire South Vietnamese nation. If one were to look at the attitudes of American colonists during the Revolutionary war by region one would find great disparities of opinion and support for the independence cause. Some areas of the colonies were strongly loyalist. Did this make the independence movement less valid? Another example; take two cities in Texas Austin and Fort Worth. Survey the populations of these areas about their opinions of President Bush. You would find greatly divergent aggregate views. My point is that this type of regional analysis is of limited use if you are trying to generalize over a population larger than the one investigated.It was no different in Vietnam. There were areas where the locals strongly supported the insurgency such as in the Iron Triangle which included Hau Nghia I believe. It is no surprise that the author found support for the insurgency here. On the other hand there were many places were the population strongly opposed the insurgency and even fled their arrival. Finally let us not forget that during the Tet offensive there was no general uprising against the South Vietnamese government as the communists fully expected there would be. Quite to the contrary in fact. The ARVN fought valiantly and the general population tried to stay out of the way and let the military restore order. Much as the general population does in all conflicts.This sort of parochial view of situations can have devastating effects on Policy just as it did with the over throw of Ngo Dinh Diem. The Saigon elites wanted Diem gone. But the Saigon elites had no more in common with the populace at large in Vietnam as Wall Street Financiers have with Iowa wheat farmers. Again the ideas of a small sampling were generalized over a large population and policy was formulated based on this. Another example of this concept can be found in one of the oft criticisms of Diem. Diem was often faulted for being a catholic in a predominantly Buddhist country. Calling Vietnam a Buddhist country is like calling the USA a Christian country. Probably most Americans call themselves Christian but what does this mean? It means many things and encompasses many ideas. Ideas that are often at odds with each other. The same was true in Vietnam at the time. This kind of historic generalization is of limited usefulness to understanding the larger context. The Author should have refrained from extending his conclusions to the larger whole based on an otherwise interesting investigation.As for those who served in Vietnam and had their opinions validated by this text. Again this is a question of generalizing over the whole one's own personal experiences. We all like to think of ourselves as representative of everyone else but this is not necessarily true either. I have the utmost respect for those who served in Vietnam. They did their duty during a difficult period in our history. However most American service personnel did not speak the language were isolated from the local population and only received a limited understanding of the situation in Vietnam. How can one truly fromulate a concrete understanding of something in such circumstances? Also is the perspective of the grunt humping the boonies going to be the same as a Saigon warrior? Clearly not. Many soldiers came away from Vietnam with opinions about the local population that were shaped by an extremely limited exposure to them in a myriad of different contexts. One does not have to look far however to find countless books by soldiers and civilians who worked closely with the Vietnamese and local populations and came to completely different conclusions. Most of the books written by those who understood the language or dealt with the Vietnamese regularly show a strong belief in the cause of aiding the Vietnamese. Those who got to truly know the Vietnamese most frequently came away with a very positive feeling toward them believed they were worthy of the efforts being expended by the USA and were sincere in their desire to be free of communist domination.It has been my intention here to point out the limitations of interpreting broad historical events by looking at microcosms in history. Having established this I do believe that this book is a worthwhile read. It is an interesting regional investigation of a complex environment. I would just admonish people to approach it with an appreciation of its limitations and seek other sources to contrast this book with for a broader understanding of the war in general. ",3.0

It is a great CD and her voice is sublime aided of course by sound technicians. All artists owe their sound engineers their careers though. She and Barry have fun on it--it's fresh and alive. Not so much with the 2006 Concert CD a recording of the concert tour replete with IL Divo a mostly unnecessary addition. They are wooden men with BIG BORING voices.From the beginning Babs sounds tired hoarse and raspy. I saw her in concert where she sometimes sounded even worse than this recording. The engineers cleaned it up as well as they could leaving more than a hint of breathiness and weariness. Fortunately only about half of the songs are weakly rendered; the other half really are terrific experiences. I have no idea what is going on with her voice that from song to song there could be such differences but if I were Streisand I would leave the belting behind. It wouldn't hurt for her to warm up before she comes onstage not as she is giving the concert. For any price a fan would expect the performer to be well prepared. When she sings a soft ballad she often soars and her magic is prominent. It's painful to watch her crumble under the memory of her once youthful voice (and it was only a few years ago that she sounded like a 25 year old songstress). Streisand knows how to play a song for all its worth but she sometimes tramples it to death. *Don't Rain in My Parade* is just not what it used to be. She hits high notes but without the characteristic force. And she can hold the notes or seem to when she takes little breaks before each song's finale. Her phrasing is impeccable when she is giving it all she has to give but too often she seems bored. This is not a bad CD just not as inspired as *The Concert.*It also has to be said that it seems apparent Streisand is not taking care of her God-given voice one she herself has said that she takes for granted (unimaginable!!).The chatter inbetween songs is dull and preachy and it was exactly the same in every city except for blabbering about the fattening food she ate all across the US (excluded from the CD thank the Lord). The fans are really the stars on this CD--they roar constantly as if they had been starving to see Streisand all their lives. It's an odd treat. The orchestra is incredible but live it drowns her out at times (as does IL Divo). This recording does not relfect that though.If you do not own *The Concert* CD buy it and skip this one. This CD is for avid adoration-is-blind Streisand fans only and those keeping track of Streisand's vocal history.. ",3.0
" Big fan here always have been. Saw her in 1994 and 2000 and loved her voice and her song selection. Saw her in 2006 and left disappointed. I am not going to address the voice - let's face it - anyone expecting to hear Streisand in her prime is going to be disappointed. I want to address her song selection. How BORING! Like Garland's Over The Rainbow attendees cannot expect her not to sing the BIG ONES - Evergreen The Way We Were People and Happy Days Are Here Again - those are a given. But what about the rest?? Except for a few treasures (Cockeyed Optimist Unusual Way) the rest is a snooze fest. We already have live versions of Come Rain Or Come Shine (Australian Tour bonus CD from Barnes & Noble) Starting Here Starting Now Down With Love Children Will Listen What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life Somewhere. Where are the songs we haven't heard live before?? Perhaps something from Guilty Pleasures or Guilty? Anything from Yentl besides A Piece of Sky? If I Loved You? Perhaps songs she hasn't sung before from Broadway? Another Winter In A Summer Town or Will You from Grey Gardens? ANYTHING that wasn't written during the Ice Age would've sent the crowd and listener crazy. This is just more of the same just not sung quite as well as in the past. ",3.0
" I saw Streisand in concert this past October at Madison Square Garden in NYC. I have been a Streisand fan for many years and was hugely excited to actually be able to hear and see her sing live. By that point the reviews of her tour were glowing and I was looking so forward this very rare experience. I have to admit when I saw the show I felt a mixture of emotion but the most prominent was the feeling of being underwhelmed. Her voice was raspy and croaky and felt heavy in it's attempts to soar. I think her phrasing and breathe control is outstanding but the hoarseness makes this vocal instrument now far from pure. I hoped that this was simply a one night thing - she was having an off-night so much singing perhaps had strained her voice .However this record goes to show that Streisand's once incredible range power and vocal gymnastics are now on their way out. Of course she sounds good for 65 but this record in my mind should have never been released. It's hard to listen and not be disapointed. It's time that she put aside her arrogance and worked on her voice - she needs singing lessons she needs to change her diet she needs to have the voice that people want to hear not the lazy take it as you find it version. Barbra - call Celine she will give you tips on preservation! ",3.0

" For those who attended the concerts and were waiting to have a CD copy to 'feel the sense of being at her concert again' the CD is disappointed.This kind of live album is supposed to bring back the concert as it was with the highs and the lows. Even though Barbra was still great at the concert you could feel how her voice range has changed with age. (I am a lifelong fan of her musical career but not a worshiper) This album was so edited that it looks more like a enhance-in-studio product with a lot of cuts (sometimes they even abruptly cut her words...) than a concert. The sense of listening to a concert album is lost.This could be more appropiately named 'Highlights from the 2006 Tour concerts' since the production team seems like have picked the best performance of each song among the 16 dates and glue them in together.The decision to add different 'bonus' tracks for different outlets shows some lack of respect to her fans.

" This cd set reveals a hoarse sounding Streisand that sings sincerely-but has finally lost that crystal siren of a voice.She sounds different as a mature live performerand I kept longing to hear that sonic instrument that has lost it's primal power.It is enjoyable and good-but not the songstress we once knew.I'm suprised that the diva didn't play with the sonics more in the studio-and that is refreshing.She has allowed her human frailty to be exposed.Yes she is a multi talented woman.

" Although Barbra is always great I have mixed feelings about this CD because Il Divo and Barbra just don't harmonize that well together. I love them both but not together.

But I still loved the CD and it's worth having. ",3.0
" It's like Miss Kittin didn't know what to do with her debut solo album so she did it all. As a result it's a distracting and ultimately uninspired release. There's a rap track (Requiem For A Hit) and a Frecnh lounge number (3eme Sexe) and a rockin' punk ditty (Meet Sue Be She) and a drony dub bit (Dub About Me) and bunch of other forgettable tracks. For me Miss Kittin is at her best when she talk/sings in that oh-so-bored voice backed by a throbbing trance or house beat like Madame Hollywood with Felix da Housecat or Walk On By with The Hacker. The only three tracks that live up to this is",3.0
" No one can be miss kittin...And no better that her to be a featured artist...Miss Kittin & The Hacker....What a breathtaking electroclash couple...Miss kittin & felix da Housecat....Both made the best unforgiven era of contemprary glittery retro electro music with their 2001 'Kittinz & The Glitz'...Miss kittin & Golden Boy",3.0
" When I heard Miss Kittin was going to be launching her solo album without the production help of the Hacker or Golden Boy (with whom she's released one album each plus a few singles) I was skeptical to say the least. Considering the last time I heard a DJ set by her she spent a lot of the time vocalizing like a bad haunted house effects box or ghost cat I had little faith in how she would pull it together for a full length.The album is scattered with varied results. Some tracks are electroclash rockers like 'Meet Sue Be She' and 'Professional Distortion' although the lyrics are so awful that it really detracts from what is otherwise pretty decent music. It is refreshing that she isn't completely relying on her 'I'm bored I'm bored' schtick that brought her attention originally with tracks on which she sings quite well as well as more aggressive vocals (a la T.Raumschmiere's 'The Game Is Not Over').All this considered I suppose it's no great surprise that the best songs are produced by the Hacker and Smash TV. 'Soundtrack of Now' is light on the vocals and heavy on the stiff 4 to the floor sound that characterized the duo's album on Gigolo. 'Dub About Me' is a dub reworking of Smash TV's 'What About Me' (from their outstanding 2002 album 'Electrified' on BPitch Control) with floating vocals by Miss Kittin as well as the original vocoded vocals from Smash TV.While the album is a bit uneven honestly it's better than I had expected. Miss Kittin is more of an artist than her image tends to let on and she has proven capable of assembling a reasonable set of tracks. The genre-hopping doesn't always work but it's never dull. ",3.0
" ok so i finally got this cd the other day i've been waiting to buy it for months. well it's not so great. i mean it's not bad just nothing as jaw-dropping good as any of her collabos. the first single 'professional distortion' sounds like it was written to be a single but its pretty ok. it sounds a little matmos/aphex twin-ish the lyrics are a little silly (the lyrics only get worse the further the album goes making you almost wish that miss kittin would just sing/speak her vocals in french check out the 'rocker' meet sue be she the lyrics are cringe-inducingly bad.)another song (beat for a hit) could be good with the strange pairing of the kittin and some m.c. kind of going for a bit of slowed down ghetto tech. the song gets longish and very repetitive though. yea... the only song on the album that the hacker does the music for (soundtrack of now) is also almost all instrumental which is sad cuz its the best music on the album. so i'm sad because i really wish she would've just done another album with the hacker. he really seemed to know how to utilize her talents. this album is meandering and at times just kinda boring. it gets 3 stars cuz its still better than most crap that gets put out.

" 1.Professional Distortion - This is a great song it's wicked and would fit perfectly into the cd players of the guys with massive speakers in their cars. It's loud funky and the beat is one of the best i've ever heard. Cooly funny lyrics too. THey don't make sense. Gets boring quickly. 9/102.Requiem for a Hit - This song is sooo good! At first i hated it but it really grew on me with its incredibly simple beat and that synth that just pumps all the way through. It gets even better when Miss Kittin starts singing too. 7.5/103.Meet Sue Be She - Kind of annoying an obvious filler track. Miss kittin's voice makes me laugh again and the lyrics are woeful. But its a good song to jump around to. Pretty catchy though. 7/104.Happy Violentine - A bit of a long track but well worth the time for the experience. When i first heard it i was taken aback by Miss Kittin's songwriting talent almost flabbergasted. It gets even better when all the synths pianos and singing all manage to wind together nicely in the end. 9/105.Allergic - This song is cute and fun it's quite wierd it's very quiet and trance-like but still has a fast beat. It's unusual to the ears but its still an above average listen. 8/106.Kiss Factory - Easily the worst track on the album another filler. It doesnt make sense and its very annoying and generic. I guess one could call it catchy but i could never stand it even with 5+ listens. Turn it off please. 4/107.Clone Me - The best track on the album. It's got an awesome synth paced throughout the entire song like Requiem for a hit and is very danceable. Catchy beat and tune i love it. The lyrics like the lyrics in most of the album are nonsensical but you forget about them quickly. Great chorus - 'Hello Kittin you came to play Hello Kittin you look strange today...' 9.5/108.I Come.com - Lyrics are utter nonsense. The whispering at the beginning is kind of annoying but once the rhythmic singing comes in halfway through it gets very very good. And the way she distorts her voice is great too. 8.5/109.Soundtrack of Now - The only song on the album featuring The Hacker and thank god. This song is so annoying and is incredibly uncreative. It's a bit of a joke on this album and its about time Kittin dropped The Hacker once and for all. Worse song on the album. 2.5/1010.Neukolin - This is really just an experiment in music. It makes no sense and the only lyrics are a few words in german. It's very synthy and not pleasant to listen to. It's an experience. 6.5/1011.Dub About Me - Another slow long song but not as good as Happy Violentine. It's still very good and makes you think. It could do without the heavy jarring synth that comes through every now and then. 7.5/1012.3eme Sexe - BEST SONG EVER! This song sums up the album perfectly. It's a beautiful french ballad with a hint of electronica. If there's one song you need to listen to it's this one. Beautiful chorus beautiful music. Leaves you with good impressions of the album. A perfect 10/10. ",3.0

" I read about this book in a New Republic article about Lopez Obrador the leftist who recently lost in Mexico's presidential election. Obrador is from the southern state of Tabasco an isolated southern state that Greene visits in this book. Greene's interest in the state stems from the fact that in the 1930's the region's governor spearheaded one of the most virulent anti-religious campaigns in all of Mexico. Greene was commissioned to write about how Mexicans were coping during this period of intense suppression of religious expression. My interest in the book was purely historical and sociological; I wanted to better understand the ideology that led the state to clamp down on religious institutions and how ordinary Mexicans reacted to this. In that sense the book did not quite live up to my expectations. Instead in spite of the beautiful prose (which ensures a pretty quick read) and occasional sparks of wisdom the book read like a bitter disgruntled travelogue.For starters as Greene himself concedes his Spanish was apparently not so good at the time something that obviously limited his ability to talk with ordinary Mexicans who knew no English (this is not to mention that many of the Indians in Tabasco and Chiapas did not even speak Spanish). Tabasco and Chiapas are both built up at as hearts of darkness; he announces at the beginning of the book his intention to visit these remote places but he does not even reach Tabasco until halfway through the book as the first part consists of his journey from Texas down to Mexico City. And then when he finally does reach these places the effect is rather anti-climactic as he doesn't even seem to talk to any ordinary Mexicans about the religious situation. Obviously this probably had a lot to do with people's unwillingness to talk about such a politically sensitive issue but it was still disappointing that he went to so much effort to reach such remote places only to come away with so few real insights. In Tabasco and Chiapas the only people Greene seems to befriend are odball expatriate Europeans and Americans. These were fascinating characters and the stories of how they ended up in the backwaters of southern Mexico are worthy stories on their own but I think we would be critical of any contemporary journalist who only fraternizes with expats.Perhaps the most disturbing thing though is something that Sirin alludes to in his review (but surprisingly none of the other reviewers have mentioned) namely Greene's explicit hatred for the country and its people which was quite unexpected. As I was reading it I kept reminding myself of the context since the book was written in the 1930's from an obviously colonial mindset. However by the end of the book when Greene is tired ill and ready to return home the bitterness towards Mexico becomes hard to ignore. Virtually every behavioral trait he observes in Mexicans obviously hides sinister intentions. He has something bad to say about every place his train passes through. Again I realize that the author was fatigued from his travels and ill at this point but it still didn't make for particularly fun reading.I gave the book three stars because it does have many merits. As I mentioned Greene writes beautifully (I have read and loved the 'The Comedians' and plan to read some of his other novels in the near future). Also the simple fact that he visited some of these remote places during this interesting period of Mexico's history makes the book intrinsically interesting. Overall however the book just wasn't quite what I expected. ",3.0
" I was thrilled to hear about this book from a friend who suggested she was going to adopt for Advent a theme of thanksgiving and praise to God especially for the negative circumstances in her life. I felt this was an answer to a prayer since I'd been hoping to find some nice Christian fiction reading. So I found the book on amazon.com and bought it right away just in time for the start of Advent. The book initially seemed very good to promote these ideas. However since I have an M.A. in Theology from a Dominican school I had to try hard to overlook her harsh misrepresentation of Thomas Aquinas beginning on pg. 161. I set the book aside for a few hours and was able to return to it because I really enjoyed the earlier parts of the book. Then the author began again on pg. 173 and I just couldn't continue reading with her untruths. I had to wonder why she was so adamant about proving a wrong point and whether the other parts of her book were as unfounded as this.To expound - To classify Thomas Aquinas with the likes of Kant Calvin Rousseau - is utterly ridiculous to anyone who has any familiarity with the discipline of philosophy. If her statement is that they are philosophers and think (use their minds) and hence brought on the Age of Reason well this is superficially true. Does she regret the Age of Reason?If her statement is that reason when used to the exclusion of emotions is unbalanced her statement is true. However she is unaware of Aquinas's lengthy treatment of the emotions and their itegration in what he calls the 'intellect.' His definition of the intellect differs substantially from what we call the 'intellect' in our post-modern culture. The 'intellect' is much more expansive in his definition and does not act in exclusion to the emotions.In fact when I began to read his analysis of the emotions it was the healthiest description I'd encountered anywhere. He believes the emotions are all good all very natural. The emotions are our very personal and individual response to the environment to external stimuli and they simple are what they are. It is our response to the emotion and our consequent actions which are considered 'good' or 'bad.' We engage our intellect to decide what is good to do in each situation. The emotions themselves are completely integral to our healthy lives and cannot be judged.I am disappointed in yet another 'protestant' work which is misinformed about the very foundations of Christianity and chooses to bury an attack so deeply in its text. I was hoping for an uplifting and encouraging book to read.I will use this opportunity to suggest to ministers that the material you receive in your seminaries regarding the Catholic faith is incomplete and misinformed. Having spoken to numerous pastors about their scathing critiques of Catholicism they have admitted that their beliefs are based on their learnings at seminary. I have informed them they are factually mistaken in their teachings and to research for themselves. I will grant to author Catherine Marshall that Thomas Aquinas' seminal work 'Summa Theologica' is a very difficult read. Perhaps she relied on hearsay to form her opinions. I would encourage you to read and determine for yourself so you are not proven fallacious in your beliefs. You might enjoy it; I found it quite beautiful. ",3.0

" As the title indicates this book is about crucial confrontations. It starts off by defining what a crucial confrontation is and why we should care to have it. Then discusses how to know what crucial confrontation to hold and if one should hold it. After that comes what to do during a crucial confrontation and last but not least what to do after it. I believe that Crucial Confrontations are a crucial tool/mechanism that any successful leader should have in his arsenal. If used effectively it helps promote a culture of accountability which usually entails high performance and high engagement. This book explains in depth the process from start to finish both within a personal and work setting. The reason I gave this book a lower rating despite the very valuable content is that I felt that the material could have been more condensed and presented in a shorter more story-like format.

Almost singlehandly she manages to provide the movie with many moments of unbearable suspense though the directon is not too shabby. The director David Miller uses light and shadows to provide a good tension filled atmosphere and Gloria Grahamein a performance for which she was nomintated as best supporting actress also supplies great support and she is defintley a highlight. Jack Palance is very menacing in this movie and he also manages to do a good job. The script is not that original though and ultimatly the script is the problem with the movie.

" NOMADS OF SOUTH PERSIA was written in the 1950s when the (nearly always male) researchers tried to conform to a perceived scientific norm. At the time Barth wrote a book for specialists not for general readers and his work has become a minor classic in the field. However anthropology has gone through many a twist and turn since then. It is doubtful if many anthropologists want to read the same book today. I recently did. I have no idea whether nomadic life continues in Iran today or if it does--- (the New York Times recently reported a 'nomad conference' that took place in Ethiopia with some Iranian participation)---if it resembles the description in this book. We might call Barth's work 'social history' now. It is a book that gives no quarter to non-specialists. If you can't use industrial-strength kinship terminology you will have a hard time following several chapters. However there are a number of interesting matters for example the nomads' animals thrive best if kept to a nomadic life. Staying all year at one place increased mortality dramatically. More centrally nomad women had a stronger role to play than those in villages because their cooperation was an economic necessity. Decision making at the lowest level of nomadic society (chiefly about moving or not moving camp) was complex and subtle due to the relative independence of everyone and complex family relations. The connection of the Basseri nomads with other nomads and with the larger sedentary society was equally interesting. The tendency of richer nomads was to invest surplus money in land; the tendency of poorer nomads to leave the nomadic life and settle down as landless labor in villages. Barth contrasts nomad and sedentary not as separate ethnic groups so much but as different life patterns extant in the same country. A vast social gulf existed between powerful village landowners and the subject landless laborers but among nomads though all were subject to the chief each household maintained considerable freedom and as long as they had enough animals economic independence.Barth concentrated on describing economic social and political organization. There is virtually nothing else in the 153 pages. You can admire this focussed approach so typical of the time or you can regret the lack of a more humanistic style which would have allowed the nomads some voice given a reader more sense of people and place examined symbol and ritual to a far greater extent or provided some clue as to Barth's own role among the Basseri. Alas self-revelation was not often thought of in that era we can hardly blame him. What startled me was the information that the author spent only three months with the Basseri. I finished the book wondering how accurate his description was and how much reflected a fine theoretical mind with an innovative cast. Barth did seem to be properly cautious about what informants said but with three months he would not have had enough time to observe actual life. Thus if the author had stayed longer with the Basseri a different book might have been written. Like Margaret Mead Barth seems to have made the most out of a short period of field work. I can only admire him for that but questions do remain. ",3.0

" This movie had a limited theatrical release over a week ago out here in South Africa. I had the privilege of seeing this on DVD purchased from Amazon last month. Due to the lack of publicity marketing and it's limited release this feature did not do well at the box office out here. It is a great pity as this is one of Van Damme's better offerings. Fans that wants to see their hero doing his famous splits and martial arts moves will be disappointed but if you are wanting a good old-fashioned action adventure without any elaborate special effects which seems to have taken over movie making these days Legionnaire fits the bill. Good battle sequences foreign legion heroics some sweeping desert photography plus a strong supporting cast makes this Van Damme entry a worthwhile one.

" I think the television listing description I read on this movie was misleading - actually no it was wrong. According to what my TiVo said the story followed a 1920s playboy who returns from a stint in the Foreign Legion to reclaim his former lover (a mobster's girl). Obviously the person who wrote this has never seen this movie. For starters he wasn't so much a playboy as he was a boxer and for second he never returns to France to reclaim his former lover. In fact we learn through the progress of the film that the woman in question has emigrated to the United States.Okay enough gripes about how inaccurate tv listings can be - what did I think about the movie in question. It's actually okay as far as Jean Claude VanDamme movies go except he really doesn't do much in the way of martial arts as he has in previous films. Instead he relies more on a rifle to shoot charging North African tribesmen or fists to straighten out fellow Foreign Legionnaire's who get their kicks out of bullying their weaker colleagues.Jean Claude plays a boxer who after reneging on a promise to throw a fight escapes into the French Foreign Legion to flee the clutches of a murderous mobster. There he is flung headfirst into the North Africa war between the local nomadic tribesmen and the occupying French forces.What was really a treat was the presence of Steven Berkoff. It's been awhile since I have seen him in a movie. He was a very high profile in the early to mid 1980s in movies such as `Beverly Hills Cop' `Octopussy' and `Rambo",3.0
" Here in Japan this film was given a limited theatrical release. in 2001. Before I see this movie I knew this film went straight to video in USso I didn't expect much fun from it. Frankly the plot is a dull one; the situation is borrowed from the typical 'leginnaire' films like Beau Geste and there is nothing new nor original here. Well and for fans of the previous films of the star it must be disappointing because there is no bone- crunching action scenes. Still it has good authentic location and superb supporting cast including Steven Berkoff and Nicholas Farrell. My favorite actor Steven Berkoff displays his over-the-top acting (though a bit overacting you may think) and I find it very delightful and Nicholas Farrell's subtle performance is giving some reason for not avoiding the video. Not a classic but good one of the genre. ",3.0

" I did like this initially and thought this type of lid would be more secure and splatter-proof. But it can be a pain to clean and still splatters even if I pre-treat the rice. After having this a year the plastic never seems to look or smell right no matter how hard I clean it. I stopped making soups and steaming and decided to just stick to rice because of the 'smell' factor to the plastic. My teflon pan is discolored too - although I'm very careful to only use plastic with it and gentle cleansers. I hesitate between a 2 or 3 star review because...the Sanyo is cute  it has cooked rice predictably and for the first couple months I really liked it. It just doesn't seem to hold up to long-term use. IronicallyI picked up an old Hitachi chime-a-matic for $3 at a thrift store and like it a lot more than my Sanyo (which will be going to goodwill). I like the removable lid better on the Hitachi and the aluminum pan (in Teflon vs. aluminum I actually feel better about aluminum). ",3.0

" Having used several rice cookers in the past given the Chinese blood running in our family (this is an indispensible appliance to us!) I am a bit disappointed at this one. It is slower than the previous ones I had (Hitachi Panasonic) -- eg the same quantity of rice which cooked in 20mn takes more than 1/2 hr -- and what I didn't realize is that the chord is neither detachable nor retractable making it very awkward to move it around to clean serve reorganize my countertop.... Also it seemed prone to leaks at first (wasn't sealing properly? the rubber needed to break in I guess)... time will tell whether it is as durable as the other brands. Another important point is that it took several cleaning/boiling sessions for us to get rid of the chlorine smell of the (supp. PVC) white plastic steaming basket. I like its simplicity though. ",3.0
" I purchased this rice cooker to replace my 30 year old (yes 30) National unit. It cooks rice well enough no better or worse than my older one but at least it has the warming feature that my older one did not have. It also works very well as a steamer. However there are two problems with this unit that are somewhat annoying. First there is no 'on/off' switch so if it is plugged in the warming function is on so you cannot just leave it sitting on the counter top plugged in. The second issue is that in my case water collects between the inner and outer walls of the unit (I am guessing that the 'dew collector' on the back is overflowing) requiring that I invert the unit and shake the water out.Overall it is not a bad unit but in my opinion Sanyo cut a few corners in an effort to keep the price down and it results in a less than ideal appliance ",3.0

" For some reason I always manage to botch rice the old fashioned way. Not enough water too much water too much heat. It never turns out right which is why I bought a rice maker. I also love steel cut oats which the reviews said this machine also cooked with ease. I used it a lot when I first bought it and it cooked everything very well. However I don't know if something on the machine broke or if I'm now doing something wrong but every time I try to cook my steel cut oats the lid opens up on its own and a gooey starchy mess of boil-over spills down the sides and onto my counter. When the lid opens up it also allows the water to evaporate and doesn't cook the oats properly (sometimes they're still a little crunchy). Also when there's a boil over mess it takes a lot of effort to clean all of the nooks and crannies on this machine. At first I didn't notice that there's some kind of plastic container thing on the back...and I didn't notice it until it started smelling of rotten something-or-other because dirty rice/oat water had been fermenting in it for several weeks. On cleaning the insert is really easy to wash even if you let it sit after cooking because it's nonstick. The rest of the machine including the lid and the lid gasket is a huge pain to clean if you don't wipe it down while it's still warm...and I'm notoriously bad about doing that. For this reason the rice maker has been stuck in a closet for several months now. Perhaps I'll dig it out again and give it another go because it really does a lovely job making rice...but since rice is only half the reason I bought it (oats being the other) for now it's way more of a pain to use than it's worth.

" I bought this rice cooker several months ago after researching all the options. In general I've been quite pleased with it. It makes tasty rice; the metal insert is easy to clean and the closed design prevents it from making that annoying clanking noise that occurs with cheaper rice cookers (i.e. the sound of the lid bouncing around as air escapes). For better or worse however it takes forever to actually make rice. A single 1 cup batch of rice can take 30+ minutes to cook. This means that I have started a 'quick' stir-fry on several occasions only to realize that my rice wouldn't be done for at least 10 minutes after the other food was on the table. Usually this can be circumvented by starting the rice before all the other food but I still find it somewhat inconvenient. One should also be aware of the tiny plastic drainage cup in the back of the machine. It does accumulate water from the cooking process so it should be cleaned regularly. Otherwise it gets gross. Overall I find this to be a very nice rice cooker. It does make good rice. It is not fast though so if you're looking for a quick machine this is not your best option. ",3.0
" A friend of mine spent a summer in Japan and came back with a Minidisc recorder and several compilations of crazy Japanese music. He'd lost all the artists names but one track named 'Doubt' caught my attention.Well two weeks ago I bought this on a whim because the cover looked neat. Once in my hands it looked even better but while I listened to the first track and scanned over the track list I noticed a song called 'Doubt' and then quickly associated the vocals I was hearing with the long-lost song. I quickly jumped to 'Doubt' and was treated to an alternate recording that I wasn't familiar with though it was clear that it was the same song. After a few moments of searching the internet I'm introduced to Hide. (the version I knew is usually labeled 'Doubt '97' or 'Doubt (Mixed LEMONed Jelly Mix').For a westerner Hide's solo work is pretty spotty. Three albums and a smattering of singles across the mid-90s much of it sounding like high-speed pop music with soaring solos and dripping with cheese. As far as I can tell Hide is to hair metal what hair metal is to heavy rock bands. After an evening sampling Hide's solo project it became pretty clear why his music needed to be 'altered' if he wanted any kind of success in the west. I'm not sure if jumping on the over-engineered industrial metal train was the best approach.While technically competent none of the tracks really stick with me (aside from 'Doubt' for obvious reasons). 'Fuctrack#6' is an embarrassing introduction to the tail end of the disc. By the time it comes on you'll be thirty minutes deep and you might as well stick around for what follows -- some of Hide's heavier tracks borrowed and re-recorded.Make no mistake this is Hide's attempt to bring his music to the west. Ray McVeigh and Paul Raven are here as well as a closet full of friends but nobody really takes the stage away from Hide. Don't buy this for the guest appearances list you'll be sorely disappointed -- for example Jaz Coleman shouts for less than a minute opposite some broad who wants to 'f you up the a until you bleed'. Hmm. And what exactly Geordie and Chris Vrenna contributed to all this I haven't been compelled enough to open up the booklet and figure out just yet.Unfortunately Hide passed away before this album was released. In America only a handful of fans of X Japan and whoever picked up the Heavy Metal 2000 soundtrack ever noticed. Don't let that stop you from checking it out if you're fascinated with this era or this sound but don't expect a lost gem. ",3.0
" Part of hide's charm was his free-wheeling venture into all different styles of rock music. Here the american producers of the album seem to have targeted it to a particular industrial-explicit niche losing a lot of the lightness humor and experimentation found in hide's other albums.

The musicians are excellent and the mix great but I don't find any of the songs particularly memorable. ",3.0

" A Philadelphia Catholic in King James Court was an ok book. Michael O'shea and his family move to Kentucky to live with his uncle after his father dies. Michael learns a lot more about his religion than he already knew and he also learned a little bit about his uncle's religion. Michael is forced to defend his faith to his uncle's church members and elders. This book is mainly about the arguing of Catholics and fundamentalists. Catholics believe that the bible is from tradition and fundamentalists believe that the bible is the final say in what they do. I also thought that the book was really unrealistic. What kind of teenager would spend a whole summer studying his catholic faith? I know the way that I am going to do work in the summer is if I am in summer school or I have to do work for the future school year. I also would not expect a 14 year old kid to be reciting bible passages in the middle of his sentences to back up his thoughts.

It was a good book in that the book explained and supported the Catholic faith strongly. It showed me some things in the Bible that I did not know were there. Although it explained most of the aspects of the Catholic faith in depth the presentation of these ideas was in a boring manner. It was just plain talk and no excitement. Also there we some things in the book I could not believe were true. I thought about how Michael's whole summer revolved around the Bible and work. There was no play fun or friends just dedication to the Bible. I found that hard to believe because many teens want to have fun along with having a faith. Michael just had a faith it seemed. Also I thought it was hard to believe how Michael started down in Kentucky not knowing alot about the Bible and by the end of three months he knew more than his uncle who had been studying the Bible for years.

For example the author talks about how he likes the city and the country but hates the suburbs which I feel resents me and my lifestyle on page 20. The story was quite simple and a little uninteresting because the timing of the story was a little unrealistic and slow in the sense that the author tried to fit everything in during the one summer Mike was at the farm. Mike's character didn't fit any type of teenager that I know and I couldn't relate to the story through Mike in any other sense other than the Catholic sense. The story was full of religious concepts and conflicts but didn't have much relation to a teenager's problems my troubles and confusions. A Philadelphia Catholic In King James's Court was a complete story with a plot that could flare an interest in people who have encountered Apologetics in their life but did not flare my interests. I consider the story to be a good basis on Catholic beliefs and a good understanding of the conflicts between religions. This was a good book in the aspect of religion and a good book for the faithful Catholic or Protestant but not for many other types of people. ",3.0
" I felt a Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a pretty good book but it lacked an entertaining plot and some aspects of the book were unusual. It was a good book in that it explained and supported the Catholic faith strongly. It showed me some things in the Bible that I did not know were there. Although it explained most of the aspects of the Catholic faith in depth the presentation of these ideas was in a boring manner. It was just plain talk and no excitement. Also there were some things in the book I could not believe were true. I thought about how Michael's whole summer revolved around the Bible and work. There was no play fun or or frineds just dedication to the Bible. I found that hard to believe because many teens want to have fun along with with having faith. Michael just had a faith it seemed. Also I thought it was hard to bleieve how Michael started down in Kentucky not knowing alot about the Bible and by the end of the summer he knew more than his uncle who had been studying the Bible for years. Although it had these minor flaws I thought the book was very informative and it helped me understand my own faith a little better. ",3.0
" Although this book was not very exciting in my opinion it gave me some new insights on Fundamentalist and Catholic views of the Bible. There is some background information in the story about the Bible and its meaning. It explains passages from certain sections in the Bible and gives some understanding to the time when it was written. I also learned about Fundamentalists and their view of Biblical interpretation. If you decide to purchase this book I recommend that you pay close attention to how the Fundamentalists sometimes contradict themselves and also how Michael (the main character) approaches the scripture. This book is great if you are interested in learning about the Catholic or Protestant religions or want to know what certain sections of the Bible mean. ",3.0
" Yo The book A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a nice book I enjoyed readin it very much. The book had a deeper meaning then what was on the surface. The story is about a boy named Mike. Mike's dad dies in a fire in the beginning of the story because of this his mom and siblings move to Kentucky with his cousins. Mike very much likes Kentucky and the farm at which they are staying at yet his uncle Les pressures him very much to become part of the Fundelmentalist church. Mike wants to stay Catholic because that is what his laid father was. The book explains mikes problems exposure opinion and experiences. The book was very insightful to a catholic who was learning about his faith like I am. This is not only a good read it would be perfect for teens or adults. It presents the reasoning on both sides very effectively and realistically. Because the defenses are in the context of an interesting novel I found myself more able to follow the line of reasoning. thank u for ur time ",3.0
" This book really showed me that although Christians share the same basic beliefs the denominations are very different from each other. In this book Michael a teen from Philadelphia takes on his uncle's town of Bible-wielding maniacs in Kentucky. Michael all but shows up these maniacs by expressing his Catholic views through scripture. The part about this book that is confusing is the fact that Michael can defeat a group of men who have been studying the Bible their whole lives after reading just a few commentaries on the Bible. ",3.0
" When I first was presented this book in class I figured it would be a corny 'love everyone' book (like the typical religion textbook). I was pleasantly surprised at its ability to keep me awake (most of the time); however it's only the first step towards apologetic novels that can be truly effective. The beginning portion is rather boring and full of unnecessary drivel. The portion in which he absorbs the Biblical knowledge later used in arguments seemed as if de Porres wrote that at the last minute for two reasons. Firstly he hardly refers to any of the information that Michael cites in his speeches despite saying in subtext that he did so. Secondly how could anyone absorb all that Biblical interpretation in such a short time let alone use it effectively? This stemmed out into other smaller contradictions which made it hard to read between the lines at times. Beyond that de Porres made readable what many could not",3.0
" A Philadelphia Catholic in King Jame's Court starts out a tragic turn of events. Michael and his family lose their father in a fire. His family is now going to move to they country and out of the city with his uncle and his family on their farm. The story really gets going as Michael adjusts to his new lifestyle. His uncle Les is a very religious man. Having once been a Catholic he converted to Fundamentalist because of differences in beliefs. Michael too started to question his religion. Yet he realized that Catholics had a different way of viewing the bible mass and Traditions. Michael spoke at Les's church in discussions explaining and proving Catholicism to the Fundamentalists. In this book you will see many controdictions and inconsistencies in Les's religion.This book is great for finding out for what you believe and what your religion means to you. It points out many problematic areas of the church and clears them out. Martin De Porres Kennedy wrote this book well and I think that it does its job; in explaining Catholicism. I never thought this book would be one that I'd enjoy but it turned out to be a very good read and an informational book. ",3.0
" A Philadelphia in King James Court is a good book to read to learn more about the catholic faith but if you were interested in reading a pleasure book you wouldn't be satisfied. Personally I didn't like the book it was a very well written and formatted book but it was also very boring. I like books with suspense and this was more of a strait forward book explaining the differences between the Catholic Church and the fundamentalist. The Catholic being Michael and his father who had died and the Fundamentalist being Les Michaels Uncle. Michael O'Shea is a 17 year old boy who is living a normal life when unexpectedly his father died in a fire. Michael had to move down south with his Uncle where he learns about their religions and about his own religion also. This is where we learn about the way of a fundamentalist compared to our Catholic religion. Even though I did not like the book I learned a lot about it in Mr. Puntel's class the book itself was very boring but when you take it into a classroom or a study you can learn a lot about your faith and about the faith of the people around you. ",3.0
" This book is good and bad in some parts. It makes sense what Michael is explaining but if you think about it it doesn't make any sense. Michael moved from Philadelphia to Georgia/Alabama/SOUTH because his dad died in a heroic effort to save someone. First of all why would he leave there and second why would he go to the south instead of with relatives or back to their house in Philly. The arguments Michael presents make sense and he destroys what the fundamentalists say so much that they throw him out of the south. How does Michael learn all of this does it pop in to his head one morning and he decides to start bashing on the people he is living with and go against his mothers brothers religion. If I was his mom I would slap him and leave the south because there is no reason for him to go against it. Michael meets Les who is the leader of the local church and he has a sermon about go-between people. He says they are wrong and then when the sermon is over he decides to question the person who he is living with on his morals and religion. Les cannot explain the final answer to his sermon because he doesn't know the answer to it. The same thing happens when they go to mass at a catholic church down south. The pastor gives a sermon and Michael has no clue what he is talking about so he asks the pastor what he meant and he failed to answer him also. Then Michael realizes somehow that the fundamentalists are wrong about everything so he starts arguing with local fundamentalist leaders. In the end Michael is kicked out of the south for arguing with the head fundamentalist guy and I guess he goes back to live inPhilly with his friends. This book is good on the issues but there are key things missing to the plot. ",3.0
" as i first started reading this book i couldent stand it. it was boring and pointless. i didnt know why i was reading it but after a few chapters it got better. i found out i was reading this book because it explains some things about the catholic church like why catholics have a pope and why catholics honor mary. this is a good book to read for anyone who is thiking of becoming a catholic or for catholics who do not agree with certain church teachings. eventually this book became a book i actually wanted to read instead of just reading it because it explained things about the cathoolic church. it had a good plot. i would give this book 3 stars because it was not too boring and it was very education. ",3.0
" Overall this was a pretty good book with a good story line yet I found many faults. I couldn't seem to understand that Michael could learn so much about his faith and the Bible in so little time. I think many parts of this book were greatly exaggerated. I also looked at the book in other ways too. I understood my religion more and now I have a clear understanding of the difference between Biblical Fundamentalists and Catholics. I see the flaws in Fundamentalism and now I know good arguments to prove Fundamentalists wrong. ",3.0
" I found a Philadelphia Catholic in King James' Court to be a very insightful book. This book talks about the struggles a boy undergoes when he is confronted by his uncle who just so happens to be a Biblical Fundamentalist. His uncle tries to show the boy that being a Biblical Fundamentalist is the proper way to worship and that he should join him as a Fundamentalist at his church. This book is a great book to read if you are trying to find your faith as a Catholic. ",3.0
" This book was interesting. It was interesting to see how Michael defended his own Catholic faith against the fundamentalists. I have to be honest and say that if this book had been an optional reading assignment I would have opted not to. On the other hand I am glad in a way that it was not optional because at the end of the story I had learned some things and been given some new ideas that I had not had before. I read this book with more of an understanding of the protestant side being a Presbyterian (even though I have become familiar with the Catholic practice in Mr. Puntel's class at LaSalle College High School). Some of the things mentioned by Michael in this story were foreign at first but through class discussions I was able to get a better understand and learn some new things about the Catholic Faith that I had not yet picked up in my textbook. I would say that if you are looking for a thriller to read that this is not exactly the type of book you want to read but if you are looking to learn something new about both Catholic and Protestant Christianity this book would be an excellent start.

" A Philadelphia Catholic in King James' Court is about a boy named Michael who after his father dies goes to live with family in Kentucky for the summer. There he struggled to keep his identity as a Catholic from all of the ensuing remarks of the Bible Fundamentalists.

" I felt that 'A Philadelphia Catholic in King James' Court' was a well written book with a couple minor flaws. This book was about a young teenager named Michael who moved to Kentucky to live with his uncle for the summer. While there he learned many things. He learned that he didn't know everything about his own religion and he also studied a totally different religion. I felt that this book taught me many things. The book taught me about the beliefs of Fundamentalists. The book even taught me things I didn't know about my own religion. A Philadelphia Catholic depicts the differences between the two religions. The Fundamentalists believe that the Bible must be taken word for word; while the Catholics believe in the Bible they also base some of their religion on traditions. This book also had a couple flaws. I felt that the book was unrealistic. A teenager wouldn't spend his/her summer reading and studying about their religion as well as another religion. Another flaw was that even if a teenager studied about these religions he wouldn't become an expert so quickly. I found that rather than enjoying the book I learned from the book.. It seemed that the book was more like a text than it was a story. Overall the book was good but the flaws prevented me from giving the book five stars. ",3.0

" When our class was assigned this book to read like everyone else I thought it would be another boring book that we were being forced to read. But much to my surprise I learned a lot about the Bible and the Catholic religion. I personally did not enjoy this book. Although it is well written it is not for those who enjoy action and suspense. The main character is Michael O'shea. He is a 17 year old boy living a normal life in Philadelphia until his father dies in a fire. After his father's death he moves down south to live with his uncle Les who is a Fundamentalist. While Michael is living with his uncle he learns the differences between Catholics and Fundamentalists. For instance he learns why the Catholic Bibles have more books than the Fundamentalist Bibles and why Catholics have a Pope.This book would not be satisfying to a reader just reading a book for enjoyment. I would not recomend this book to any non-Catholic readers. All in all I think that this book is for school discussion only. ",3.0

The reason why it was just pretty good is because there was nothing exciting that made me want to keep reading. It was overall a good book but it didnt have anything exciting for me. ",3.0

" 'The Sinful Dwarf' is a Danish/American production which actually played in theaters in Denmark (I've talked people to who saw the 'shocking' premiere). The lead actor Torben Bille is one the most recognized dwarf actors in Denmark...I guess he would rather forget this ultra bizarre piece of sexploitation.Torben lures innocent young girls to his mom's house with help of mechanical toy poodles. They are drugged and tied up and later abused by 'clients' and/or sold into slavery. In between Dwarf and his drunk mom are doin' several musical numbers. The many sex scenes are pretty close to porn and the soundtrack reminded me of the Residents. It's like an insane mix between 'Bloodsucking Freaks' and 'Pink Flamingos' with zero comic relief - this movie will blow your mind. Trash film mogul Harry Novak also backed 'Please Don't Eat My Mother' 'Kiss Me Quick' etc. ",3.0
" From grindhouse and sleaze-meister Harry Novak and out of the deepest recesses of the 70's came - 'Dvrgen' ('The Sinful Dwarf') AKA 'Das Haus der verlorenen Madchen' 1973 and directed by Vidal Raski. Three minutes into the film we knew this was going to be one sick ride! 'Olaf' (Torben Bille) had a penchant for young innocent girls (who were also naive enough to fall for the charms of a devilish looking dwarf with wind up toys!) as he lured them to follow him home to become unwitting sex slaves! Oh and his pleasant mother 'Lila' (Clara Keller) actually encouraged this behaviour since it brought in additional income. When a young unsuspecting couple 'Mary' and 'Peter' (Anne Sparrow and Tony Eades) suddenly showed up looking for a room to let Olaf obligingly agreed (when a dwarf jumps on the bed in the room you're looking to rent and says in a Danish accent..'you see...it is a nice soft bed' and lets off a sinister cackle. Maybe it's not a good idea and politely you would say thanks but no thanks!!) and took them upstairs. Did I mention that mother 'Lila' (not to be confused with 'Lola') appeared to be a washed-up cabaret performer (she definitely did not play the 'Blue Angel') and had an inclination to dress up and sing after her drinking sessions! This flick is pretty sick and sleazy but believe it or not it's done in such a campy and looney way that you will actually find yourself laughing along with cuddly Olaf and his dear mother!!! I won't give anymore away. This is the triple xxx version (the film elements do not match but they do not appear to be inserts) so there was more than just poor naked gals! The actress that played Mary (Anne Sparrow) was actually pretty good and she definitely had a lovely figure! But its really 'Olaf' and 'Lila' that stole the show here we even got a quick glimpse at 'Lila's' disfigured body (just kidding actually the old dame was in pretty good shape. I would have wanted to see more of her with singing of course!!) she did have a scar along her left cheek (on her face do pay attention)! This was an American-Danish co-production and as I've written so many times before only in the 70's could they have gotten away with a barbaric and sadistic piece of work like this one ( but of course plenty of enthusiasts like myself already knew that) it's pretty bad. The reason I'm only giving it 3 stars the pacing was slow and unfortunately the production-values here were very low ($10000.00 more from uncle Harry could have raised the bar!) not the best lighting or camera work.

" I watched this movie yesterday on a lovely Saturday afternoon. Maybe i should have went to the beach because all this movie did was make me restless. Yes indeed it was a quality movie with great acting by Ian Mckellen and Lynn Redgrave. The thing that ruined it for me was Brenden Fraser. I believe he was miscast. It seems as though they gave him the part because he looks so much like Frankenstein. He should have played Frankenstein and someone like Pauly Shore could have played 'Boon'. (just kidding of course!)The overall look of the film was beautiful. It had alot of style. Another problem I had with Gods and Monsters though were the doldrum periods of the plot where Whale and Boon would sit around and psycho-babble with each other and try and pick each others brains apart. They did this too many times in the film and the reluctancy of Boon was a real turn off. Brenden Fraser does play a GREAT homophobe! I also found it repulsive that Whale allowed Boon back into his life even after Boon degrated him and did nothing short of spitting in his face. Whale should have just kicked him to the curb!The part I don't understand is why Whale had such a fascination with Boon. Why did he do so much for this guy? Boon came off as such a jerk a no brains kind of guy an opportunist. Was Boon just a piece of you know what to Whale? If so that is really sad that he chose to cherish and embrace someone like Boon. That's what I didn't like about this film! The weak characters! ",3.0
" A promising movie that never finally delivers. The acting is very good most of the time. The use of a few moviestar look-alikes was fun. Brendan Fraser was ok. He could have had more depth and more presence. Ian McKellen was terrific. His devilish weak-lipped wry smile carried the film as it does in his other films. The Frankenstein myth was interpolated into a grander metaphor to some extent but not to complete satisfaction. I pretty much 'got it' by the middle of the movie and was expecting the movie to traverse some higher plateau on the back of the conflict and metaphor but it never really got there and the second half didn't add a whole lot of sparkle. I was disappointed. It didn't live up to being what I had been expecting from all the glowing reviews. Like the monster it had all the parts but there wasn't any transforming thunderclaps no touch of the gods. The ending was rather simple not at all profound and the last scene was a bit contrived even silly in an amateur film-school kind of way. I suspect others are taken with this film more by the nostalgia it conjures than by the dramatic resolution of its storyline. It's just not the great film of its reputation. It's worth watching but there are many films worth watching and many others I'd much more recommend for your time. This one you could easily go without unless maybe you're a real Frankenstein or gay buff but even then it's not sufficiently strong on either of those themes. It had great potential. It was 'close but no cigar'--or maybe that should have been Mr. Whale's line.My review update",3.0

" I hadn't read this one of Heinlein's in many many years when I picked it up and was leafing through it in search of an answer to a trivia question. Doing this with any Heinlein novel is dangerous; in short order I was snagged into re-reading the entirety of this one. Heinlein has often been cited by many of today's scientists and engineers as their inspiration for getting into the sciences and this book is a prime example of why. As the story of Matt Dodson young man in training to be a Space Patrol officer it is a very typical adolescent-to-man portrayal. The first half of the book deals with his training from the rigorous testing to eliminate those who don't have what it takes to descriptions of the myriad of subjects an officer is expected to know. The second half details his experiences and on-the-job training as a school graduate from long boring hours in space transit to the finding of a missing Patrol ship to his experiences in the art of negotiation with Venusian natives. At no point does this book ever become boring; I fully believe Heinlein could have written a twenty page exposition on watching grass grow and kept his readers totally engrossed. Some of the details he presents on the art of astrogation and space flight may go over the heads of some younger readers of this book but it is precisely such details that will get those readers interested in studying such subjects.This book was written in 1948 and some allowances must be made for that reason such as the description of Venus as mainly a hot and very wet but habitable planet (at the time he wrote this this was one of the main scientific suppositions about conditions on the this planet). At the same time it is quite incredible just how accurate he was in describing everything from rocket ship design fuels space walks space sickness space habitats eating utensils designed for space use the utility of a global peace-keeping force (such as the U.N. which was just being formed when this was written) and even predicted the use of microwaves for cooking (this prediction is hidden in a throw away one-liner comment typical for Heinlein as he quite correctly portrays the inventions of the future as mere commonplaces of their time).Some have called this a watered-down version of Starship Troopers and there is some validity to this point as there is very little of the heavy philosophy that characterized Starship Troopers here (although like all of his 'juvenile' novels there are strong threads running throughout on the importance of honesty duty personal responsibility and the proper role of government) but much of the same flavor regarding military organizations.Other than Matt himself the characterizations are somewhat one-dimensional in some cases near caricatures drawn with broad strokes. This is not necessarily bad in a book intended for young readers who have not yet reached the sophistication to see the world in many shades of gray but is a little grating for the adult readers. The depiction of Burke supposedly good enough to survive all the testing and early training for the Space Patrol but so dunderheaded as to effectively kidnap a local Venusian 'mother' and not see anything wrong with his actions is especially grating.This book was the basis for an attempt at a TV serial",3.0
" Not Heinlein's best boy's book but a good one. I hadn't read this one in many many years and it didn't hold up quite as well as the one in my memory. But at any rate in today's world a half-century after Heinlein first published this book I really appreciate how Heinlein hammered in the need to look with respect at those who are different from ourselves specifically in regard to Oz's work with the Venerians. The 360 on the 'pie with fork' lesson was great.I also like how the book's protagonist Matt isn't necessarily the sharpest pencil in the box. He works hard he tries hard he makes mistakes and he tries to do the right thing. But it's often other characters who take the stereotypical hero's spotlight. I think there's an important lesson in there that Heinlein tries to impart.As is often the case Heinlein is pretty harsh on parents especially mothers but I made a decision long ago that this is simply part of Heinlein's baggage and his many positives outweigh this negative theme.

" There aren't many operatic versions of 'Sleeping Beauty' so it was a delight to realize that the composer of 'The Pines and Fountains of Rome' had produced this charming work back in the 1920s (revised in 1933). Interest was piqued by a recent production at Spoleto (Charleston) which traveled to Lincoln Center this past summer. I didn't attend either of these productions but the reviews caught my attention and I ordered this the only recording of the work that I know of. The piece is pretty well conducted and overall well sung although the Italian diction is not as idiomatic as one would wish from this (mostly) Slovak cast. Guillermo Dominguez (Prince April) and Adriana Kohutkova (Blue Fairy/Nightengale) are standouts. It's a lovely work that certainly deserves another recording this time with plummy Italian voices that are more comfortable with Respighi's style. I have to admit that the Act III setting in the 1930s from the 'fairy tale time' of Acts I and II is something of a shock especially the appearance of an ugly American (Mr. Dollar Checques) and the 'fox trot' finale. Perhaps more sympathetic performers could have brought it off. ",3.0

" This is one of five of The Steve Miller Band's first five albums that's gotten a well deserved new mastering job. Thankfully there's no compression that makes good sounding older period music hard (or impossible) to listen to. Or any bad remixing that also destroys the original sound we all remember. The sound on this reissue is clean and fairly crisp with a bit of warmth reminiscent of the original LP mix. Is this a quantum leap in sound quality? No but it does sound good. Sound is so subjective-what one person hears as good-another hears either nothing better-or hears even worse sound.I've read that the EQ on these discs is overly bright. But I'm just wondering with new mastering using present day equipment if we're now able to hear more detail in the high end than on previous issues. That may cause some listeners to hear it as slightly brighter. Listening to the album 'Children of the Future' (with that great original LP side-long suite on 'Side One') for example I can hear much more detail on the higher end-acoustic guitars are more discernible in the background as are snippets of background vocals. But I have to say that I never thought this particular album (the original vinyl LP) sounded all that great a bit muddy sounding-even with Glyn Johns at the controls-but that may be just me. On the other hand the band's next (vinyl LP) album 'Sailor' sounded much better to my ears-again with Glyn Johns producing. As I said sound is so subjective.Since this particular album has been difficult (or impossible) to find I thought I'd choose this new edition for review along with a bit on the other four albums. The disc is snapped inside a tri-fold cardboard holder with a pocket for the 11 page booklet. The booklet has a few photographs from Miller's personal files and an essay based on a recent interview with Miller. The other new editions are similar in format.Overall this is a worthwhile album (and one of my favorites) but not the best effort by the band-now reduced to the core trio of Miller Lonnie Turner-bass/guitar/background vocals and the great Tim Davis-drums/background vocals. This is before Miller's approach changed somewhat to more pop leaning radio friendly songs and his orignal band had splintered. The core trio is augmented with the addition of either Ben Sidran or Nicky Hopkins on keyboards and Glyn Johns or Minor Wilson on guitar. Davis really shines vocally on the song 'Your Saving Grace' where his lead vocal makes you wonder why he didn't get more of a chance to sing. And check out 'Little Girl' and 'Just A Passin' Fancy In A Midnite Dream' for a bit of that old Miller Band sound. Another good song is 'Don't Let Nobody Turn You Around' but fans will have their own favorites.There's no extra tracks on this edition but the lyrics are included. But for instance the first Miller Band album does contain the song 'Sittin' In Circles' as a bonus. On first listen it doesn't seem to really fit in with the original album-the song sounds to 'poppy' and a bit lightweight but it's good to have it included. The sound on all these albums is similarly good so if you've wanted to replace your old CD copies (or couldn't find them on CD-like this particular album) this is a chance to own them with good sound and updated (but not in depth) liner notes and photos. Hopefully the price will come down some for these albums but even if that doesn't happen this is a chance to hear these albums with much more agreeable sound.I've been waiting for someone to reissue these albums with new mastering (and extra tracks-oh well) which does justice to the band's sound. I just wish that someone would release all the old period Miller Band music that's still squired away in the vaults-along with the live sets that are still hidden away-or maybe an all inclusive box set encompassing the first five albums and related studio and live tracks-maybe someday. But for now these new editions are well worth hearing. ",3.0

They whine and scream more often than not and the comic relief is painfully uncomfortable. The main character... a young new recruit... is a noise machine. If she's not screwing up she's pontificating and just won't shut up. The even bigger problem with that is she's not the loudest of the bunch.

" For those buying this Deadly China Hero dvd you are getting a [junky] version of the original film Last Hero In China. The distributors for Deadly.. are known for bootleggin movies and cutting scenes out so look for the right one if you intend to check this film out. This film is the Jet's second to the last installment to the Once Upon A Time In China (OUATIC) series. It's nothing spectacular in my opinion but it's not a bad film either. Tsui Hark who did the original OUATIC series is not a part of this film; instead the dirty Wong Jing directed this film which kind of hurt it a bit. Yuen Woo Ping still provided the choreography but I've seen better. Wong's aunt or love interest (Rosamund Kwan) is also out of this picture. Jet plays Wong Fei Hung once again and he moves his school temporarily to a new location. The school ends up next to a brothel Fei Hung soons discovers corruption and kidnappings of women taking place around the town. Officials want to get rid of him and of course Wong wants to save everybody as usual. This is probably all you'd need to know about the story because it really is not that interesting. Right from the start I could not take this film seriously at all. It was trying pretty hard to be funny and sometimes it worked other times it failed miserably. It felt like watching a parody of OUATIC. The MA were good but not great; there was simply too much wirework and fake elements involved. It's one thing if the movements look real but wirework was pretty bad in this film. There's a scene where a bad official slaps his hands on tiles and this brings them up flying at Wong; all of a sudden the official decides to literally swim or glide across the ground afterwards...couldn't help thinkin what was the point of it was but anyways. The bad official (Alan Chui?) also has one of the most annoying laughs you'll ever hear. There were bits and pieces of battles that stood out but not one ENTIRE fight scene impressed me. The Shaolin Master Killer Gordon Liu(Lau Kar Fai) was also in the film as a bad guy but director Wong Jing clearly wasted Liu's talents by not using them. In addition the outcome of his final battle is pretty pathetic. There is a fight between Liu and Jet that starts off decent until the flying elements came into play...sigh...like I said bits and pieces. Cheung Man is also in the film but her MA is strictly wire based and made her look like a ballerina...nothing impressive. As everyone already mentioned here the last battle involves Jet in a chicken suit fighting a group of baddies dressed as a centipede. It's kind of silly but the battle that follows between Fei Hung and the bad official is nice. There is still wirework done here but this battle probably had the most REAL and serious MA. Sadly there were many shots that made me realize that Jet was doubled for many of the sequences...sigh...you'll also see Jet try to use the drunken style though unconvincing and some great moves came afterwards and probably is the base of my rating. Some of the moves here are pretty brutal and they stayed in my mind even after the film. Overall I would call this an average movie. OUATIC 1-3 totally outshines this film because there was more meaning to it and I felt more for the characters plus the MA was far better. I can't really recommend you to buy this film but since it is pretty cheap why not. Besides it's part of Jet's Wong Fei Hung history. It's definitely worth checking out so you can make your own opinions. To me this film is trying too hard to be funny and sadly I found myself laughing at scenes in the film that probably weren't intended to be funny. Better Jet films are his original OUATIC 1-3 Fist of Legend (his best) Swordsman II Tai Chi Master Kung Fu Colt Master Shaolin Temple and more...hope this was helpful check out my other MA reviews thanks for reading.

" I'm not sure what movie Amazon thinks this is but it's actually a Wong Fei Hong pic starring Jet Li. And it's not his best either.

" Before reading this review you should know that this film is the same movie as 'Last Hero in China.'This film is as the title of this article proclaims an interesting combination. Combination of what you ask? It is a combination of the Historic Chinese Martial Arts extravaganza and a Tom Green movie. What makes the film interesting is that the combination is not as bad as it sounds. Jet Li once agains plays the role of Wong Fei Hung as he did in the Once Upon A Time in China historical epics but this Fei Hung is a very different character from the more serious Fei Hung (particularly in the first OUATIC) we are used to.In essence this film takes the fairly standard school versus school and style versus style conflict and extends it to a Dragon dancing competition (mirrors of OUATIC here but wait) with Jet Li's masterful Dragon dancing interrupted by a villain in a Millipede suit. Jet Li loses the initial competition due to various circumstances which include the villain's nepharious influence. Jet Li recovers and battles the Millipede in a Chicken Suit in the final battle. Chicken suit? Yes a chicken suit. I told you there was a touch of Tom Green in this movie or is it Adam Sandler? Doesn't matter.Typical of the Jet Li/Wong Jing pairing films this is a less than serious affair. If you go in expecting wonderful wuxia wire-fu and a few laughs in a no budget free for all you will have a great time. Jet Li is an amazing martial artist and somehow this film works. But if you've come looking for Fist of Legend you are in for a serious shock in this film. ",3.0

" Strictly speaking a prequel to a prequel this is the third book in the series. The first 'Hotel Transylvania' took place in mid-1700s France; the second 'The Palace' in late 1400s Italy. This one takes place in the first century of the common era in imperial Rome during the time of Nero and a bit later. There are something over a dozen books in the series all told plus a few spinoffs of books about Olivia Clemens and Madeline two of Saint Germain's lovers who become vampires themselves.The series so far has been quite good; I continue to feel somewhat guilty for not rating the books higher than I do. But there is the continuing stylistic affectation of placing a piece of correspondence after every chapter which I continue to find minorly distracting and there is a scene in this book that seems to be simply out of character as it has been so far defined for the main character. We have been given to understand that many of the traditional legends of the weaknesses of vampires such as the inability to cross running water and the inability to withstand sunlight are conditionally true in the world of Saint Germain; that is to say they are true but can be overcome so long as he stands upon his 'native soil' so he has learned to wear special shoes that are hollow and filled with soil from the land of his birth. Yet in this story when deprived of his special shoes and forced to fight giant crocodiles at midday during a blisteringly hot Roman summer day in the arena (in water) while constantly commenting on how ill and unwell this makes him feel he's still able to function well enough to slay several crocs and survive. (It's not giving away critical plot points to reveal his survival considering that he exists in the previous two books of the series both of which occur historically later than this one). He doesn't as near as I can tell even get a sunburn. This is just so far out of line that I feel the need to dock the book a star just for this one scene; otherwise the book is quite well written.If you are a fan of traditional vampire fiction you may possibly find yourself disappointed with this series; there are many elements generally found in the vampire genre that are missing from these books. But if you like historical romance or even historical fiction in general and don't object to the concept of a heroic vampire protagonist you should find this book and probably most of this series quite enjoyable.

" ***1/2'The Village Barbershop' is a modest unassuming little indie comedy set in the unusual locale of Reno Nevada.Art Leroldi (the wonderful John Ratzenberger) is the cantankerous old-school barber whose business has fallen onto such hard times that he is at risk of losing the establishment that he and his recently deceased partner have run for many years. Against his better judgment he hires a free-spirited young woman (the endearing Shelly Cole) to serve as both his accountant and fellow haircutter at the shop. At first both Art and his conservative customers have a hard time adjusting to this frightening new-world-order of gender equality but through her expertise with the scissors and the force of her personality Gloria eventually manages to win them over to her side.Given this undeniably slight storyline it's obvious that this movie was never going to exactly set the world on fire - but within the admittedly humble parameters that he's set for himself writer/director Chris Ford has succeeded in creating a sweet and amusing regional comedy filled with sparkling performances and generous dollops of local color. Ratzenberger and Cole have charm and likeability to spare and their scenes together are played with understated warmth and humor. Their performances alone compensate for the occasional overindulgence in indie-brand quirkiness and feel-good sentimentality.A minor film but an enjoyable one. ",3.0

" The film about a man who is haunted by the visions he sees. On the surface it appears to be a ghost story but it turns into the exact opposite of that. The movie is very real so expect to see what you would never see in an American film I.E. children dead or murdered. I liked the idea that 'The Uninvited' doesn't sugarcoat or sensor the events that occur. They show you so that you understand just why the characters are so broken when they recall certain events in their lives. By the title of the movie you would think 'The Uninvited' pertains to some sort of entity but really it pertains to a paranormal ability to see and experience things you would rather not.In the fashion of Korean horror this isn't something that you've seen before. The story isn't exactly predictable and problems just don't smooth themselves out. I thought this was a good film. I just assume that the name may confuse people with the American movie which this is NOT! an Asian version of.'The Uninvited' brings its own sense of eeriness that's not your typical haunted ghost story which it may seem like at first. I rated it 3/5 stars because although it's an interesting film it's also a pretty depressing film. The theme of the movie seems to be despair and the only relief from it seems to be death or suicide. The characters seem to have no real resolve to their problems other than to just 'deal with it'. I didn't like the idea so much that even though both of the characters had people around them that cared for them and wanted to help them they still felt so lonely and isolated in their issues.The ending also didn't exactly answer a simple question that I think most people wanted to know about the main character and his fiance. Might seem like it wouldn't be something to be too concerned about but the difference leads to answer another possible question. Like is he going to walk down the same road as the others effected by the paranormal powers.Overall a good film to watch but it's subject matter may not be for the sensitive. I wasn't exactly expecting them to show a child being ran over by a truck either but that's what makes the movie realistic. ",3.0

The movie does refer to the history of the wives by brief scenes that take place in Salt Lake when Brigham Young was the profit. Those scene inform the viewer as to how we came to be where we are today. It's a film-making strategy that in this case works well. Probably because those scenes aren't flashbacks.The movie adds colour to a dour book and illustrates (peoples?) the story with the multiplicity of the wives",3.0

The owner of this car says it was stolen and has an alibi. But did he loan this car to a friend? His insurance covers a stolen car but not one driven by him or an agent. The investigation of the owner reveals some curious facts derived from telephone bills (long distance). This leads to a Mrs. Warfield in New Orleans. A promise of a job brings her to Los Angeles (Chapter VII). This chapter gives an example of proper behavior in a job interview even one designed to investigate the applicant.

" i've been following the underground rap scene for a long time particularly project blowed and spinoffs. i've also been a fan of busdriver since his CVE days. he's always been original witty surreal intelligent and pretty damn FAST. i recently bought the import 'cosmic cleavage' which was brilliant. then i bought this album.wow. busdriver is not a happy man judging from his lyrics. he ranks on the music industry the state of indie rap rap fans(particularly the granola backpacker set he seems to attract) and most of all himself. i gave this album three stars because of its beats but honestly this is one of those un-ratable albums. this is an experiment in self-destruction a cry for help from a man that expects to drown anyways. this is deconstructing everything you or your listening audience ever thought about hiphop. this is busdriver reaching the cul-de-sac of self-referentialism. it's depressing. it's like he gained so much attention but it didn't work out and now he finds himself stuck in a genre of music that he doesn't understand anymore. that said i don't know the man personally so i can't say this is fact but it is definitely what he portray's on this disc. i can't say it is good or bad. it's an artist seeing his own reflection and having serious doubts to its own validity.buy it to support the artist but personally i haven't found it a pleasant listen lyrically. good beats though. mush records and affilliates usually come through on that end. peace.

" It was a good look at this program. It was a well done documentary and I appreciated learning some new things. How many even know about this part of the Samaritan's Purse organization? I'd never heard of it (not that I am an indicator). You can see the sacrifices and challenges that are encountered (as well as the blessings!) of the families that take these three children into their homes while the children wait to have a surgery that they could not have otherwise. The surgeries give them an extension to their lives. The youngest would not have lived for many more years if left untreated. In the process they are also given the opportunity to accept Jesus (the youngest one may not understand at the time). They can go home and share this new relationship with their families also.The documentary isn't something you will be able to `just watch' -it'll give you a case of lump in your throat if you don't just break down and cry. But at the same time there are many instances where you will smile along.This isn't something that I would normally watch and that is why I felt it was 'ok'. There isn't anything 'wrong' with it really.

" I guess agreeing with the 'big time' reviewers isn't something that I can do with this one. Winning the National Book Award is just ridiculous. Were there no other books entered in this category?This is my second Nathaniel Philbrick book (Mayflower - being the first) and I was very disappointed with it. I knew that the author likes to throw his opinion as historical fact but it wasn't as clear in Mayflower as it is in this book. It is obvious that Philbrick is mostly taking a couple of written diaries (as there are only two or three written accounts) and he milks them as much as possible. That would be okay but the constant references to other shipwrecks and disasters that have no bearing on this one bored the snot out of me. Also his constant reminder that the Donner party ate themselves (being chronologically after the time of this book) really should not have been included for any reason.Philbrick took a short story and tried desperately to turn it into a longer one. At that he was successful. The expansion of the thought process of the shipwrecked victims made it sound as if the author talked to them and put down all of their thoughts. Since we know that he did not it was overkill and misplaced in an historical nonfiction book.The number of references to things that had no bearing on the story reminds me of a high school term paper and you need to have 'X' number of references and therefore you make sure that the people reading it know that you had 'X' number of references.It is an interesting story but not very well written.

I would only recommend this book to you if you are interested in the story behind the Essex (which as I said is very well researched and detailed!) and not in the emotions! ",3.0
" This is a gripping chilling interesting true story of the sinking of the Essex whaleship. I think you can spot some thematic material and symbols waiting to be created from this story in a work of fiction. Herman Meliville did and Philbrick's book makes a good pre-reading to 'Moby Dick'.The beginning and the ending I found to be boring and dry. Those sections contain more of the historical backround and afterword.It is a great story of survival and endurance- testing the limits of the human body and psyche. If you liked this book I recommend the book 'Hatchet' which is also a survival story altough a fictional one. In the Heart of the Sea is much like the sea survival stories of 'Jaws' and the 'Perfect Storm' so I don't think there is anything special about this book. ",3.0

But I do have to admit that the way Nathaniel philbrick described the little close nit town was very descriptive. He made it seem like you were looking a photo of it. The book did give me some incite into how it was back then. How life was on the ship not seeing your family for years. After you get through the first couple of chapters the book starts to pick up. It is like you are reliving the whole experience of the sinking of the Essex. I would not recommend this book for animal lovers being one my self reading what they do to the whales and other animals just to survive made me sick. But over all it is a fairly good story. ",3.0

" Nathaniel Philbrick has done an absolutely masterful job digging out the world of the sailors on the Essex on their fateful voyage. The book is filled with detail of the day-to-day travails of the seaman & officers and interesting speculation about the relationships between major players in the drama. The book would be of particular interest to people intoxicated with the sea & sailing since there is plenty of information about how sailing & navigation was done (right & wrong by this group) in the early nineteenth century. Where I found the book to be weak is in the general history the context in which all this occurred. I prefer a book that uses an incident like this as a centerpiece to elucidate the social political economic cultural situation of the day. Philbrick does this in places particularly in the first few chapters but then the book degenerates or better said narrows its view to the Essex voyage itself abandoning the historical context. The book would have been much much longer & less focused had it taken the approach I suggest ... but it is nevertheless the approach I prefer. That is why I gave it a 3. ",3.0
" This is not a bad book but it is weighed down a bit by the numerous facts. It is good to know that it was researched entensively before being written but a little too much left in the book.

" I can't quite put my finger on it but it strikes me that there's a certain strain of superfluousness in the contemporary narrative nonfiction genre. I get the vague sense that there are all too many books coming out that are merely reheating slices of history that have been well documented but in a way that makes them more digestible to the modern reader. This National Book Award winner is a perfect example. The 'Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex' isn't exactly obscure -- Herman Melville drew upon it forMoby Dick two accounts by survivors of the actual events exist and Thomas Hefferman'sStove by a Whale",3.0
" As Nathaniel Philbrick freely admits history is replete with tales of shipwrecked castaways - and planewrecked rugger teams - eating each other. And the Essex was not the only whale boat to sink nor even was it the only one to get rammed by a whale. Nor is N. Philbrick the only man to have written about this particular ship",3.0

" First let me say I am a big fan of survival against all odds types of books. I have read and loved Alive Forever on the Mountain In Harms Way etc. This would not rank up to those standards in my opinion. Of course those three books I mentioned had a big advantage - actual survivors for the author to interview. This event took place in 1820 so the author had less to go on. All that being said if you are a fan of survival books this is worthwhile. A 3 out 5 sounds right on. ",3.0
" Much has been written (and now shown on national TV) about Philbrick's 'In the Heart of the Sea'. This short (less than 300 page) historical account of the whaleship Essex will quickly send those who are fans of the genre back to the Andes Mountains of the early 1970s in 'Alive' and the New England coastline where the hearty seamen from 'The Perfect Storm' met their fate. What separates Philbrick's writing (and ultimately makes the book interesting) is the often graphic and well-researched accounting of 1820s Nantucket and the brutal lives of the whalers who made a living by going off to sea for nearly 2 years at a time. I cannot rate the book higher only because while the storyline is compelling I did not find the story of such a unique character as to separate it from other books that deal with brutal human hardships. ",3.0
" This is the tragedy of the whaleship Essex. The same tragedy that inspired Herman Melville's very famous novel Moby Dick. Philbrick's In the Heart of the Sea situates the tale of the Essex in the history of Nantucket during the 1800s. Philbrick draws on the journals and personal testimonies of the survivors local newspapers etc. to recreate an event that had an enormous impact on American history and especially Nantucket history.The Essex set sail in 1819 to hunt sperm whales which were the most oil rich whales in the ocean. The sperm whale gets its name from the stores of clear oil located in its head which turns cloudy white when exposed to air; this oil burned clearer and brighter than any other whale oil and was in high demand. These whales could provide hundreds of gallons of oil and one successful whaling expedition could make captains and investors incredibly wealthy.About 3000 miles off the coast of South America the Essex is attacked and sunk by a vengeful sperm whale that looks to be about 80+ feet in length (double the size of the average male). In three small whale boats the 20-man crew embarks on a legendary adventure. For 93 days they are stranded facing starvation dehydration and mental deterioration.The unspeakable things that happened during those 93 days are revealed through Philbrick's assessment of the history and the literature. He unveils not only the circumstances that would lead men to cannibalism but also the circumstances that would lead men to temporarily abandon their morals and political and religious affiliations. For example in the face of starvation they sacrifice a black sailor. This sailor is the first person to be killed for food; despite their abolitionist roots the Nantucketers opt to save their fellow white sailors.Philbrick also focuses on the families of the sailors who stay behind on Nantucket as their husbands brothers fathers and sons embark on two-year expeditions. Wives see their husbands for a few months at a time only to be left for years on end. Children grow to ages two and three before they even meet their fathers.Overall the book is a fascinating history of the lives of whalers their families and their native Nantucket. The history about the island has me itching to visit! My only complaint is that the book is a little dry and the numerous quotes and embedded quotes make for slow going. I've read two books while reading this one!P.S. I've never seen the word 'sperm' so man times in my life. ",3.0
" The author of this book surely has a lot of experience with veneering but in my opinion there are better ways to do things than some of the ways he suggests. For instance he uses regular wood glue (PVA) to apply veneer by letting it dry and then using an iron to reactivate the glue. I would never trust this to hold over the long run and PVA glue is not the best kind of glue to use with veneer anyway. It is to thin and it doesn't dry to a hard glue line so it will allow the veneer to creep with seasonal changes in humidity. He also never mentions using a vacuum press. While a press might not be for beginners it is the easiest best way to veneer a flat or curved panel. ",3.0
" Some parts of this book are very educational and others so bad they are weird.As a previous reviewer notes the author's approach to vacuum pressing is to make his bag by gluing and taping two thin plastic sheets together making a bundle of more plastic sheeting around a [garden?] hose to make the connection valve and then connecting the hose to a wooden block covering the intake port on his air compressor (Don't try this at home; constricting the intake port on many piston driven compressors can screw up the valves). He reports that 'real' vacuum presses are expensive and he finds vacuum pressing not terribly effective...If you've never veneer vacuum pressed before you might not recognize that as the hominid precursor approach. I'm surprised he shows use of a veneer hammer instead of the more cost effective stone club method. For a lot of (better) info on vacuum pressing google up the Joewoodworker website.As others have noted some of his approaches to glue preparation are a bit odd as well. Coating with thinned wood glue and then ironing to heat activate... I suppose you could do it that way I'm just at a loss as to why you would want to. There are several other approaches and glues that bond better are less mess to handle and generally produce better results. 'Course if you bought a load of past its prime Tite-Bond at discount I guess it would make sense (and be consistent with his vacuum press).Some good stuff some just flat out weird.

The Series3 was not able to connect to establish the wireless connection. I did follow the troubleshooting steps that came with the adaptor but I think it is possible that the adaptor was too close to the wireless router. In other words the adaptor might have worked just fine if I had the TiVo Series3 box further away from the wirelss router. Since I had a hardline available on the wireless router I plugged the Series3 into the router directly using CAT5 cable and the Series3 connected with no trouble after that. I'm not guessing about the adaptor being too close to the wireless router; in another wireless setup I read that the wireless device might not receive the wireless signal if it was too close to the wirelss router.

There are many good 802.11g USB network adapters available on the market at affordable prices but you'll find the TiVo series 2 DVR is not compatible with most of them. I really think TiVO should update the network technology of their box. They're way behind. I settled on the TiVo Wireless G USB network adapter because it was one of the few that works perfectly with my TiVo but it does not support security features that I really wish it did support. For example the only wireless security it supports is WEP encryption. It does not support WPA at all. And by the way if you decide to use WEP encryption make sure you use a Hex key not an ASCII key. When I tried to set it up using a 128-bit ASCII key it would not connect to the wireless network at all.

I was hoping to get better reception but after plugging this adapter to my TiVo Series 3 the signal strength went down from 'Very Good' on the linksys B to 'Good' and sometimes 'Marginal' with the TiVo G. I was a little disappointed to see that this pricey adapter has a weaker antenna than my 5 year old B adapter. I'm typing this review from my laptop next to the adapter which is currently getting excellent signal strength.

I did not have the problem one other reviewer had our tubes were inserted thank God. The 'squeals with delight' is out and out false advertising. The other reviewer was correct... it's a dog squeak toy sound. Really a company of Zapf's caliber should know better. I think people who purchased this doll should be given a rebate. Anyone interested in sending a petition to Zapf and Amazon regarding this blatent lie regarding this product? I should have guessed no batteries would indicate no real sound functions but I've seen Zapf pull off some great features with dolls in the past and thought because of the eyes there had to be some gimic with this doll as well. One additional complaint regarding this doll... the clothes are astronomically expensive to buy (real baby clothes are cheaper!) and yet the outfit the doll comes with is poorly made and not that nice looking guilting parents into the purchase of at least one decent outfit for the doll. My solution... do a web search there are free sewing patterns out there for doll clothes that will fit this doll. Shame on whoever claimed this doll 'squeals with delight'. ",3.0
" This album is misleading because it's just Ponty's best from 1987 - 1991. I much prefer his material from 1975 - 85 in which he focused on the violin and not the electronics he's dabbling with these days. But because this is the best of three studio albums it makes for a fairly strong regular release and saves you from the crap. I enjoyed this more than I thought. Grover Washington is on one track and the final song is a wonderful piece by Chopin. But the bottom line is if you ever purchase a Ponty album make sure it's on Atlantic Records not Epic unless you have all the Atlantic albums. ",3.0
" First take this CD for what it's worth not by the standards set before and after it. So it's not '461' or 'Slowhand.' That's not necessarily a bad thing. Like Neil Young. Clapton didn't always put out albums for their top 40 value. On the contrary. Particularly at this point in his career Clapton had earned some license- for better or worse depending on who you ask- to do some things he wanted to do and let the Billboard charts be danged. Yet despite that he could still spit out songs that garnered radio play like 'Carnival' and 'Hello Old Friend' two of my favorite Clapton songs. Also like Young as well as Dylan Clapton was partial to using one of the several lush sporadically used female background singers of the time. In this case that voice is Marcy Levy who if her voice were absent from the song 'Beautiful Thing' it wouldn't be as smooth or melodic. In fact Clapton was so comfortable with his stature at this point in his career that he allowed Levy to sing solo in the song 'Innocent Times' as he played in the background to churn out what is in my opinion the best song on this CD. It's a real Levy tour de force albeit a brief one. For that reason itself this CD's worth buying. And while 'Sign Language' is hardly the best collaboration between 2 star recording artists it's actually a decent song consistent with this CD's tone and unmistakenly Clapton and Dylan. But also typical of albums/CDs of this time they weren't chock full of hits from beginning to end. So what makes this CD or even this era different from that of today? With rare exceptions many big name artists have CDs that contain some grizzle. Future Clapton CDs would have slicker production quality particularly after Phil Collins produced CDs put Clapton's name back in the spotlight in the early 80s. After that Clapton became something of an video darling but did that necessarily mean he produced better songs? Purely subjective. Try this CD. I challenge you to not find some appeal in it. I bet you find yourself humming at least a couple of the tunes. I dare you to admit you didn't find your toe tapping to a couple tunes. And I especially bet you find yourself wondering what else did Marcy Levy record worth listening to. I know I did. ",3.0
" 'No Reason To Cry' is in my opinion one of Claptons weakest albums next to 'Another Ticket'. The whole thing is a sloppy mess with weakdisjointed playing no cohesion or direction and much slurring from Eric on lead vocals. Where are the producers on this album? I wonder sounds like they were 'out to lunch' on most of it or maybe flat on their backs on the floor! However Marcy Levy wrote and performed well on the track 'Innocent Times'. Rick Danko Richard Manuel Bob Dylan Georgie Fame and Ron Wood make guest appearances that don't really add much of anything to the entire mess. To be fair There are a couple of OK tracks such as 'Beautiful Thing' 'Carnival' 'Hello Old Friend' and the Bob Dylan penned 'Sign Language'. His filler blues cover 'Double Trouble'and Rick Danko song 'All Our Past Times'(Both songs are covered much better in Clapton's live 1980 album 'Just One Night'.) are very good. In 'All Our Past Times' there are the follwing lyrics 'All our past times should be forgotten All our past times should be erased.' makes me think so should the master tapes of this 1976 half effort.

" 'No Reason to Cry' is one of Eric Clapton's lesser orginial studio albums. The problem is in the material which is simply not up to the incredibly high standards of Clapton 1970s masterpieces such as '461 Ocean Blvd.' and 'Slowhand.' That's not to say the album is awful. In fact there is hardly a bad song in the mix. It just doesn't live up to expectations. For example the Clapton-Bob Dylan collaboration on the song 'Sign Language' is pleasant enough but is not the masterpiece you would expect from these two music giants.Overall 'No Reason to Cry' should be primarily of interest to Clapton's ardent fans. Casual listeners should start with one of the two albums listed above or one of his anthology albums instead. ",3.0
" I'm a git player over 35 years and love EC. This release on his comeback trail in '76 is not much to get happy about. Reports circulated at the time of these recording sessions had found EC drinking very hard and surrounded by the same type of musicans involved. Ex Herion addicts usually go to Alcohol to relieve the JUNK pain from Herion. It is no reason that this release fell on deaf ears when first issued. EC's playing is stiff and mediocre. Even the bonus track added on the CD 'LAST NIGHT' does not leave you filled or do any justice. He is stiff on all his git work on this album. A shame. Maybe I'm just to critical but others felt the same way. judging by the cover of EC in a bar with bottles of liquor in front of him answers these downer gaps. ",3.0

" As a ShoDan assistant instructor of Shiho Karano Kenpo Karate I strive to educate myself about the martial arts. I've found some good books on the subject and I'm always on the lookout for more. Since 'The Karate Dojo' has been in print since 1967 I figured it must provide valuable direction. It does mainly by portraying a snapshot of martial arts history that challenges the budo practitioner to forsake mediocrity for mastery and character.The book has three basic parts. First the author provides a somewhat Karate-centric view of martial arts facets such as the dojo belt ranking systems and character self-analysis. In the second section are a number of martial arts parables that teach through historical narrative. Finally Sensei Urban uses the last chapter to discuss the 'contemporary' Karate scene (i.e. the mid-1960s). The overall theme is one of extreme discipline and perseverance within the martial arts necessary to achieve a seemingly mystical level of physical mental moral and spiritual ability. In other words it takes hard work and commitment to become a 'weaponless weapon.''The Karate Dojo' is a quick read - I finished it in less than a day. There are a number of stylized line drawings and black-and-white photographs to complement the text. It's a portrait of an era in Karate that seems to be almost mythical - and mostly lost at least in the West. The author fondly discusses harsh daily training under the strict discipline of a revered master in a dojo where everyone's practically family. I've tasted some of that but nothing close to what Sensei Urban describes. And that's where I differed with the author. Yes optimal mastery of any activity requires the type of commitment he advocates and that's OK for some. But I believe it's possible to benefit from a consistent and disciplined practice of the martial arts without making an all-consuming religion out of it.At any rate despite some dated aspects and a monkish focus on martial arts that may be beyond what many would bear 'The Karate Dojo' contains worthwhile insights for the martial artist. If nothing else its high standards may challenge one to take their current commitment and practice to a higher level. ",3.0

" This book though poorly written has a story to tell though it could have been better told by someone who knows how to write. It is however an easy quick read and moderately interesting. It does have some merit in as much as it chronicles the author's ascent of Denali.Most of the book is spent recounting the time during which she and her team mates were trapped on Denali at 14000 feet caught in one of the most severe storms on record which saw eleven people perish. Her description of the horrendous weather conditions and sub zero temperatures which pinned her team down for a period of about two weeks is graphic though repetitious. She was lucky to have been with two experienced guides who knew what they were doing. This is undoubtedly one of the main reasons she and her team mates survived their ordeal.Disconcerting are her repeated racist references to Asian climbers. Her comments are unworthy and make her sound ignorant. It cannot help but affect one's opinion of her and that opinion is unflattering.

Well being someone that is over weight and has a problem with determining what an actual serving is poses a HUGE problem.

Perhaps George Washington L'Enfant and the early capital architects were into astrology I don't know. Perhaps the sign Virgo has some supernatural significance for the well being of the capital and the country I don't know.

The book moves slowly the author did his research and I have no quibble with that - I know this topic; however the significance of why the Freemasons chose to do things that have been done in the manner that they did is just not revealed I was really disappointed because there is some terrific information out there and I am well versed in this topic based on my own research. I am wondering if this is because he wasn't allowed to 'get to the point' no pun intended. I think the true reason he left out answers to why (Astrology is important but he didn't say why among other points never addressed is because Mason's aren't allowed to share the key precepts of their faith or beliefs to the uninitiated - that leaves out all females and many men.There are many good books out there to understand the significance of Masonry -you won't find them by doing an internet search using the word - avoid the publications that will come up will give you books written by Masons (who often don't share that information up front) these books reveal much of the same stuff rehashed instead try books by William Schnoebelen John Ankerberg David Weldon Tom C.

" Ever wonder why the city of Washington D.C. was an explicitly designed city but the streets are laid out in a seemingly illogical manner? Wouldn't you design a simple grid pattern for a city instead of the bizarre pattern found there?David Ovason attempt to give meaning to this street pattern and for some of the architecture found in the city. His analysis is brilliant but I find myself wandering in the sometimes meandering pattern of his investigation just like the layout of the city. It would probably help for the reader to have a background in astrology/astronomy to give greater meaning to this analysis for I often found myself scratching my head.It was interesting to learn that Pierre L'Enfant the French Freemason given credit for the design of the city was later sacked from the construction team for criticism of some of the builders for messing up his design. He would later go broke wander around the city and pester congress for a greater share of payments that he thought were his for the design of the city. He died broke and is buried near Arlington House. ",3.0
" As one who works in the Capitol I was intrigued by the title. I bought this book many years ago and recently got around to finishing it. David Ovason is a well-educated man and has written a very thought provoking book.He sets out to prove that Washington D.C. was designed and built largely by Masonic architects. And this is true. But he gives many facts and footnotes to support this.It is a well-known fact that Benjamin Franklin was a Mason along with architect James Hoban (who designed the White House) Presidents Garfield and Polk and Statue of Liberty sculptor Frederic Bartholdi.And although textbooks teach that the federal city was the brainchild of French engineer Pierre-Charles L'Enfant Ovason argues that Washington Jefferson U.S. Surveyor General Andrew Ellicott and others modified L'Enfant's original blueprint. I think the author makes a great case but I got lost several times because I could not keep up with it all. Many facts here!Masonic symbolism appears in the marble plaster concrete glass and paint facades of the Federal Reserve the Library of Congress and other landmarks. This book the result of a decade of thought and research establishes the plausibility of Ovason's theory. I appreciated the time that went into it.This work looks at the Capitol the Washington Monument city planning and the numerous zodiacs located throughout the city.

" As a countertenor I am always searching for recordings from new and up and coming singers. I had heard some wonderful things about this album and decided to buy it. It was very interesting to hear 11 differnet versions of the famous Ave Maria Text and I believe that the contrast and pacing of the album is excellent. My sole fault lies in the vocal production of this young singer. MOST of his range is sheer and glittering. He has a lovely tone and clean projection and resonance. Like many countertenors the sound at the bottom of the range takes on a rather covered sound at times but this is characteristic of the voice and is not terribly distracting most of the time. In matters of vibrato everyones taste varies but there are moments when the vibrato is a bit wider and unstylistic than might be generally appropriate. Unfortunately like many singers with rare voice types who feel the need to 'prove' themselves to an often difficult public he decided on several occasions to pass the tessitura at which his voice sounds natural and unforced. I can sing to a soprano Db but I would never do so in public performance or on a recording because I can acknowledge that there are parts of my voice that are better left in the rehearsal studio and left OUT of the recording studio. All in all this is NOT a BAD album. The material is rich and interestingly arranged by the production team and nearly of the vocals are clean and pleasant. Just beware of the top notes when the range is more suited to Dramatic Soprano than for Lyric Countertenor. ",3.0

" In the age of overdeterming macroeconomic factors ETFs high frequency trading hedge funds etc. technical analysis is a total waste of time for the average Joe sitting at his workstation trying to day trade. For every chart that shows a meaningful pattern there are 5 that show no pattern at all. The technician out of necessity of his methodology is forced to make meaning of a chart which is likely just a random collection of observations. Just because a price happened to bottom or top twice consecutively at the same point doesn't mean that there's 'support' or 'resistance' at that level. Sometimes there are legitimate support and resistance levels but more often than not those are illusory. Support or resistance levels evaporate and reset all the time.Fundamental analysis puts the investor in a much better position to actually succeed in my opinion. Earnings price book value growth forward earnings debt levels etc. are not subject to any interpretation. They are what they are. It might take any given stock a long time for it to align w/ its fundamental valuation but the relative predictability that one sees in P/E levels for different types of businesses of varying sizes and growh prospects makes the fundamental school the more rational approach.Also anyone who believes that markets are 'efficient' hasn't paid much attention to markets.

" There is an old adage that two are better than one. But not according to Lydia Sanderson a stiff and awkward pioneer woman of the 1890's who left Pennsylvania after her husband died to make a stake in northeast Oregon country and the Blue Mountains. Fiercely independent and willing to face the hardships of living alone on a remote mountainside this story by Molly Gloss is based on original journals of the time and painstakingly accurate in its details of the area.The theme--women can be independent and do it as well or better than men--is a popular one in these modern times though its spin gives me pause. Was this really so strongly portrayed in those days? To the author's credit however she did at times give a hint of Lydia's loneliness. 'I shall not see Evelyn Walker now nor any other woman until the Spring and must harden my heart not to be Lonely.'Gloss's plain and homespun style of writing wove a pleasing tale. It made me want to unravel her story until the end. She has a rare ability to detail the mundane while twining together different story lines in a unique way. Her realism made me believe she knew her setting well--albeit often painting it in shades of gray with words like dull and sooty. (I live in these mountains. When it came to her descriptions of the weather and the poverty of the times she nailed it!)In the end however I was left unsatisfied feeling a certain hopelessness and fatalism. I found myself wishing Lydia Sanderson would indeed find that soul mate even pathetic Tim Whiteaker her male suitor who could at least make her life somewhat easier.

" Pirates of the Caribbean At World's End is without a doubt the best looking Pirate game I have ever seen! And so it is to my utmost disappointment that the gameplay does not make use of such outstanding artwork. This 'T' for Teen rated game follows the movie plot of Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest and the newly released Pirates of the Caribbean At World's End. The game takes players to many of the locations found in the two movies such as Port Royal Tortuga Isla Cruces Singapore Davy Jones' Locker and of course the Black Pearl and the Flying Dutchman. Unfortunately little to no room is given to explore or interact with these magnificent looking environments. Instead the game sends the player from one un-imaginative fight into the next while collecting random objects for extra rewards along the way. Some jumping and balancing sections try to mix things up but even these activities quickly become repetitive. Pirates requires absolutely no thinking because only one objective can be completed at a time and only one predefined path can be taken. The game offers two different Multiplayer games where players can duel each other in a sword fight or battle in splitscreen mode with or against each other to defeat enemies. Overall Pirates of the Caribbean At World's End is (another) mediocre movie tie-in action game. Leaving a lot of potential but no follow through. ",3.0
" This product is a double negative. It's so bad it's good. That might seem strange but I'll explain why in a minute.This video games retells the events in the last two Pirates of the Caribbean movies. However if you're serious about the story skip this. This video game doesn't retell the story very accuratly. Only half of the plot details happened in the movie.As for graphics I agree with the other reviewers. The animation is not glitchy and looks very nice. However Jack Sparrow's peculiar movements looked more entertaining in the movie. In this game Jack Sparrow looks over animated; like he's too drunk to stand up (but miraculously talk straight). Other than that nice graphics. For a game developed for a fast release it certainly looks pretty.Now we get to the big question. Gameplay... The gameplay is seriously boring. Serious video gamers will be un-entertained and would rather play Halo. However people who have had bad days will love this game. If you want a game that is easy to play and win you can play this. If you've overworked your brain in the office you can come home and let this game play itself for you. This game is a stress reliever.If you're a serious video gamer than done bother renting this. However if you do get a copy save it for a very miserable day. ",3.0
" I bought this game on xbox 360 because I had a lot of fun playing it with my sister on wii. It is not the same. I found it was difficult and boring. The graphics are better on 360 and that was kind of cool but I am not even sure if its the same storyline. I know for sure there are things in the xbox version I never saw on the wii (and vis versa). I recommend renting this first to see if its your kind of thing or not. Don't waste the money without trying it out. ",3.0
" Pirates of Carribean is a moderatly fun game with richly detailed graphics in third person viewpoint. The weak part about the game is the combat. The attacks performed by your character (J.Sparrow) J.Depp and later on in tandem with Orlando Blooms Character are pretty simple button mash combo sequence. You can press A for sword attack and X for punch attack .Also after filling up a portion of your finish meter you can perform a finishing kill by pressing the buttons that will flash on the screen to do a finish move you will see a prompt on screen telling you which button to press in sequence to perform a finish kill. Which always starts as Hold LT then the press or hold the corisponding button prompted on screen. Like this for example Hold LT. then press Y hold B. Or sometimes just hold Y . Whatever is on the screen ..very simular to Spiderman-3 button mashing cutscenes. The only problem with this is its way too easy to just kill an enemy by just pressing A (sword slash) over and over too kill about 90% of the enemies. While the other 10% require at least one finish kill to eliminate them. You also have a handgun with (get this) 3 bullets.woo hoo!! So authentic to that era..lol.you can kill an enemy with your eyes closed because of the auto-aim hold LT. ... The A.I. is horribly easy to kill. One time I tested out to see if an enemy would hit me at all. And he just stood there circling me without even hitting me or even trying anything at all and I was right in front of him finally I just pressed A three times and he was dead Lame very Lame. And these same enemies repeat themselves over and over with some of them waiting there turn too fight me. Anybody who played ERAGON? well its nearly the same here in this game. With Pirates only being slightly less lame....Another combat form is when you meet a boss type character you go into 'DUEL' mode . The camera switches into side scroll mode simular to Mortal Combat. But thats where the comparison ends . There's 3 Circles on the left or right of the combatant . One being a high attack oNe representing a mid attack and one representing a low attack. Now get this when the circle turns grey its telling you in advance how the fighter is going to attack you so you can successfully block the attack (how polite) so if you see the upper circle turn grey you push left stick up. And if you make a successful block it will turn green .Or red if you dont. Well this feature takes away the fun out of it as your constantly looking at the 3 circles more than the fighters. Which makes it unbeliveable lame . Its nothing like Soul Caliber or a Mortal Combat at all. There are some great features about this game which are the graphics are pretty darn good. Some of the towns reminded me of Oblivion. And there are some great fog and lighting effects. And the cutscenes look quite good.The levels are pretty much straight forward linear with a little back-tracking here and there. There are some puzzly type things like you play an organ in a certain sequence to get Davy Jones's key. Its pretty much kindergarden-1st grade puzzles. Kids up too 13 will probably LOVE this game as the combat is very Eragon-ish. But at least the camera is fully controlable so there's no fighting characters off screen. The only side scroll is the easy as pie boss 'duels' . Johnny Depp character looks incredibly good . As well as the squid guy and the hammer head guy . The graphics are a very strong point in this game.Another nice thing is you can switch between Jack Sparrow and Orlando Bloom in combat and control both fighters. Another nice thing is the soul trap sword its a flaming green sword that traps enemies souls for whatever eason other than achievement points and high scores postings on LIVE . I hope there is a cheat soon where I could play the entire game with a flaming sword because it only lasts for a short period and to recharge it you have to find and collect mummified heads. Also you can climb certain wallsropesladdersships masts when prompted too which is pretty nice. It is a somewhat decent game in the adventure part but the easy as pie enemies will have hardcore gamers wishing for more but the kiddes will love this game. Would I buy it? Nope. Only if I had young kids. ",3.0

" The authors have done reasonably well in presenting general design/architecture issues in the area of object relational database management systems.Poor editing however abounds in this book. The reader must wade through paragraphs of opinionated comments distracting (and often incorrect) pontifications and complaints. For example hardware designers are roundly chastized for failing to support Multics-style protection-ring logic in today's microprocessors.The text is heavily sprikled with superlatives such as 'explosive' 'incredible' 'astonishing' etc. It is irritating from a reader's perspective to be digging out good technical material betweeen snippets of pro-Informix marketing hype.When not engaged in hype the authors sometimes make curious and possibly false assertions. In one instance they claim that Wal-Mart's huge data warehouse is utilized to 'rotate stock'.

" I am reviewing the 1st edition.Dr. Stonebraker is a pioneer in the field of object-relational database management systems (ORDBMS). He writes with confidence and clarity; he knows the subject matter because he was one of the early innovators. The book is mercifully short and to-the-point. It is well organized and it includes an index references short code samples and plenty of diagrams.The book assumes you have some background and experience with existing relational database management systems and SQL. It would also help if you have some basic understanding of implementation details like B-tree indexes and cost-based query optimizers. You should also have an understanding of OO concepts like inheritance and polymorphism and some experience with an OO language like C++ Eiffel Java or Smalltalk.Armed with this background the book is an excellent overview of the motivation architecture design and features of ORDBMS. I especially liked the chapters on SQL parsing and query optimization and also the discussions of how inheritance affects query and trigger processing.If you've never been exposed to the ideas and concepts of 'object-relational' this is an excellent starting point. If you have the background described above you will be able to read this book in a few sittings and come away with a basic - albeit incomplete - understanding of the field of ORDBMS.I say 'incomplete' because Dr. Stonebraker fails to write about the dark side of ORDBMS. For example once pointer-like references are introduced the system runs the risk of 'dangling pointers'- precisely the kind thing a purely relational system elegantly avoids. This issue is never once mentioned and yet I know for a fact it is a danger that must be dealt with on one commercial implementation I have used. There are other issues to be confronted and understood. C.J. Date has written extensively on the subject. Although C.J. Date's writing is sometimes long-winded and pedantic you won't truly understand the ORDBMS topic until you've read what he has to say.The book is also a compelling marketing promotion for the product once sold by Stonebraker's now-defunct company. Given the 'feature matrices' and other comparisons in the text it is clear that his product was the hands-down winner at the time the book was written. This is all ancient history however. The book shows its age and bias. First of all Stonebraker's company Illustra (later renamed Informix) was recently acquired by IBM. Secondly very little is said about Oracle which has since implemented a very respectable OR system of its own. Lastly most of the other vendors he mentioned have fallen completely off the radar map. These days all the database vendors have most of their attention turned towards XML and raw OLTP throughput. So it seems like 'The Next Great Wave' predicted by Stonebraker never fully materialized. Perhaps the 2nd edition of the book has updated the vendor list and features matrices.I wish more was said about his early work on the 'POSTGRES' system. If you're interested you can find out much more about POSTGRES and its open-source offspring PostgresSql by using any Internet query engine. There is now a whole cottage publishing industry built up around PostgresSql. If you want to experiment and explore ORDBMS PostgresSql may be a good choice.Based on what I can see in the table of contents the 2nd edition doesn't include too much new material. Dr. Stonebraker has added a chapter on application servers. I know from his other work that he argues that middle-tier application servers are wrong-headed because business logic should reside in the database itself - where it is physically close to the data.I rate the 1st edition of the book 3 stars because (1) It is dated (2) No space is allotted to the problematic issues of ORDBMS (3) 'The Next Great Wave' never seemed to take off as predicted.Nevertheless it is a worthwhile and useful book to read if you are interested in the topic. The 2nd edition will surely have an up-to-date comparison of the ORDBMS vendors as of 1999. ",3.0
" While the first and third books in the trilogy are good exposure to the Halo Universe the second is an almost complete failure as a novel. It does have its few redeemable qualities but any 'scene' featuring the Master Chief or an event in the game feels mostly forced. It's like the author played the game through on easy recorded what he did and fleshed it out to make the central plot line. Pretty much every part that the author had to come up with on his own is good but when considered as part of the whole it's just.... Not good fiction.The other two books are good in their own ways.I would suggest purchasing the books if you're interested in Halo. ",3.0
" All three of the stories were written well and the plots unfolded in riviting fashion as one who had played the game would expect. However with that said I must state that one of my primary expectations weren't met or even addressed.At the end of the first Halo game we see 343 Guilty Spark tooling through space apparently unharmed from the final cataclysm that befell Halo. We also were left with the impression from various pieces of dialog through the game that like Neo (Matrix) the Master Chief (Reclaimer) had been down this road before.While I hadn't expected the prequel The Fall of Reach to provide much in terms of explanation of these open items I did have full expectations that these items would be either more fully developed or even explained in the sequel First Strike. Disappointingly none of the open items from the first Halo were discussed.It would have been appreciated if the Amazon Review had made mention of this crtical ommission beforehand. I might well have still purchased the Trilogy but now I feel a bit cheated. ",3.0

" This album was the first I heard from Sparta. The songs are each powerful in their own respect and Sparta truly has a sound of their own. They touch on the emo/screamo genre often but are not afraid to branch out and try some off the wall stuff. However I found the songs to be redundant and often repetitive this record does grow on you though. Favorites of mine include 'End Moraine' 'Splinters' and 'Lines in Sand'. I would also like to say that I prefer Sparta over Mars Volta. ",3.0
" I would have given this record three and a half stars but amazon won't let me. Ok so when i first picked this up it didn't really do too much for me. I mean it sounded like Sparta but was no where near as varied or experimental as Wiretap Scars. I kinda left it for a few days after only giving it about 2 listens. For some odd reason i felt like giving it another chance to sweep me away. And that it finally did. It takes a bit of getting used to but sparta has made a cohesive album of gut-wrenching powerful and emotional songs. You can definately tell these guys are giving it all they've got and thats what really counts. I've been listening to this record nonstop now for last 3 days and its quickly becoming one of my personal favourites. I find though that its better not to compare it to Wiretap Scars because then you would be missing the point. I beleive Sparta is continually trying to re-invent themselves and releasing another record of the same material would not do this. Porcelain is an alotgether beautiful and emotionally charged record that will definately take you on a ride as long as you're willing to let it. ",3.0
" My friend bought the album. I listened to it today at work. It was .. bland.Coming from Sparta I was surprised. There were a few good parts. The opening song itself led me to high hopes and 'Lines in the Sand' is also impressive and different. However I give this album 3 stars for a few reasons.One the album itself looks like it was made to be returned. The font used for the album cover is reminiscent of something that would be found on an N'sync album. Okay I can overlook that. The artwork however .. what artwork is there? Just whiteness with pictures of the band members. Okay I can overlook that too right?I read the lyrics. They aren't impressive at all. Basic words in their expected orders. This is where I began to frown upon the album. However I kept a tad bit of hope.Then I stuck the cd in my player. Within about 6 songs or so I was done. I had heard it before. It was the normal thing. A few good guitar patterns here or there something experimental every now and then. But overall it was just .. normal. The only thing that seemed to give the album an edge was the vocals. That and a few very nice moves in the structuring of the songs.Other than that not much impressed me. ",3.0

Wiretap overpowers this release. Just my opinion. ",3.0

" When I saw the video for 'Stick 'Em Up' I was taken in by the song's catchiness as well as the fact that the video features the lead rapper in a boxing match! So I went out and bought the CD not knowing whether or not the risk was worth it...Well I've listened to the CD a few times already and all I can say is that if you like the Beastie Boys and Rage Against The Machine then you'll love Quarashi. However the Icelandic foursome doesn't quite match up to the aforementioned bands if you know what I mean. The Beasties had developed wit and cleverness in their lyrics and music while Rage had an intense passion and focus in their music. Quarashi could use some improvement in their lyrics and sound. Like I said before it's not all that bad but their music and lyrics come across as slightly corny and juvenile at times (i.e. 'Your mother is a stripper' or 'I come on the mic like a fascist' (or something like that)? Please!) Still I definitely see potential in this band and I believe they can be a much better band given time. After all it's only their debut album. Heck look at the Beastie Boys. They've definitely come a long way since 'Licensed To Ill'! ",3.0
" Being a fan of rap/rock you have to imagine my reaction to Quarashi when I first heard them... There aren't enough mainstream rap/rock bands out there so every time I hear a new band like this I look at it as a rare indulgance. First off the first song I heard was Mr. Jinx and I was unimpressed by the facts that the hook was the only thing pulling the song together and the weak lyrics weren't helping. It was recently while playing a game for PS2 called Amplitude that I heard the song Baseline and I really enjoyed it.While doing some research on the band I was upset to find that the band consisted of four regulars three rappers and a drummer who sometimes used a drum machine. In all honestly a lot of the songs on this CD aren't bad but I've yet to find anything other than Baseline and Stick Em' Up really extroadinary. Don't get me wrong these guys are pioneering what's left to be explored of rap/rock but by doing so they're trying out a lot of things that really don't work that well and to make things worse the variety makes for a painful album because there's nothing you can really get into without hewaring something different a little later.So I've made it clear that Quarashi is no Rage but some of their songs are worth listening to. These guys still need to find their niche and for christsakes learn how to play their own instruments. ",3.0

" Even though I read 30-odd pages of Communion before coming to the conclusion that it was just a little to far-fetched I thought I'd see what the movie had to offer. Well to be quite honest it did nothing to convince me that my initial conclusion from the book is unjustified. Are we seriously supposed to believe that aliens who apparently have the ability to visit our planet from great distances have such impracticle body structures and that they've come all this way simply to[...] probe Earthlings? I'm by no means a sceptic when it comes to this topic and am willing to give anyone the benefit of the doubt so long as their story isn't completely absurd--which is the case with Communion.The DVD contains a very short clip of the surgical removal of a supposed alien implant from some guy's arm. This may sound sensational but it most certainly is not. Not surprsingly we are not allowed a close-in look at this 'alien implant' and no less surprising the clip ends with a statement to the effect that the nature of the 'device' has yet to be determined. And I'm sure that it has since been 'mysteriously' lost so we'll never know what it was. Isn't that just always the case? ",3.0

" The movie'Communion'which is based on a contoversial New York Times bestseller by the same name is in no respects as convincing as the novel written by author Whitley Strieber. Strieber's novel and movie both tell the 'true' story of his personal encounters with apparent aliens which Strieber has coined the term 'visitors' when refering to them. The movie lacks in several departments. One obviously is the budget(or lack there of) which takes away from the movies ability to portray realistic aliens or visitors or whatever they are. The aliens which are now easily recognized by there large black eyes in modern American pop culture look in this movie quite literally like cheap rubber balloons.(probably because that's what they are)Strieber's book however does not have the need for cheesy props to convey his story in convincing detail; probably the reason people had an interest in his book back in 1987. Ask anyone thoughwho has read his next several books on the same subject; if they are capable of thinking logicallythey will most likely tell you about the steady flow of contradictions ever present in his writing.This brings us to a second flaw in the movie which is",3.0

I don't recall much of the book being anything like the movie. There are no explainations to the visual circus that is happening on the screen. The movie really left me scratching my head.

" Let me begin this review by stating that I am a huge fan of Christopher Walken. OK I'm done. Do yourself a huge favor and buy the VHS version of this movie. The director's cut is so bad in places it's cathartic. At the very least it's enough to make you want to wash your brain out with soap and Walken's as well.I bought this because it is supposed to be one of Walken's finest works and it truly is. He is such a sensitive honest actor that even the most miserable script flows like water across his performances. I think he's a national treasure and like national treasures subject to horrific abuse. This movie unequivocally abuses Christopher Walken and lends credence to the rumors that the actor suffered a breakdown of sorts in his 40s. Just watch the out-takes of him cavorting in the most explicitly banal ways with plastic jumpy things that vaguely resemble a very bad joke by Arthur C. Clarke.ONCE you climb back down from the walls and IF this DVD survives a well deserved fling across the room and a naughty chuckle you may want to watch it again. This is not a joke. You spent money on this DVD you deserve to get something out of it. IF you discount the whole alien nonsense and view it from the perspective of a man coming to grips with a disintegrating mind complete with cheesy special effects (as most maudlin breakdowns entail) it really is quite good. Toss Whitley Streiber his wife and kid WATCH Walken as he rationalizes all this bizarre information in his intensely personal performance which is extraordinary. Read your own meaning into it achieve what you want and see a truly gifted actor dance perilously close to the edge of madness. ",3.0

" Is Strieber insane. Or is he making this crazy account up to sell books and inspire films? I'll have to say yes to the latter. However don't let that dissuade you from a creepy film like Communion. Although the plot is VERY disjointed there are very distubing scenes. Have you ever felt like an alien creature was creeping into your bedroom as you slept? Well you will after seeing a scene that depicts exactly that. Memorably disturbing scenes of this nature give this otherwise uninteresting film a decent shelf life. ",3.0

So I found the book and read it.Here is my comments and summary.I was amazed to learn that we were not doing to good economical in the 1700s. England got mad at us because we were no longer doing things they hoped America wouldso we went our way and they went thiers.America started declining in economics because we no longer had the machinery that England had supplied us with. We kept declining because we no longer knew how to do anything independantly. Suddenly we could grow cotton! Pulling the seeds out of the cotton was hard labor and the colonists could only produce 1 pound a day. Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin to make the labor of picking seeds out of cotton easier. He was not very good at reading but doing figures was easy.This helped him majorly in inventing the cotton gin and many other inventions. If you are interested in America's struggle for economics in thr 1700sI would highly recommend this great book. ",3.0

" It's a little gem of a book ~~ one I've had in my bookcases for a long time. This past weekend with everyone in my family struggling with the stomach flu ~~ I picked it up to read it as I needed something light and easy to read. It is a lovely insight in a family of three women of three generations. It's mostly about Charlie the midwife and all-around nurse. Her daughter Sophia and granddaughter Margaret were secondary characters but their stories are just as charming.Charlie grew up poor. She married the river ferryman. After their daughter Sophia was born they moved inland. Charlie kept her midwife practice going and soon her husband abandoned her to work on the Ohio River. It was just Charlie and Sophia till Sophia married a man who made a mockery of their wedding by wearing yellow shoes. While Sophia's daughter Margaret was still young Sophia became a widow.

" This book is a kind and gentle read. There are no startling insights or life-altering observations but it is worth reading because it does speak of values and ethical behavior. The grandmother is a strong woman whose opinions are revered and who doesn't tolerate fools.

Her daughter is lonely and well-meaning and the granddaughter is growing into herself and her beliefs with help from her grandmother. This book has charm. ",3.0

" I was suprised at how gossipy William Bradford was. He told tales about his neighbors and friends and described how the pilgrims constantly bickered with traders and their benefactors over money. My whole fantasy about what I thought the Pilgrims were like has completely changed. Now I consider them petty self-righteous gossip mongers. The book was good for general information about preparation for their trip and what they actually did when they got here but as far as historical fact goes I was unimpressed. Bradford discusses people who stray from the flock 'outsiders' who get girls pregnant drunkards and preachers who were not to his liking. It was more like a 'dish' session n the Jenny Jones show than something I would be proud to uphold as historical fact to the rest of the nation. ",3.0

" I purchased one of these coffee makers because the Mr. Coffee brand has been around for quite some time and it didn't cost a fortune. While the Mr. Coffee coffee maker worked good and made coffee as it should it does have a few design quirks. First of all the carafe is designed horribly. You can't pour a cup of coffee without it leaking down the side. This made it a pain and a mess to pour any coffee. Another less serious issue with it is the fact that the window showing you how high the water level in the coffee maker is frosted and makes it kind of difficult to see what the water level is (being that the unit is white). While this coffee maker is OK and does what it is supposed to there are better ones on the market for your money. ",3.0
" This book was released in Australia last year. Unlike most Lessing books I found this 1 unremarkable. Overall it reminded me of an angst-free 'The Four Gated City' (my favourite Lessing read). Compared with the 'The Four Gated City' instead of an island off the west(?) coast of Britain we get impoverished AIDS-ravaged Africa. The African setting and characters are a stark contrast to the well-nourished middle class London characters - affecting. ",3.0
" Structured in two sections set in London and Africa The Sweetest Dream is an interesting chronicle of the turmoil of western ideology in the post-World War era. Lessing bitterly attacks the dogmatic views on communism and justice held by leaderships which were soon forgotten when they rose to power. Instead her heroines are women (Julia Frances Silvia) whose political positions are not so defined but who rise above their circumstances to provide care and support to those around them. The section set in Africa is particularly intense and vivid. On the other hand plotwise the story meanders too much and often loses focus specially in the 60's part. I got the feeling that the novel would have improved with better editing. ",3.0
" but I wanted to finish it- I liked the characters - the comings and goings that politicals tend to attract. I wanted more development of some of the characters- this book has a huge cast! I really liked the idea of these homeless wandering young people and the idea that there are people who would open their homes to them. good character studies here I think ",3.0
" The Sweetest Dream begins as the story of Francis Lennox and the group of disparate youths who come in and out of her life and her London home. The era is evoked by Lessing in her typically intelligent prose with characters who are well-defined and a plot that although very loose is always interesting. Halfway through the book however the young Sylvia leaves to become a doctor in ravaged Africa and when she arrives there the book loses all its focus. It's a steep decline from the book's enjoyable first part and is emblematic of Lessing's tendency to (in her later works) go off the deep end and never really find her way back. Lessing is interesting throughout the book for her powers of observation as well as how she defines the character's desires and the way they intersect but the book nevertheless quickly becomes a tedious chore to finish as the plot offers a dwindling amount of storytelling for the reader to hold onto (or even be interested in). The end result is a mess a beautiful one that is written in earnest with genuine compassion at its center but a mess nonetheless. Tepidly recommended for Lessing completists only. ",3.0
" A good plot diluted with far too many sub-plots some of which were rather contorted.With remarkably few words this author can conjure up a vivid scene e.g.(pg.14)'she would go slowly upstairs leaving behind her on the stale air the odours of flowers and expensive face powder.' However at other times the story is bogged down with far too much detail.I liked some of the social and half-humorous statements that popped up from time to time. e.g the author's take on international conferences where 'they get paid to travel to some beauty spot and talk nonsence....they take off every day to see the lions and the giraffes and the dear little monkeys and I don't think they notice the land is perishing from the drought.' (437).There were a vast number of characters in this book making it difficult to keep track of everyone. What became of Clever and Zeberdee? We don't know. What became of Rose the journalistwho came to Zimlia and tried to undermine and wreek havoc for Sylvia? That thread was dropped unceremoniously. Why so much attention to Colin's daughter Celia at the very end? Above all how does the name of the book fit this story? ",3.0

" Thomas Hardy while certainly an extremely talented author seemingly had the knack of producing Victorian-era soap operas which never fails to depress even the most cheerful soul. Sometimes his depressing stories has a message that produces a somewhat cathartic reading experience (as with Tess of the D'Urbervilles) but with The Mayor of Casterbridge all we get is utter negativity. This mayor is one twisted selfish and self-loathing individual. He seems to live with a rain cloud over his head and doesn't quite understand how it is to be loved. Fun guy? Nope. And there isn't even a happy ending.Bottom line",3.0

" My giving this less than five stars has more to do with my reader experience than the novel itself. I'm just tired of neurotic English characters who are obsessed with class (are they ALL obsessed with class?) and destroy themselves due to inherent character flaws. Henchard is hot headed and makes bad decisions. He drinks repents drinks spirals out of control. This is almost a cliche in novels now. I suspect Hardy might be lost or relegated to Freshman English classes as the canon grows and embraces more 'diversity.' In short Dickens' characters are more interesting. Forster's visuals transfer better to the screen thanks thanks to the Merchant Ivory team. I hope Hardy does not get lost in the shuffle because I actually enjoyed the prose quite a bit although I probably liked his descriptions of the town and countryside and even some of the minor characters (that old 'seer' guy who predicted the weather) who were more representative on a mythic level more than Henchard.

" Though I expected sadness and misery I was hoping for something more profound at the ending than 'Happiness was but the occasional episode in a general drama of pain.'This is a many chaptered narrative that shows how the results of good intentioned-or-not mistakes can lead to personal ruin. The reader also will lose all respect for the main character.A problem with Victorian Period literary giants I have is their long sentences. I counted one at 82 words.Would only recommend this to someone who likes a challenging read (big words and colloquial language) and who doesn't mind a depressing predictable story.'The sun was resting on the hill like a drop of blood on an eyelid.' Best line. ",3.0
" I had never been so against reading a book in my life. Everything about it seemed boring; the cover the title and even the way the pages smelled. It was only the fact that Henchard sells his wife and baby in an auction; that kept my interest alive.Even with a premise as weird as this one the book's beginning was painful. It wasn't until later on that I discovered the book wouldn't be as painful as I feared. The Mayor of Casterbridge is based entirely on irony and coincidences. Never have I rolled my eyes so many times in disbelief.Hardy created a soap opera-like world in the town of Casterbridge. This actually gave a humorous appeal to the book. After every major section of the book you can't help but mumble 'Sure...'Some people deem this book 'Depressing' however The Mayor of Casterbridge didn't once give me a similar feeling. This book is presented in such a way that it helps you laugh at other people's misfortune.I wouldn't recommend this book as a 'free-read;' But if you must choose between a bunch of boring books and this one happens to be on the list then I highly recommend you choose it. It may seem boring at first but give it a chance; Hardy's humorous look at tragedy will give you a good laugh. I mean how bad can a book be that starts out with its central character actually selling his wife and baby girl at a fair? ",3.0
" R kelly shows a different side of him on this album with tracks showing more of his pain and suffering and not just focusing on booty calls. While listening to this album I hear traces of his old hits and formats and they are not new hits just carbon copies which for me take away from the album. R kelly has some winners on this album like 'I don't mean it' and 'A Woman's Threat' and the intro track 'TP-2' is off the hook. I wish that was longer I replay that one over and over. The 'I wish' remix brings tears to my eyes remembering my falling peoples.

" I wish to give R.Kelly his props. Vocally he's been compared to Charlie Wilson of the Gap Band and Aaron Hall of Guy but he's truly grown into his own man. I'd even go as far as saying that R. Kelly is the reigning King of R&B. He's done a whole lot in his over 10 years in the business. Let me give you a brief summary of his achievements.On his first album with the Public Announcement he gave us 'She's Got That Vibe' the now classic 'Honey Love' and 'Slow Dance'. He produced tracks for Hi-Five on the side. Then in 1993 he dropped his real debut '12-Play' with 'Bump and Grind' 'Sex Me' and my personal R.Kelly favorite 'My Body's Callin'...that's just the first half of his illustrious career.He introduced us to the exquisitely sensuous Aaliyah (and I'll leave that at that). Then he did a killer remix of Janet's 'Anytime Anyplace' wrote Michael Jackson's 'You Are Not Alone' and released a third album with cuts like 'You Remind Me Of Something' and the unforgettable song and video 'Down Low'. Then he worked with the Isley brothers Mary J. Blige and Toni Braxton. In the fall of 1996 he released 'I Believe I Can Fly' from the Space Jam soundtrack which won 3 Grammys.Then he released the 'R' album in 1998 a double CD that used elements of the '12 Play' cover art. I'll say it here",3.0
" R.Kelly is still doing his thing on this album. There's few songs that is worth hearing. Track 2581015 are ok. The problem with this album is that there's no major change on his style of singing after a while you can't tell the differences.If you are a huge R. Kelly fan you should try this album. ",3.0
" As good as R's other albums have been in past this one left me a little confused. As good as the production value and arrangements were on the album the lyrics leave a little to be desired. Granted 'I wish' is definitely a keeper along with 'I Don't Mean It Part II' and 'Strip for U'. The confusion comes from R's insistence to lace the majority of these songs with sex. How can U have a song which pays homage to a passed away homie('I Wish') and another song which promises a lover true commitment and sacrifice('I Decided') and then come back with disappointments like 'Fiesta' 'Greatest Sex' 'Like a Freak'and the worst one of all 'Feelin' on 'yo Booty'. R really disapponited me with that one. If R could have taken 'I Decided' or 'I Wish' and used one or both of these songs as the theme for this album I think he would have had a real winner on his hands. As it turns out you'll just have to be satisfied with an album where the good tunes R very good and the bad ones are well very BAD. ",3.0
" R. Kelly's 2000 album was one of his most successful and widely influential albums opening the star to a whole new fanbase mostly thanks to the excellent hit singles and their following remixes. Following the epic double albumR.from 1998 he returned two years later with another very ambitious album. This album is musically as soulful as any R. Kelly project and the pervading theme through the whole album is sex. The majority of the songs are bedroom jams or vocal conversations with women his seductive style being the main vibe. But he's at his best when he lets his spiritual side show and the gospel-tinged tracks are the best on the album. There are five or six songs on here that are among the very best of R. Kelly's career. These songs are uplifting inspiring and motivational otherwise clever and the type of song that exhibits his immense talent. He really is one of the finest talents in R&B; and there are more than a few instances where he flashes his amazing potential. However between the best tracks there is a steady supply of definite filler. The album is a lengthy 19 tracks long and it would be a much superior album if it were trimmed to about 12 (like its predecessor12 Play). The first half of the album contains way too many forgettable and predictable tracks while the second half is stacked with great material. The production is the type of big-budget music you'd expect on an R. Kelly album. This album contains some of the very finest material of R. Kelly's great career but be ready to sit through some substantial filler to get to it.The introductory title track opens the album a short and upbeat opener. 'Strip For You' is a forgettable sex song some early skip material before the very good 'R&B; Thug.' This song is well produced and R. Kelly sings in a fast staccatoed style that works nicely. I don't like 'The Greatest Sex' a fairly redundant and unmemorable song. 'I Don't Mean It' and 'Just Like That' are much better; while they're not among the album's best songs they're solid and enjoyable cuts. 'Like a Real Freak' and 'Fiesta' are both Latin-influenced club songs both fall under skip material for me I wish the Jay-Z collaborated 'Fiesta (Remix)' were included on the tracklist instead. 'Don't You Say No' emits some nice musical vibes and 'One Me' is a pretty good song too. The album gets great at about this point. The beautiful 'I Wish' arguably the finest song of his storied career is a sad yet uplifting song to a lost friend speaking of life since their passing. 'A Woman's Threat' however is among the worst songs on this album six banal and repetitive minutes and his verses sound like a shopping list. 'I Decided' is among my favorites with a great hook and good performance 'I Mean (I Don't Mean It)' is a little upbeat and funky. I think my favorite song here might be the touching remix to 'I Wish' titled 'I Wish (To the Homies That We Lost).' R. Kelly does not make remixes like most artists and his remixes are entirely new compositions of songs with the only similarities being the similar subject matter. 'To the Homies That We Lost' is equally as effective as the original 'I Wish' a more personal narrative to his lost friend. The production is beautiful and this song is excellent. The pretty good 'All I Want' comes next followed by the wonderful 'Feelin' on Yo Booty.' This infamous song showcases R. Kelly at his seductive best being humorous and clever despite maybe crossing the line a little here and there. The album closes with another of the finest songs in his discography the motivational 'The Storm Is Over' a well-written gospel-tinged track complete with a dramatic key change at the end.When this album is good it's great but at its worst it's redundant and forgettable. One can't deny that this contains some of the very best songs R. Kelly has to offer and for that fact alone this is an album I recommend. R. Kelly is one of the finest talents in R&B; and much of this album is a great example of this. More economical buyers might just want to buy the half-dozen or so best songs but overall this is a worthy purchase to make. ",3.0
" I have mostly all the R. Kelly albums and if I say so myself this is not his best of work. When I listen to this album I don't hear the soulful artist like before. I hear rap and that's the way he has changed. Don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with rap. I just didn't want to see him go this way.

" There is no denying the fact R Kelly has got a great voice and is very talented that is why he can turn some mediocre songs into hits.

Songs such as 'Just Like That'  'Fiesta' 'I Wish' 'A Woman's Threat' 'I Mean(I Don't Mean It)' and the inspirational 'The Storm is Over Now' are the ones that really stands out and the more you listen to it the more it grows on you. But compared to '12 Play' this album is a three star. ",3.0
" I have all of R Kelly's albums. The man has a great voice. In this album it seems that the executives may have had too much influence in his music. What happened to the R&B? I know Hip-Hop is happen'n but it's not really fitting R Kelly.This album does have it's highs. One is R Kelly's voice and his mix of Hip Hop and his R&B style. It make a sweet CD to play. The lyrics are truely R Kelly though the record label's influence does have him getting 'To The Homies'.If R Kelly really got intouch with himself he could be the 'King of Soul'. This point really seems to hold him back and this album is a good reflection of this. As the self proclaimed 'King of Soul' he does excellent but can do better. ",3.0
" When R. Kelly is at the top of his game he is one of the greatest R & B singers in the biz. Like pretty much every other Kelly album there are the standout songs but the rest are just fill-ins. Standouts on this album are the upbeat 'fiesta' the emotional 'I Wish' (both versions) the eerily bumpy 'A Woman's Threat' the uplifting ' The Storm is Over' and the slow emotional 'the Greatest Sex'. The rest of the album is mediocre. Had Kelly cut the number of songs on this album he could have made an album you could listen all the way through and love the whole thing......unfortunately for us he didnt. ",3.0

" Boot Hill is a Guiseppe Colizzi film and Colizzi also directed 'Ace High'. Spaghetti western fans will appreciate Boot Hill as an essential addition to their collections and Colizzi maintains the gritty realism throughout. Colizzi began experimenting with rapid action close-ups and handheld camera work in this film -- sometimes it works and sometimes doesn't. In the opening scene Colizzi manages to capture an 'art house' film effect which spaghetti western fans will love but traditional western movie fans will probably deplore. Colizzi also introduces the idea of an Italian-style circus to a western town which is truly bizarre yet creative throughout. But the biggest problem with this movie - besides the technically poor rendering from film - is the lack of a cohesive plot structure. The story gets far ahead of itself early on and the viewer will wonder if 'Boot Hill' is really three separate films rolled into one. There is a midway point where a third character is introduced to effect a situation where the protagonist can explain things and even tell us what will happen next! To complicate matters further the roles of two characters are never made clear. Even after watching this movie several times it is not entirely understandable to most viewers that this movie is about a large mining company trying to defraud small prospectors from their claims with a circus thrown in to create interest. Diehard spaghetti western fans love Colizzi's juxtaposed plot style and many of us watch these films over and over picking out new details every time.

" Originally published in 1922 and out of print for years *Lady into Fox* by David Garnett has recently been republished by McSweeneys in a beautiful jacket-less hardcover. It is illustrated with wonderful woodcuts by R.A. Garnett. It is a well written novella with a fanciful tone.This is the story of Mr. Tebrick and his wife who in the first few pages turns into a fox. Mr. Tebrick though taken aback by his wife's new condition still loves his wife even through her adulterous affair with another fox and her [...] kits from this affair. Even more complicating the story is that they live an area of England where fox hunting is a daily pastime - one that Mr. Tebrick has enjoyed on many an occasion in the past.So why you ask did I only give this book 3 stars? Unfortunately I knew exactly where the book was going and exactly how it was going to end within a few pages of Mrs. Tebrick's transformation into a fox; and the story played out as I expected leaving me no joy in the discovery no surprises no pleasure in the reading.This doesn't mean that others won't enjoy *Lady into Fox* only that I didn't even though this a nicely packaged and well written book.>>>>>>><<<<<<<A Guide to my Book Rating System",3.0

" I am a teacher of Egyptian Belly Dance primarily but also teach Turkish style belly dance steps in my classes. Several of my students have been asking me about this new DVD.First let me say that the DVD has many charms and is best suited to beginner/advanced beginner students but that for the serious intermediate/advanced and professional teacher or performer there are stronger academically attentive and more thorougly researched DVDs on the market. Miss Sarah Skinner cites Eva Cernik Dalia and Elizabeth Artemis Mourat as among her teachers. I have had the pleasure and honor of studying with these accomplished master teacher and performers as well and recommend their DVDs/VHS tapes for turkish (Eva and Elizabeth Artemis Mourat) and dynamic skirt dance/fusion styles (Dalia's video media and a superb music CD).For the Beginner and Advanced Beginner student this DVD includes at least one turkish traveling step I have seen taught by Eva and Artemis- and is a good start for a student with no previous knowledge base. American fusion type skirt dancing steps are also included also helpful for the beginner. There are simple choregraphies throughout the DVD well executed that will be helpful to beginner students but frankly lack the fire passion and wild playful abandon that for me is so quintissentialy turkish.The costuming section is an excellent rundown for students teachers and performers and the strongest section of the DVD. In fact Ms. Skinner has a great eye for costumes and color combinations and I would love to see a DVD from her in the future focusing solely on this topic. I am not sure if there are any up to date DVDs in recent years on this topic currently on the market at the moment.The veil number was very beautiful and again a great study for beginners and others who may not be ready to or want to do complex turns and intricate veil combinations. This number gives great ideas for 'still' shots and dramatic poses that are audience eye catching. The costume here was elegant and Sarah is a very pretty dancer with flowing dark hair who carries off the mood of this piece spledindly. I did find it odd though that the music was a classic Andalusian piece sung in spanish- on a DVD touting 'Turkish' dance.Overall a useful DVD for beginners with lots of great costume and still shot pose ideas...However perhaps a different choice in title touting the many rich and various threads of the fusion style belly dance taught and perforemd in this DVD would have more aptly described the total DVD.

" I bought this DVD just to look at and get ideas for costume making - and this DVD is a great inspiration for that as it has a section set aside for costume making. Sarah's costumes are gorgeous - aaah those skirts - I want them! As I am sure you will too.The choreographies are ok but I will change them a little to suit my own style I like the music Sarah used. And as a drummer (Drummer/Dancer) I found myself watching and listening to the drummers instead of watching Sarah dance. I may have to go back later and watch Sarah (sorry Sarah) ha ha. But I found it useful as i was able to play along with the drummers.But all in all - I would recommend this DVD for those of you who are as mad on dancing and drumming as I am. And it is reasonably priced. ",3.0

I would presume the future books will continue at the pacing set in the last 100 pages of this one or at least I hope they do.The zombies a.k.a.",3.0
" The whole autumn series.. If your not used to actual english style writing you will possibly find it slow boring or annoying in some way. This series isn't too bad with it but its there. The story is really good but for long expanses it seems the characters just sit around and whine for chapters at a time. The action parts of the book are really good but these long expanses of supposed hopeless despair suffered by the characters also truely gets felt by the reader due to how boring it gets to hear some brits whine and cry about losing their families. I guess it's pretty realistic on that part because the end of the world would be pretty horrible. But it also made it pretty hard to force myself to keep reading each of the books from this series. I think the only reason I continued to read them was because I already bought the whole set and so I can count them in my collection of zombie books I've read. ",3.0
" I have to admit that I tried hard to love this book. However I could only find myself liking it. It just seems to move far too slowly. It is well written and there are even some moments that will have you at least inching forward in your seat but it just did not grab me. I will continue on with the series and see if perhaps it picks up. The story IS good enough to make me want to continue. ",3.0
" This is by no means the worst book I have read but I could never shake the dark feeling that I was being cheated somehow. I wanted to root for the characters but I found myself caring less over the course of the read instead of more. While I wanted depth and complexity to the characters they were shallow and contradictory. Ultimately I could not connect with them and wished they would just die already.The storyline was only marginally better and too many twists just felt.contrived. ",3.0
" I have to agree with much of Mr Goddard's review. The story is like walking in dense woods - you wonder how long before you get to the other side. Since this is a the first of a few books and it was a FREE download I'm going to give the series a fair shot with the next book. If the progress stays this slow I am out.Detail is good and character development as well but for so much time spent with the characters you'd think you'd know their backgrounds better. Zombie encounters had a unique take with their own development but they were limited. Honestly this feels more like half a book and perhaps it was the author's intention.So overall it's not a bad book but it is incomplete. The next volume may flesh it out.Look up Moody and Autumn on Google and you'll find the author's website with the download. I read it in about 3 hours. ",3.0
" David Moody Autumn (Infected Books 2002)To take an old publishing saw and turn it on its head for every million self-published disasters where cartons of bloody horrible novels sit in an author's basement waiting for a single sale there's one monstrous awe-inspiring success story where a self-published author becomes richer than Croesus based on word of mouth alone.But I'm not here to talk about Christopher Paolini I'm here to talk about David Moody. Who is not yet Croesus but probably will be given a few more years.Autumn is like nothing you're ever read. It is often referred to in word-of-mouth gatherings as a zombie novel (and in some cases the zombie novel) and it's blurbed as a zombie novel on its cover. But here's the thing",3.0
" If you're into zombie books you'll know this story well. It's very predictable.

" ...I'll just talk about the book as a physical object.The print is large and glossy. Not grade school primer large but still larger than normal novel type. But it's the glossy that gets me made it hard to read in bed with the light right behind me. The reflecting words disappear into the page. Rather aggravating.The cover has a rather gruesome illustration on the front. No problem I see gruesome pictures all the time. The back of the book though has a TERRIFYING picture. It scared me this tiny zombie face in a sea of blackness. When I read the book I had to be careful to keep it angled so that my wife couldn't see the front or especially the back cover. She would've been left climbing the walls all night.Unfortunately the cover design is slightly amatuerish and the defining line is visible between the black edge of the graphic and the black of the book cover. Eh who cares? I don't not really but it bothered me when I noticed it.My reaction to the story in brief was boredom shooting to tangible fear half way through. The writing isn't the best at points and an awful lot of time is spent on the feelings of the characters but when the horror kicks in it was upsetting.I will be buying the next book. ",3.0

" First let me applaud the author on creating a compelling Zombie world in which to take his readers through. With some nice twists (Zombies which do not immediately rise and when they do...don't immediately notice the Living..brilliant!)...this book is written with a more serious tone than some other books in the genera might be. This is a book for the person looking for a Zombie drama not a Zombie Die-Hard experience. Also because the situation takes place in England its a refreshing change of location.Unfortunately at least for me this book takes a very very very long time to get rolling. The very cool twist with the zombies I mention above is not used as well as it could have been in fact its somewhat tragic that the book didn't explore this situation further. Soon the situation changes and the standard human-attacking zombie is back in the fold. This is a cool idea that I hadn't encountered before and frankly I wished the author had spent more time here....it could have *really* made the pacing of this book unique (rather than the standard Humans-Run-From-Attacking-Zombies).Also endless reminders of the shattered psyche of the characters really starts to get in the way after a certain point particularly when nothing much is happening. When things do get rolling the story immediately begins to mirror...well.....isolated Farmhouse? 'nuff said. So we are treading on a bit of conquered ground to a certain extent. This by itself isn't an issue...but because the book takes quite a bit of time to get our characters to said farmhouse it seems to all wrap up fairly quickly...as though the Author only wanted to include enough 'meat' in this book to sell the sequel.One last thing because we are always reminded of the horror the characters are experiencing the author seems that gives them carte blanche to behave like jerks all the time. This gets old since halfway through the book I was hoping they'd all get wiped out and a new more 'deserving' bunch of humanity would appear ",3.0

" Well I got as far as page 150 and was ready to toss this book. I couldn't let it beat me w/ 130 pages left so I read on. What happened is that the book actually started to pick up and became readable.If you can handle an overly long setup and zombies that do nothing for over 1/2 of the story then you may like this little tale.There are better zombie books out there (and lord knows there are worse ones) so if you just saw the dawn of the dead movie and want to try some zombie horror I would begin w/ The Rising or The Walking Dead (TPB but the best zombie fiction out there). I also hear Twilight of the Dead is good.For me I have read most of the stuff out there and find this book falls somewhere in the middle. I will probably pick up the next book but don't feel compelled to do so.If You are in the middle of the book and are wondering if the zombies will actually do something well just keep reading and around page 160 the story will begin to pick up and ends well.

" Here's a great way to make a buck. Take some classic old 78 rpm church hollers and barrel-house rockers and sync in some beats per minute and have people call you a break-thru musical genius. I have to give Moby credit though. At least he's introducing compu-teens and upwardly-mobile handshakers to the shakes and quakes of the old school yard groove. When he keeps the field out of the studio he creates some thoughtful moments such as 'Porcelain'. And original collaborations like 'Why does my heart feel so bad' shine as well. Overall the album flows nicely and makes a satisfying salute to the joy of music. But has Moby changed the face of music? At the very least he's learned how to program its soul. My recommendation",3.0
" Play is a good album for the people who are new to electronica. I have to admit though Moby could have been more creative. He often uses a voice sample excessively. THat can be a little annoying. I hope Moby challenges himself further in later albums. I guess Play is Moby way to further finance himself. It's to commercial and plus he isn't the first to use gospel and blues singers is electronica. Moby is good but Recoil is better. ",3.0
" Hey overall this is a good album. HOWEVER... because it was such a big pop hit everyone thinks that they are really hip and into the electronica scene. THIS ALBUM IS NOT ELECTRONICA it's blues rock etc. with a beat and a synthasizer. In fact I find it rediculiously cheasy at certain parts (beginning of track 3). 'Body Rock' is kind of annoying. Despite all my criticisms Play is still really fun to listen to when you're high. ",3.0
" I bought this CD when it was released in 1999. Back then it seemed very avante garde. I thought I'd revisit it more than ten years on.The fact is it hasn't worn very well. What seemed new and innovative then seems rather old fashioned now. The sounds have been overtaken by better produced more technologically interesting creations and the revival of melody has left these non-melodic pieces behind. It's not unpleasant just repetitious and soporific.Moby like so many others was a fad. Briefly popular as the latest thing ultimately the material didn't have the staying power to be more than a passing success. Buy it for nostalgic purposes if that's a time you look back on fondly.

" This Moby CD is pretty good. I bought the CD and thoroughly enjoyed the first couple of spins. Over time I realized that the CD is just good (versus pretty good).

" When listening to Moby's magnum opus I couldn't help but notice the similarity to benign pop sclock like Will Smiths 'Get Jiggy With It' as opposed to brilliant electronica like Fat Boy Slims 'Praise You'.

" Well you know Moby is doing something right since this CD from 1999 is on all kinds of best-of lists even making #20 of Rolling Stones's best albums of the 90's (not that the mag has any musical relevance anymore). Maybe it's because Moby puts a face to the often anonymous genre of electronica. Maybe it's because he's American and his music is more easily understood by mainstream critics than say trance or techno.Or perhaps it's because he took a simple concept- melding old blues samples with a fresh paint of electronic music and made a series of inspiring sometimes beautiful songs. 'Honey' 'Find my baby' 'Why does my heart feel so bad' 'Run on' and especially 'Natural Blues' are proof of that.But that's only about a third of the 18 tracks on this album and they all must stand judgement. And this is where the CD falls flat. You get a selection of tracks where Moby does the singing or speaking 'South side' 'If things were perfect' 'The sky is broken' and 'Porcelain' and with the exception of the latter none have music good enough to carry his thin high-pitched voice.Filling out the disc (besides 'Bodyrock' the catchiest piece with guitar and a sample of Love Rap) are a series of short instrumental fillers '7' and 'Down Slow' and simple acoustic/ambient pieces (the last three tracks). These won't be the tracks you remember.There are some excellent discs here but they're within the first 11 of 18 songs. If you don't mind skipping around you'll enjoy this but it doesn't reward a complete listen. ",3.0
" I know the personality of the performer should be irrelevant when judging the quality of the music BUT 1] Moby allowing his music to be used for car ads strikes me as immensely hypocritical considering his so-called 'green' credentials and 2] the sheer EGO of the man that came across during his recent Glastonbury performance really stuck in the craw bigtime. A shame - as I would have given the album an unconditional ***** only six months ago... ",3.0
" Moby's 'Play' CD is a real treat - loads of great tracks. However the quality of the recording is among the worst I've ever heard. The recording quality is so bad that I can only listen to the CD in my car - it's off limits to my high-end stereo set-up. 'Porcelain' one of the best tracks on the CD is a case in point - great music but the background noise/hiss is so prevelant that I wonder whether it was introduced onto the track on purpose for some warped reason. Music rating - 5stars but the quality is the worst of all my 200 CDs and so I must call attention to this dramatic flaw - overall rating 3stars (Moby do yourself and everyone else a favor and get another recording company!!)

It doesn't make you better to call what other like crap.In short don't write the 5 star 'it changed my life' review because it doesn't do anybody any good and you probably aren't exactly a musical expert either.

" In the 90's I was all about Moby. His music was in major films people on MTV were talking to him all the time and the era was just right for popularizing electronic music at the time. I've seen him live 3 times and he doesn't exactly disappoint but his music does start to wear down on me. This album was the first I ever picked up by him and I needed to review it.Off the bat most of the album is an exploration into the fascination of sampling old works into new ideas. You get at least six songs on this album devoted to nothing more than exhuming old tracks and layering them over filtered mid-tempo drums. To me it's not that exciting anymore and it feels dated. There's moments where Moby goes back to his previous albums and starts singing...that's a bad thing to me too since he doesn't have a great voice in my opinion and one track (The Sky Is Broken) is just flat-out creepy requests for communication from someone. Moby is the master of moody inspirational instrumentals and 'Porcelain' became a hit after being featured in the movie 'The Beach' because of his interesting piano-meets-breaks-meets-synthpads approach. And he repeats this formula four other times on the album making the single 'Bodyrock' a little confusing to those expecting a new Fatboy Slim-inspired album.My favorites on this album are 'Machete' and 'Inside.' They're two opposite sounds that sum up what Moby is all about. It's important to note the instrumentation on the album as well especially since now in 2011 everything has become more digitally-created and 'messed with' so I can respect some of the guitar and piano in songs on this album. However songs like '7' need to go (just horrible guitar noodling over a cheap drum beat). Overall I might buy this if you're into DJ Shadow or more generic electronic music that is used for filler but it's gotten a little bland for my taste nowadays. ",3.0
" ...spoil an album that was teetering on the brink anyway. I am not familiar with Moby's music before this album and have heard the spiel about how he changes style and direction with every album and is a musical genius who calls himself the 'little idiot' blah blah blah wurble wurble. However after hearing 'Why does my heart feel so bad?' I was prepared to give him a go. Well I can tell you none of the music press rhapsodising rang true to me. When first I listened to this album I thought all the songs sounded very alike but decided that each would become more distinct the more I heard it. I was wrong. I know all music is formulaic but this is ridiculous. As singles all these songs would be good but as an album they fail to really make an impression. An album to me is a whole piece constructed of different yet interlocking pieces. This however was rather 'variations on a popular theme' and as we know what is once popular very soon becomes old and boring. Yes these bright brittle and sometimes sad songs are individually well worth the listen",3.0
" It would be hard to imagine using words like 'sweet' 'touching' or 'moving' to characterize most standard-issue techno but they're surprisingly appropriate for the best moments of the latest effort from this enigmatic and frustrating but ultimately winsome artist.To judge from the two hundred-plus remarks already posted Moby's samplings of country gospel and blues have left the largest impression on audiences. Such deployments of field recordings in club music usually run from clever to offensive raising the same spectors of cultural piracy that haunted the white blues bands of the British Invasion but here the device is one poetic license that Moby's heartfelt sincerity elevates and redeems. His guileless expressiveness often catches you unexpectedly-- listen closely for example to 'Natural Blues' for the sudden stab of grief in its starkly understated instrumental break.Most of the eighteen tracks fall into one of three categories; African-American samplings ('Honey' 'Natural Blues' 'Run On') Caucasian raps ('South Side' 'Bodyrock' most of them not so much offensive as painfully embarrassing) and ambient compositions.This last group is in some ways the most rewarding. 'Porcelain' on the strength of its eloquence survives being conscripted into the soundtrack for Leonardo DiCaprio's latest potboiler while 'Inside' manages to break the limits of lyricism by transforming distantly spaced notes like constellations emerging from the dusk into beautifully sustained melody. It's Gorecki not Glass who's the fitting peer for work as resonant as this.Moby's six years of diffuse releases may have stretched the patience of his core constituency but a larger audience awaits if he can lose the blue-eyed hip-hop and open up further to his inner depth.

" Moby's newest cd Play is hyped by many magizines (Spin Q Entertainment Weekly ext) all giving Play great reviews. Play is a great cd. I do recommend that you don't go out and blindly buy this not knowing the kind of music it is. Play is a mix of techno rock and blues. If you are a lyrics person there is not much to these songs. If you are looking for meaningful lyrics check out some bob dylan material. But there are some great songs on this cd.Like alot of people i only listen to around the first side of Play. Play is actually worth buying for the first side. Alot of quality songs (bodyrock south side ext). The South Side song on this album is not the remix with Gwen Stefani. For that you have to buy the single. South Side much more rock than most of the songs. Play has a great upbeat sound to them but have the depressing sound added also for a great sounding cd.I was really in a bind on whether or not I should give Play 3 or 4 stars. I sided with 3 because like I said earlier in this review I usually only listen to the first side or so. But this is a cd worthy of anyone's record collection. I do not regret buying it at all. ",3.0

" I can see how a CD like this could be a revelation to anyone who is not familiar with ambient music or electronica. Moby has put together a solid block of excellent pieces with 'Play'. Trouble is to a certain extent it's all been done before. Sure it's neat that Moby borrows vocal tracks from diverse sources and fuses them to awesome electronic treatments (not to mention exemplary keyboard and guitar work) but Eno and Byrne did the same thing back in 1982 with 'My Life in the Bush of Ghosts' (which is more interesting and challenging - with far more musical tension - than Moby's 'Play'). Moby's ambient pieces are also great (sometimes sounding like a sort of Eno/Yanni hybrid) but I prefer a tad more 'bas relief' in my musical wallpaper (such as for example the 'Passengers' soundtracks CD featuring Bono & the Edge and - for truly great ambience - Eno's 'Music for Films'). Finally Moby's 'quasi-underground rave rap' numbers are sort of cool but once again you'll find far more interesting hunting for such beasties on Eno's 1992 effort 'Nerve Net' and others like it. In short I was somewhat disappointed that I immediately liked this CD. I prefer to be challenged initially and then over time learn to love a new sounding approach to music. Don't get me wrong - there is some great stuff on this CD. I was just hoping for more. ",3.0
" The reason I bought this album like most people was the single 'South Side' a remix of which (featuring Gwen Stefani) plays on the radio. So listening to 'Play' was somewhat of a shock since South Side is the most rock-based song on the CD and it dosn't have Gwen's voice in it making it sound hollow. I was also taken aback by the lack of lyrical content (which is the main thing I look for in music) but the messages of the music are conveyed through the music -- all the electronic instruments loops and samples come together in an artful arrangement. I'm still not crazy about it but it is really a very good album. ",3.0
" ...I'm always looking for something different to track on my car stereo. My friendly neighborhood record store clerk directed me to this. It will according to he make me fall in love with whoever invented multitracking and DJ Teching...Yep I've heard of Moby but never had the opportunity to hear any of his sounds. Prior to this I've enjoyed Massive Attack Morcheeba Bjork Groove Armada.While Moby has some interesting pieces here I've found the other electronica and DJ type music mentioned above much more to my liking. Not to say Moby's stuff is bad. Let's just say it's cool... When I heard the first track it put to mind those early solo Paul McCartney tracks where he recorded tunes by playing all the instruments and he overdubbed he and Linda on the vocals. Some of Moby's instrumentals remind me of some of Badalamente's work with surrealist David Lynch but you know what? If I want Badalamente I'd buy Badalamente...speaking of another artist with the letters b a d in his name a few of the tracks reminded me also of jamacian multi-instrumentalist and one of my favorite keyboardist Wally Badarou but you know what? If I wanted Badarou I'd buy Badarou.This product of Moby is OK in my opinion. But it's no masterpiece. ",3.0

I personally do not give a scybalum about Moby's personal or political views. He's a gifted artist; so was Kurt Cobain so is Carlos Santana so was Richard Wagner. But I just want to warn you about the nonsense in his liner notes. Waawaawaa... poor moby. We mistreat our prisoners. Yeah if you get put into jail for a DUI or white collar crime and you are brutalized and sodomized that stinks.

" While it does cover a wide range of wildlife the drawings themselves are not very realistic - they represent the animal yes but not accurately enough to really be used as a teaching field guide even for non-magors. It'd probably be ok for younger kids though. There were some magor types of wildlife that I thought should be included that were not (red-tail hawk box turtle) as well as some that I don't know why they're in there (humpback whale viruses). The descriptions were short and included very little as to where the animals were actually found (no idea of range). The plants section was really tiny as well. Needless to say I'm still searching for a field guide to use in my class. ",3.0
" This compact book labeled and formatted as a field guide introduces young naturalists to city wildlife. It ranges widely among organisms in urban areas including many familiar mammals and birds as well as skimming a few bacterium viruses protoctists fungi and plants into the mix. Including these latter life forms reminds readers that there's a lot of life going unnoticed much of it too small to even see right around them. If however kids want to identify wildlife around them the usual reason to get a field guide including wildlife that literally cannot be seen is out of place. This latter issue rubs especially since so many more likely critters; ones that many kids will see around their neighborhoods were not included.Attractive illustrations are offered at one per entry and each entry is described in a few sentences. Don't expect the kinds of details in adult field guides. No information is offered on variations in size and appearance by sexes ages and seasons which can be essential for field identification. Nor are ranges presented. What this really offers is a general introduction to the neglected part of nature outside kids' front doors in an easy-to-browse format. For older independent readers. ",3.0
" I read Peterson First Guide to Urban Wildlife cover to cover since it's quite brief and succinct. It's oddly organized--despite claiming on the back cover that it focuses on the 'things you are most likely to see' it begins with a discussion of microscopic organisms including the common cold virus something everyone is familiar with through experience and yet not at all likely ever to see. The insect section covers many common household pests including 4 different kinds of cockroaches but only 4 butterfly species. The selection seems almost random at times; why include trees at all if there is room for only two and why those two? There are no maps and the information on ranges is often vague. However despite being very familiar with most of the animals and plants included I learned a few new things about some of them--for example that common barnacles are crustaceans not mollusks.Overall this is probably a handy little book for beginners or young people who don't have a lot of opportunity to get far from human habitations. It would make a fine addition to an elementary school library. The writing and illustrations are clear and easy to understand but anyone with much outdoor experience or a desire to learn more about individual species will quickly outgrow it. ",3.0

" Alice McDermott once again proves her best-selling author status in her novel THAT NIGHT. McDermott represents her original style of writing and her different point of view of important issues faced by the youth of today and yesterday. In this novel she expands on a subject that is sometimes overlooked or shoved under the proverbial rug. This subject can be summarized in two words teenage pregnancy. She uses her off-the-wall style of writing to enhance the importance of this subject and yet at the same time show the humorous side of it by portraying the story through the eyes of a child. Alice McDermott's purpose in writing the book That Night was to explore the other side of a teenage pregnancy the side that deals with the emotions and feelings of the teens. She foreshadows the pregnancy by portraying the boyfriend as a hoodlum to begin with so the pregnancy is believable and the relationship between the two teens is credible. Judging from the story McDermott's values are somewhat flexible. She shows the relationship between the two kids as young and immature yet she seems almost as if she condones the pregnancy. McDermott shows a moderately unbiased view towards the subject she writes about by continually shifting the focus to the young child through which the story is told. This act nonchalantly brings about the first person point of view from which she tells the story. McDermott's style is uniquely set apart from any other novel in its class. She jumps from present into past into present again but she doesn't lose the attention of the reader somehow. Her tone is very laid back and conversational yet she still shows her point of view in a very realistic manner. The story of two young teens in a passionate love affair really catches the attention of the reader. McDermott's use of symbolism in using two passionate teens to represent the hot summer nights is extraordinary. McDermott shows the irony of a little girl relating the story of a teen in the middle of a life decision that she although much later will have to face in her future. The diction used by McDermott proved also to be original. She depicts the little girl as being more mature than she really is by relating the deep and intelligent thoughts through the 8 year old. Her diction although original is somewhat unreal. McDermott fails to have the little child converse with anyone and also fails to give her a name. Granted this fact may have some valid reasoning that is hidden among the suspense of the fighting and mystery. McDermott has the plot unravel in an odd sequence which enhances the element of suspense in the novel. She uses intense imagery to display the raw emotion taking place in the novel. Descriptions of the fight are prevalent throughout the novel because the whole plot of the story is based around the one night when everyone's emotions went wild and the explanation of why this happened. I believe that Alice McDermott has her very own style of writing and she has a very effective style of writing. Although I may not always agree with the way she introduced an idea or event I highly regard her opinion and accept that she has reasoning for writing the way she does and introducing things the way she does. Her literary tactics are completely her own and they do an excellent job of making the reader think and contemplate on a new level. Her use of retelling the story through the eyes of an unbiased child is genius. By relating her novel in this means also heightens the innocence factor of the novel. That Night by Alice McDermott confirms this author's ability to bring forth a novel of such character and originality that it can become a best seller. Her other novels also attest to her brilliant writing style however odd it may seem. Making a best sellers list usually requires large amounts of experience but Alice McDermott accomplished this status twice within only a few years of a published career. ",3.0

" I was very looking forward to reading this book because it came highly recommended and because it seemed to be a guide for walking in the footsteps of many dedicated Christians. I am sorry to say that I was a little disappointed. Although many parts of the book are really excellent Ms. Norris spends too much time making commentary instead of just sharing the experience. I really enjoyed when she shared how she was moved by prayer to a point of conversion. And how the experience of the cloister strengthened her sense of self and her marriage. But the chapter on St. Maria Goretti while making a valid point was overkill. Still it is worth the effort through the tedious parts for the nuggets of wisdom which are also to be found there. My recommendation skip over the platitudes and embrace the jewels. ",3.0
" This is one woman's journey sketching her life her troubles and her spiritual salvation through a Benedictine Monastery. Quoting the Bible extensively Ms. Norris tells of her experiences with the Monks and Nuns. She is a writer a searcher and a poet. Words are her vehicle to explain life and God. She sees the poetic in the mundane and the special in the everyday. It is worth reading even for people who are 'non-biblical'. I found it interesting. The cover blurb reads '. . .Strange & Interesting . . .' which is apropo. ",3.0

And she has that great gift of seeming to write for all of us.My only objection to the book has nothing to do with style or her lyrical prose but with her use of obscenity-twice- about a third of the way through. It is just so unnecessary--even if you don't see it as wrong--for this to be found in a book on Christian Spirituality. To me it keeps me from recommending the book to some who might otherwise really benefit from seeing the world through Kathleen Norris' eyes. Which is a real shame. ",3.0
" Book ReviewThe Cloister WalkIn Kathleen Norris' book The Cloister Walk she invites the readers into her life as a Protestant poet feminist married woman who is drawn to the monistic life of the Benedictines. She details the struggles she has with reconciling what she knew as a child with what she is learning today. Kathleen also finds great joy in experiencing life as she does and seems to have no intentions of converting to the Catholic faith; she is happy being Protestant. While Kathleen takes the reader on her journey with her she takes time to fill the reader in on her past so that they can fully appreciate her present.This book was not what I expected when I first chose it specifically from its title. I was expecting a book about someone who is in a cloister and writing about that life but once I understood what the intent of the book was I enjoyed journeying with Kathleen. I also found myself wanting to know what happened in her life once the pages ended. One of the biggest strengths of the book was that it was engaging and kept me interested in Kathleen's life. The book also shed some light on the Benedictine life and left me wanting to know more. In my position at my parish I am often asked about good books. I can easily suggest this one as an option though not as a book to obtain knowledge about the Catholic faith but as a good summer read which I think can often times be very valuable. ",3.0
" THE CLOISTER WALK is a hodgepodge. In part it is a fragmented memoir of a fifty-year-old woman who was a poet and ten years previously after being at loose ends for much of her life had found sanctuary of sorts as an oblate with the Benedictines. In part it is a journal of nine months of experiences at a Benedictine monastery (St. Johns Abbey in Collegeville Minnesota). And in part it is a collection of religious writings some spiritual in nature and some historical. One of my problems with the book is that those different parts or aspects of the book are too jumbled. The book does not cohere; for me it scatters into its 75 or so entries (ranging from one to eighteen pages) like the seeds of a dandelion on a breezy day.If there is one thing that unites the book that is its author. THE CLOISTER WALK is not one of those books in which the author is unobtrusive. Kathleen Norris is on every page and the reader is presented in full measure with her apprehensions and insecurities her joys and epiphanies as well as her preachings. At one point in the book she writes 'I am observing my life more than living it' and that characteristic imparts an introspective intensity that leaves me notwithstanding my admiration for her somewhat uncomfortable. The author who takes the reader on this cloister walk is not a relaxed person and her existential intensity - existential tension even - ends up coloring many of the things she shows and describes.Nonetheless I found many parts of the book rewarding especially the descriptions of contemporary monastic life the discussions of the Psalms and the Book of Revelations and the accounts of assorted religious figures from history such as Mechtild of Magdeburg Mary of Egypt the Virgin Martyrs and Ephrem the Syrian. And while to my way of thinking there is more than a little gibberish - for example the passages on the difficult role of poets and artists in today's world - there also are nuggets worth salting away. Here's one",3.0
" As a woman who worships with both Protestants and Catholics on a regular basis I thought that I would enjoy the perspective of a born and raised Protestant living as an oblate in a Benedictine monastery.I consider myself to be a somewhat literary person although not poetic and found the poet Kathleen Norris to be rather obsessed with language. I also found her to be rather obsessed with some aspects of church history. I learned more than I needed to know about the Virgin Martyrs and St. Maria Goretti. Like some of the other reviewers on this site I was hoping to learn more about life in a monastery. Some of the human interest stories she tells towards the end of the book are moving and make me wish for more. The beautiful examples of holiness and long-suffering on the deathbeds of people she has known meant more to me than hearing about how many wounds Maria Goretti received when she was murdered.In fact I wouldn't suggest that this book be kept by the bedside for nighttime reading because some parts are quite disturbing for reading at anytime but particularly as bedtime spiritual reading.I feel as though Kathleen Norris wondered if she'd ever again write a book and thinking perhaps that this was her last chance--she filled it with all kinds of material from both the past and present. At least one reviewer commented that she wasn't focused--it did seem as though my mind was flying in every direction trying to keep up with her meanderings. Only occasionally did I feel inspired or uplifted. I honestly wonder how relevant some of this material is to the average Christian who just needs a spiritual pick-me-up and a peek inside the monastery walls. ",3.0

" While appreciating what Helen Hunt Jackson was trying to do with Ramona there are some aspects of the book which truly bother me. One can't help but wonder at her glossed over hisoricaly nostaligic view of the mission system in California. The Native Americans who were in this system were kept in virtual bondage and horribly abused both physicaly and sexualy and were forced to give up the lifestyles that they had known. I think Ramona has good intention but like Uncle Tom's Cabin the book it was modeled after suffers from a severe case of historical nostalgia. It is however interesting to read the book from a modern perspective in the sense that reform literature has certanly changeg over the years! A good read just beware of the hisorical inacuracies.

" I admit it...I never in a million years would have read Ramona if not forced to do so by my history professor for a class in race & ethnicity in American History. However having said that I found the book a thoroughly enjoyable read...overdramaticized yes but we can forgive it when we consider the original date of publication. However it is the story behind the story that is most interesting. What Ramona truly is....a middle class white woman's perception of what it might be like to be an Indian. Jackson was an abolitionist turned author in the 1830's. This is her most recognized and extensive work. So the next time you read it if you read between the lines you will see HER innate prejudices and assumptions. Butlike I said I enjoyed it immensely and reccomend it as a fun read...but don't take it too literally...it is after all fiction ",3.0
" I actually read a 1908 edition of this book but this was as close as I could find. I found Ramona to be a pretty good story but had trouble understanding why it was said to have been monumental in bringing changes to the government's treatments of Native Americans or why it apparently received such myth like status in certain parts of Southern California. I was raised in or had family in nearly all of the territory mentioned in Ramona (which ranges from San Fransisco all the way down to Mexico). I had never heard mention of the story until a local book dealer here in NC offered me a copy of it. It was only recently that I got around to reading it and I did like how well the book describes all the mountainous terrain I grew up in and miss so much particularly the mention of manzanita trees which are so beautiful but are only indigenous to that area. Also the mention of all the missions particularly the one in San Diego I visited so often was a nice mental vacation back home.Outside of the background I was excited to read this book that was suppose to have been so life changing for the Native American people as half my family falls in that category. Unfortunately I was not struck by anything earth shattering. Jackson does talk about the government's early allowances of whites basically claiming public domain over the natives' homes and lands which was definitely tragic but the true horror of what really happened at that time never really reaches the level it needs to to be moving. You would gain more from reading pure historical accounts or textbooks or visiting native area museums near the reservations. I found Ramona to be more of a love story than anything and even the love story was sweet but again just short of really moving. Ramona herself goes through mental and physical maturity and it was nice to see her grow with each experience throughout the story but her love Alessandro struck me as mostly annoying to be honest. It seemed he spent all of his time in constant outrage whining paranoia melodramatic smoochy love talk with Ramona or just bat crazy. Granted his people had been through some hell but even when things were good for him Alessandro just never struck me as a real man secure in himself and I wondered what Ramona was fawning all over. Even Ramona at one point makes a comment that she jumped to hear Alessandro laugh because it was so rare.I saw one reviewer on another of edition of this book mention that it seemed that Jackson was trying to write how she assumed the Native Americans spoke and acted. That is definitely the impression I got too. Particularly with Alessandro but with many of the Native characters they would either sound White-influenced or Mexican-influenced in their speech and behavior but never really Native American to me. Jackson's 'Indian' dialog reminded me of the way they would make Tonto speak in the old Lone Ranger movies. Not to mention that Natives (at least the men lol) are not so open with their emotions and feelings even with wives. There is a guardedness and stoicism that just wasn't well portrayed here.Like I said Ramona is pretty good to get an idea of the Southern California landscape and there are some great interesting characters - Ramona herself and especially the sassy Aunt Ri (though her deep Appalachian dialect makes for tough reading-at certain parts it goes on for pages!). The love story between Alessandro and Ramona is cute and bittersweet and you do feel for them through their joys and tribulations but overall it just wasn't QUITE as moving as I was hoping for. ",3.0

" Endless Love was an everyday love story about teenage love. Yet it was here that both lead actors got their big break. Well we all know what happened to Brooke Shields. She now stars in her own sitcom Suddenly Susan. As for David who went on to pursue smaller roles such as portraying a reverend-turned-werewolf in Steven King's Silver Bullet you could say that things did not turn out to be quite as well for him. Overall although both actors intended to shoot for the stars their performance can best be described as well...jaded. ",3.0
" Although much maligned this movie isn't that bad. At least I was able to sit all the way through it which I can't say for a lot of more heralded titles. Based on Scott Spencer's novel about teenage love as Pauline Kael has observed it's like the male version of Splendor in the Grass. In Splendor Natalie Wood was so nuts about Warren Beatty that she was packed off to a loony bin. Here Martin Hewett is just as obsessive about Brooke Shields and he's the one who ends up institutionalised. Director Franco Zeffirelli is more interested in presenting the teenagers as modern day Romeo and Juliet and he pulls back on the sex that was rampant in the book. Hewitt and Shields still have sex but it's staged so unerotically that the fact that Shields needs sleeping pills becomes a joke. It can't be that her recreation makes her too hyped to sleep and considering how often they are seen to engage in activity it's a wonder she can stay awake at all. Zefferilli probably equals Spencer's purple-ness in a climactic brawl and with the hysterical performances of Don Murray as Shield's father and Beatrice Straight at Hewitt's mother. As Hewitt's father Richard Kiley is quietly assuming and as Shield's mother Shirley Knight is warm and tender this being one of her last films before she began to gain weight. The 'liberal' household that Knight and Murray share which is meant to be a catalyst for the love that the teenagers are just 'too young to handle' also has odd indications of incest and this prepares us for a later scene where Knight makes a pass at Hewitt. That Hewitt is using Knight to get to her daughter still doesn't seem to shift the shame of an older woman/younger man seduction off Knight and the fact that he had been sleeping with her daughter makes things even more queazy. Thankfully Knight manages to retain her dignity but the point that she is still an attractive woman seems beside the point of Hewitt's rejection. When Hewitt is banned from visiting Shields at her home we wonder why that means he cannot speak to her at school. And when Shields' family have a party we also wonder why Hewitt is not invited. From the glimpses we get of Shields at the party she hardly seems pining for her 'endless love' partner so we are apt to believe the information Hewitt has overheard - that the couple have broken up and the implication being that Shields is again a free agent. These mixed messages culminate in Hewitt confronting Shields and nearly raping her to make her admit she still loves him. Hewitt is required to act more than Shields since his character has more at stake than hers in the narrative and though he falls back on boyish head-lowering and makeup provides him with a masculinising stubble he is convicing when he cries in the rain. Shields however is used like a model. Cinematographer David Watkin captures her at what may be the height of her beauty a standard Shields has been unable to rise above in her adult years. This film also features James Spader in one of his early snooty roles as Shields' brother and a beefy Tom Cruise in one scene. ",3.0

The entire film is amateurishly done though I would give it an A for effort if that really mattered. The filmmakers were trying to make a thriller about an extremely mysterious young woman and the movie accomplishes that. Also the energy almost makes up for the lack of talent and quality. However the subtext concerning 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' is an interesting idea better left on the drawing board and the script could have used some tightening. Fans of horror films have grown accustomed to low budgets because films in the genre are rarely taken seriously. After watching films such as this one can understand why. Nonetheless a low budget is not an excuse to produce a low quality film. Filmmakers must work within their budgets and not provide signs that indicate any limitations. Lack of a budget doesn't bother me but the filmmakers must have realized how ridiculous the effects at the end of the movie looked. To be taken more seriously they could have revised the ending to avoid these effects. The fact these effects were left in the movie indicate to me this movie is meant to be fun not earnest. Taken for what it is it really isn't awful. ",3.0
" This book is an attempt to create SPAC Soil Plant Atmosphere Continuum. But looks more like a series of lecture notes. Written in clear manner covering aspects of water in soil plant and atmosphere. Each chapter also has a brief biography of famous person responsible in the topic discusses from Richards to Nielsen Hertz Boltzmann etc. Also contained instruments and anecdote behind them such as how disc permeameter evolved and patented.In Chapter 2 the author stressed the importance of using SI units. But other chapters still use non SI units eg. dynes/cm3 bar.The author tries to incorporate many modern instruments but some classical methods and theories still used. such as using wheatstone bridge to measure conductivity and electrical analogue.

" I am German and this is the first German movie I have EVER seen in the theaters! It was also my last one because it didn't live up to my expectations - even though critics reported it was the best German movie ever... Anyway the best part of the moive are the first 2 minutes (the preface). The idea itself is quite exciting but strictly speaking the movie is just 30 minutes long and is repeated over and over again with vario9us scenarios... it get's very boring after a couple of minutes. Only the theme keeps you interested. It is not an action film it is no thriller no horror no satire I don't know what it is but I wouldn't go for this one. ",3.0

" With all the critics out there praising this movie from beginning to end I just couldn't help but be a little curious. So I purchased it hoping that it would at least live up to half the hype. Well for all it's worth Lola doesn't lack anything in the style department as promised. The critics weren't kidding when they said it had stunning visuals a pulse pounding soundtrack and a pace only a cheetah could catch up with. Unfortunately it just plays out like an extended MTV music video. The plot starts off interesting and easy enough but the twist and turns all end in such a predictable and almost rushed way. Almost like the director gave up on the last half of the movie. Sure I like the whole 'cause and effect' feel but it could've been polished more. To keep it simple Run Lola Run is a roller coaster ride of a movie with adrenaline pumping speed . Just be forwarned it's not for everybody. ",3.0
" I challenge anyone to fall asleep watching this movie! The combination of the techno-beat soundtrack and Lola running feels like it should be as bad for you as looking directly at strobe lighting. The main idea behind the movie has been done many times before - having the chance to re-live the same day again to reach a different conclusion. The director shows us how coincidence and chance affect outcomes. This isn't a film for realists fans of great dialogue or character development. But if you think you would enjoy watching a movie that grabs you by your senses and shakes you up you could do a lot worse. ",3.0
" Run Lola Run. The first time I watched this flick (which is a in my own personal DVD collection) I wasn't blown away. There's allot of hype about the flick how great the movie is how mind blowing the music is blah blah blah... and with the advice Flavor Flave gave us all about 'the hype' I didn't believe it. Instead I went out and bought it because I was curious. The plot? Girl runs to save boyfriend. That's it. It was like 'Groundhog Day' on ecstasy. I'll give it credit for being original. I'll give it credit for knotting up all the details. I'll give it credit for energy as it had a lot... but in the end I was rather bored with the ending. It kind of fell off. The music house music which you can find in most new age independent films. Watch it in German with the subtitles because the English dub is so over-acted it makes it look ridiculous. You'll enjoy it more in German as I did... the second time. ",3.0
" This movie is overrated by people who might have found the movie's concept really really cool. I think this movie doesn't provide much beside its original....(daring)screenplay.

" This movie explores the variations that affect our day. Most of the time small changes wouldn't mean much. But when life is on the line one small change can have a profound impact on the following decisions events and coincidents. This movie is brave enough to show them taking a page from Rashomon which shows the same events from 3 different perspectives.However where this movie lost me was caring for the characters. The boyfriend whose life is on the line is a gangster a drug dealer. Why would I care if he lives or dies? So he can poison the youth later on?Overall the DVD is average. There's not many extras but it is a 2-sided DVD that has both widescreen and full-screen versions (for those of you that like to miss 40% of the movie). This movie may worth a watch not much more.

" I read someone else's suggestion that this German film would inspire Hollywood to copy it. It would if it were that original. I have seen this idea done twice already in America. The first was a short film about a man who was unable to avoid repeating the same few moments in his life for an entire day. The documentary-like film had no stars. The next thing I knew Bill Murray was starring in Ground Hogs Day an almost complete replication of the short film I had seen earlier. The short film isn't particularly a comedy the Murray film is.Run Lola Run is not a comedy either. Its a film about a girl who has 20 minutes to save her boyfriend from robbing a store. Manni Lola's boyfriend needs 100000 in 20 minutes to pay his bosses back for money he has left on the subway train. His life will be forfeit if he is unable to pay this money to the men he works for as a courier. Three times Lola runs in order to help her boyfriend. Each time the scenes are largely replicated but there are minor differences in timing. These differences result in major differences in what happens. I'm not going to tell you why the sequence repeats three times or how it comes out.Suffice to say that the film technique here is extreme razzle- dazzle. I don't think there has ever been a German film with this much heavy production and effects. Mostly we see Lola traversing a German city going from one building to another across one scenic plaza after another running at full speed. In each rerunning of 3 very similar scenarios her encounters with people places and objects are just slightly off. The minor changes in time make for major differences in what happens.I have to tell you the film was an obvious formula with too few variations to excite me much. Some might like it. I didn't think it was as much a story as it was a production. I wouldn't recommend it. Its wonderful filmmaking but very poor story-telling. ",3.0
" I don't like to disagree with the friend who lent me the DVD of this movie. I always appreciate the foreign cinema. Since I was stationed in Germany for six years with the U.S. Army and had a few German friends who would occasionally visit me I was always looking for good German-language films. Belonging to a family of people who appreciate films I knew the major classics of the German Expressionist period and the Sternberg-Dietrich collaborations but I needed something newer to keep young German friends interested.Run Lola Run is very showy but it lacks depth. Now I don't disagree with other people who like this movie very much--the last thing I want is for people to think of me as hostile--but needs something to care about--a reason to exist--where the zippy photography and inter-cut animated segments would ultimately mean something. Run Lola Run seems to me to be a very shallow film. Except for this the film was very good. The film is successful at adapting a certain aura of contemporary German society the same side that like many of us Americans watch a lot of daytime television; I only intend a deduction.As always I recommend the following German films",3.0

" Run Lola Run has a very different style of directing - fast motion panning shots intersparsed with dark slow scenes intended to draw out the viewer's emotion. I have to give credit where credit is due and in that regard Run Lola Run is something completely different.In the same breath (and without giving any spoilers) the main premise of the movie is one you won't soon forget.But even with the unique directing style the definitive concept of the story and the good performances by the cast there's something lacking about this film. I couldn't feel the characters I couldn't put myself in their shoes. I couldn't find a reason to feel sad or happy even though there were several scenes where the director's intent was to do just that. The movie lacked depth and emotion.If you're a film student and you want to see a different style of directing see this movie. If you find enjoyment in watching something new plot twists rarely seen before see this movie. But if your enjoyment in movies comes from emotion and passion feeling the characters and experiencing the story with your mind AND your heart this movie isn't for you. ",3.0

" Tom Tykwer`s 'Run Lola Run' is a breath of fresh air. There is so much creativity and vision in this small film that it stands alone against the overblown star vehicles the major studios keep forcing upon us. It is a film brimming with energy and inspiration and a powerful salvo against Hollywood conventionalism.Lola (Franka Potente) is told by her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) that he has lost a bag with 100000 deutsche marks in it. She realizes that he will most likely be killed if the money is not delivered to the gangster Manni was supposed to meet. This realization starts Lola off on a quest to come up with the funds on her own. With time running out Lola bolts out of her apartment and runs . . . and runs . . . and runs . . .'Run Lola Run' is a treatise on the infinite possibilities a single situation can spawn. It is a metaphysical examination of how the choices we make will affect us forever and how the actions of others can profoundly influence the circumstances of our lives. Yet on a more simplistic level it is also an energetic display of filmmaking at its most creative. Its unique use of freeze frames novel camera angles instant replays and animation is proof that Tykwer is determined to give us a viewing experience unlike anything we've ever seen before. With a pulsating soundtrack and a bravura performance by Potente to complement his boundless creativity Tykwer succeeds in creating a truly original work. Here's hoping that his example will inspire the current generation of filmmakers to test their own creative limits in the hopes of surpassing the standard set by 'Run Lola Run.' ",3.0

" It would not be correct to say The Autumn series is a Romero-fan's ultimate zombie series but its not fair to say its 'the thinking man's' zombie series either.If you worked your way through Autumn and its sequel The City you pretty much know what you're getting. Some occassional grisle and gore but mostly a lot of complaining and 'didnt-we-already-go-over-this' dialogue. Still I know I was at least invested enough to see how things turn out. The sadist in me wanted more of the survivors to get mauled by the hordes but the Lost fan in me was interested to see how the ending would develop from here.Most of the most annoying characters have been weeded out by now so you know that you won't get too many 'what's the point' speakers from here on in but you still get your gaggle of quitters and whiners which would be fine if it weren't every other conversation.The scenes at the airport are certainly intense and make for the most thrilling in the series since the farmhouse stand-off on the first book.The Autumn series did just-enough blood/guts/gore to keep me invested the characters were interesting at time annoying at others and Moody's reliance on describing the state of decay on the zombies became less powerful the more and more he did it. By then he needed to raise the bar and emotional resonance by sacrificing a few more brave souls in a gruesome demise. ",3.0

" I have read and reviewed the first 2 'Autumn' books and I am probably sounding like a broken record. There is not enough of the over-the-top Zombie gore that I enjoy so much. There is however more action in this book than the first two in the series.The books are well written and interesting. The problem I have besides the absence of extreme Zombie gore is that the books focus mainly on the characters. The Zombies almost seem secondary to the story.I enjoyed all three books but this was my favorite so far. The suspense is tight throughout almost the entire book. You get a possible explanation of what may have caused most of the world's population to die. The Zombies are more violent than ever and the feeling of despair is at an all time high. Then the mood changes there may be hope!These books wouldn't be my first choice in the Zombie genre but they are entertaining. The story does lure you into wanting to know how it all ends. I have read the first three in the series and plan to read all five books. ",3.0

" This book will save your life? Were I a book club I'd say instead welcome this author when she cruises your way but don't necessarily trawl the Amazon to find her.Homes has ticked the right boxes on her resume. She attended Iowa Writers' Workshop belongs to Yaddo artists' community and teaches at Columbia University and the New School in New York. Her first novel Jack came at age 19. Her story collection The Safety of Objects inspired Rose Troche's film of 2001.Adopted at birth Homes recently documented the disappointing discovery of her biological parents. Maybe that resolved the personal trauma but what of the national trauma? Twin towers still loom as the pachyderm in the parlour of American fiction the gatecrasher that American writers struggle to overcome.The previous Homes novel dates from 1999. This one distances the setting to Los Angeles. It subverts the unspeakable via the menacing sinkholes wildcats wildfires and earthquakes known to monster that city. It introduces the rich but disconnected Richard Novak jolted by an 'incredible pain' he cannot identify.Show don't tell harp the sages of fiction. On the first two pages Homes tells us twice. 'Everything today is not the same and yet it is exactly the same and can never be the same again.' Followed hard by 'After years of making sure that he is left alone he is suddenly afraid to be alone afraid not to feel not to notice.'Surviving his opening bout of incredible pain Novak rapidly makes the acquaintance of an immigrant doughnut man a helpful quack doctor a 'crying woman in the produce section' a personable movie star who lives up the road and a famous author gone to ground. The 911-emergency operator recognises his voice after the reporting of his incidentally showy good deeds. During which time his semi-estranged New York son is driving closer and closer to Los Angeles.Such a concatenation of threats and disasters among the economically and racially diverse citizens of Los Angeles echoes the disguised feel-good of the Academy-awarded movie Crash. There is in Novak's accidental-tourist wanderings a refreshing undercurrent of making it right a healing serendipity. Once again things tend to be underlined. When our Good Samaritan shames the doctor's waiting room into helping an old lady Homes wills him to lecture the group 'That's the point isn't it?'The endpapers acknowledge another Amy H. long-time Homes supporter Amy Hempel. She is a mordant miniaturist whose seemingly innocuous stories sometimes conceal a black undertow. Meanwhile Homes makes benign observations like 'Driving a Bentley to Target-only in L.A. does this make perfect sense' and 'America has two kinds of politician-one has sex the other has war'.To make something great out of her good material Homes maybe needed to stretch out and suffer more. If not quite up for that level of literary sacrifice and rebirth she does offer something intriguing.(Canberra Times September 9 2006) ",3.0
" Here's the message of A. M. Homes' novel-get your head out of your woo woo and look around. Protagonist Richard Novak represents that unfortunate trend of people who are so impressed with their own self-importance that they have edited nearly everyone out of their lives. Richard has done just that so when he is overwhelmed by mysterious and extraordinary pain there is no one to pick him up from the hospital. Shaken by how he has cut himself off from everyone save those whose services he pays for he sees the importance of change. When he starts to pay attention to someone other than himself things begin to happen.Homes has set her novel in Los Angeles which is an easy shot. Bustling with immigrants from places ranging from Oman to Omaha and subject to a shifting landscape that seems mysterious to outsiders it's an easy place to pick for such crises of being. In fact 'This Book Will Save Your Life' should be made up of harder choices. It's charming it goes down yes easily and its message of open your eyes is a good one. But what of it were set in another city or even a town that doesn't have the built-in joke factor of LA? Richard is so rich and has filled his life with so much macrobiotic kitsch that it is hard to recognize him our regular lives-even in the guy whose cell call is so important that he can't be bothered to greet the barrista at Starbucks.And then once he does try to connect with other people they are an exceptionally colorful crew. No one is as dismissive of him as the old Richard would have been to them. Even the crankiest-the woman he meets sobbing in a supermarket-gives him a chink to get in.This is a warmhearted enjoyable novel but I want to see a darker deeper treatment of how we got to be in this fix.

The idea of a self-absorbed stock trader being shaken out of his rutted life and finding the joy and satisfaction in helping others is certainly promising.

As Richard (don't call me Dick) Novak goes through his life interacting with a movie star a crying woman a reclusive writer a kidnapped woman and various city functionaries concerning his sinkhole we never find out how he feels about any of the odd events happening to him!When Ben his son enters the story the emotions improve but not to a satisfactory level in my opinion.

" The audio book version of This Book Will Save Your Life (by A.M. Homes) benefits from the fine reading given it by Scott Brick. That Brick manages to give so many eccentric characters a distinctly recognizable tone of voice is in fact remarkable. And because these characters are the best thing the novel has going for it Brick's contribution is particularly important to one's overall perception of the novel.The book opens just as Richard Novak is suffering through a life-changing experience. He is on the phone with a rather blase 911 operator who insists on methodically interviewing him about the pain he his experiencing rather than taking his word that he needs immediate help. The pain so bad that Richard is even unsure precisely where he hurts does ultimately land him in a Los Angeles emergency room. The Richard Novak that emerges from that emergency room will not be the same man who entered it.Prior to his painful reawakening Richard was content with his life of relative ease and isolation. He lived alone working the stock market from his expensive home totally dependent upon the services of a daily housekeeper/cook and personal trainer to keep him going. The problem as he sees it now is that he is close to no one including the teenage son he barely knows.Richard's need to reconnect with humanity will lead him to a series of bizarre experiences involving those he encounters over the next few days.

" These grew fine in our basement. I was under the impression that we would have multiple harvests but the literature states two maybe three. That's a lot of cash for a few bowls of mushrooms. If you do have expendable income they are delicious. ",3.0
" I had a hard time growing these. Firstly you're suppose to keep it in the refrigerator to grow however the size of the block of soil they give you is SO BIG that there is no way it would ever fit in our 'frig (also because you need room on top for these to place the plastic hood and they sprout up rather high). It would be good if they sold them in smaller blocks like 1/2 or 1/3 the size so people could accommodate them in their refrigerators. They never really grew properly and always looked sparse and sickly. However to the company's credit they offered to replace it so that shows me they are honest. For that reason I give them 3 stars instead of 2. If they sold these in smaller packages for people with not much room in their fridge then I would give it 4 stars because I am SURE these probably grow much better in the fridge and I would've had better success had I been able to put them there. The smaller package would be easier to grow and a more affordable price (they'd probably even sell more too).

" The story starts out showing how children are left to fend for themselves and try to make adult decisions. A fire is started and kills one of the children showing how no matter what the circumstance a child is left to act like it only knows how to. The counch shell is also introduced and will be a 'telephone' for the children and also a sign of power later in the novel. I wasn't to impressed with the slow developments of the first 2 chapters there was alot of focus put on the children and not enough time spent describing the setting. The characters were highly detailed. Piggy is introduced almost as the adult figure while there is Ralph who is more the neutral party and Jack who is the complete opposite of Piggy. They introduce Simon to be like the conscience figure of the group stating how the only beast on the island was the boys themselves. It seems as though Golding attempts to show us almost a battle of good vs evil though out the book until the final chapter as we see the counch being destroyed and Piggy the only one with intelligence being killed. Ralph dodges numerous attacks through out the end chapters to be saved by a navy officer who comes to the island after seeing the smoke. I would have liked to see something happen at the end to the boys who were part of Jacks tribe or at least see something happen to Jack. The story ends with alot of answered questions in my mind on what happens to the boys having something to show us what later because of the boys would have been very nice. The story was fairly easy reading with some exception to the early chapters. There was a definate lack of interesting material. The later chapter from the point of the beating death of Simon to the last chapter was much more action packed and really does a good job of filling your imagination.

It is a book more for people that can read and understand old english. Other wise it is a pretty good book to read. ",3.0

" Lord of the Flies by Sir William Golding is about a group of boys trapped on an island in the middle of nowhere because their plane crashed. Lord of the Flies described how the kids dealt with life on the island with no adults and no sign of rescue in sight.Lord of the Flies is an interesting book. It has great interaction among the characters especially between Ralph and Jack. Ralph is an athletic kid. He believes in order and building a civilization on the island. That is why Jack and he fight. Jack is a strong-willed kid. He believes that the best way to run the island is just go hunt and turn in the rest of the castaways into savages. Ralph was the original leader of the tribe Jack however did not like how Ralph was leading and he started his own tribe. The two tribes did not get along and that made the story interesting.I enjoyed the way the boys learned to survive on the island by hunting and getting their own food. Jack's tribe hunting the boar down was quite exciting. However I did not enjoy the ending of the book. The story ended too abruptly and almost ruined the book for me. The book also would have been better if it had told more about the happenings. All in all Lord of the Flies was good book but because of the ending was disappointing. That is why I rate it 3 out of 5. ",3.0
" I thought that the book Lord of the Flies a an okay book I would not say that it was the best book that I ever read. The reason that I liked this book was that Golding did a good job of making the book and allegory and he used the characters to show human nature how it can be good but mostly savage. I would think that people that like this book are the people that like to read story for the deep meaning and not have everything told to them and use their imagination when they are reading a story. So overall I thought that Lord of the Flies was an okay book. ",3.0
" I think the book wasn't believable enough to relate it to anyones life. Yes it does have its points about life but all in all it isn't realistic. I think the author's(William Golding) purpose for writing this book was to state the theme that 'there is a need for civilization and rules.' I do agree with him. The book's high points are the events that happen when there is no civilization or rules. Murder theft and violence are all products of no civilization and that is shown in the book. The best literary element in this book is the characters. Golding described his characters to the max. You knew what a character was thinking when he said something or did something. The good characters were so innocent and pure. While on the hand the evil characters were some of the worst people I've ever read about. The reader also loved to hate the evil ones they do things that get on your last nerve. I don't think this book is believable. In the book the children have to deal with events and situations that a thirty year old man would have trouble trying to solve. Children of the age of twelve or younger break into groups because of who stole the toy or the video game not about how they should live or whether or not a childs schedule fits their lifestyle. Bottom line is that the book was good but has it's flaws. ",3.0
" [This is an old review lost in the amazonian jungle now reposted at the request of the Lord of the Gadflies.]The two boys we meet on the first page of 'Lord of the Flies' Ralph and Piggy are as freshly minted as Adam in the Garden or the earth/ice gods of Greek and Norse mythology. Born full-formed they are pre-modern utterly unsurprised by their own existence. They are no more plausible as 12-year-old boys than the usual totemic first humans of 'creation myths' from cultures around the world. Plausibility is not the objective of myth; moral instruction is and 'Lord of the Flies' is plainly intended as a morality tale illustrative of human nature which is depicted as innately savage held in check only by authoritarian social structures and above all by 'rules'.Reading 'Lord of the Flies' as a version of Genesis does make the story clearer though I make no claim that such clarity was William Golding's intention. But",3.0
" Maybe it's the fact that I am around 40 years old and I should have read it when I was 15 - but I couldn't really connect with the story. By the time it finished I did not really care too much about what happened to each of them - Piggy Ralph Jack or anyone else.I suspect it is the fact that I could not believe the story as a whole - lots of little kids living on a deserted island surviving on fruit.It is quite well written though.

" I've put off reading this book for awhile. No reason really I had heard good things about it that it was full of symbolism etc. So now I've finally gotten around to reading it and while I do admit it was chock full of symbolism I didn't find it particularly engrossing and even a bit dull.After a wreck a group of boys twelve years and younger are stranded on an island. From the first they are eager to make their own society without the yoke of adults while still secretly yearning to be rescued. A boy named Ralph is made head of this society with Jack a leader of a choir group turned hunters as his somewhat second in command. He also has a somewhat adviser dubbed Piggy who owns a pair of glasses that is the main source for creating fire. As the boys live on the island their society starts to deteriorate and fears make the boys do things that no one would have ever thought them capable.Ralph is a weird leader for the group. He seems in the beginning to be more along the same lines of personality as Jack. A bully in a way but really just a normal boy otherwise. Piggy is the typical picked on kid who has aspects of him that are important to share but are ignored by society based on superficial reasoning. And Jack well he's the type that's filling up our prisons or operating under camouflage as a socio-path in the normal world. It's just in this world he is allowed to have the savagery come out. Ralph's experience with leading causes him to miss the socio-pathic role but he could have come very close if he had made a few decisions in a different way. And then there's Simon who's supposed to be the enigma of the group but who's really just a sick little boy that is looked at differently because of his issues.Golding uses this book to show a number of things. The bleakness in society the potential for violence in anyone and that without consequences to rules society could fall apart quite easily. But there were a couple things I didn't understand. For one I never really realized why it was all boys that were stranded on the island especially since they weren't all traveling as part of the group like the choir was. Why did they go to savagery so quickly? Especially when you consider the amount of younger kids. And what about their feelings of home and wanting to get back there? Surely after a week or so the fun of playing on their own island would have abated and a depression would have set in. And that just seems unaccounted for. While I thought Golding made some good points about society and how it works I just think it could have been fleshed out more.And the writing itself. For all the violence and gore I found it dull. Just the style was hard to follow because of the way it jumped about. And while part of that can be attributed to following the actions of young boys it was just jarring to read and made it easy to lose focus. And I know this book could actually be geared to middle school and high school aged children but I wonder if the majority have the ability to really get at all the symbolism in this book or if they'll be so distracted by the gore that it'll be missed. Certainly there are some very intelligent kids out there that will get it but not everyone is like that. Heck I'm an adult and I probably didn't catch half of what Golding put in there.There are some lessons in here but it just wasn't the right platform for me. I didn't like Golding's writing style and it caused me to hurry through a book that should have time spent on it to get at the detail.Lord of the FliesCopyright 1954182 pagesReview by M.

" I read this book in 6th grade as part of an 'advanced' program. I wish I hadn't read it quite that early; I might have enjoyed it more. I found it hard to get past the graphic descriptions of blood and gore and to the meat of the story. I do suggest it however; it seemed like an interesting book. (Being a 6th grade girl I wasn't so into the 'blood and gore more and more' thing.)It does contain some disturbing subject matter so it's probably not for kids. (Mature 8th graders and above would be my recommendation.) All in all though Golding describes what happens when society falls apart very vividly and portrays the savageness of humanity gone wrong very well. ",3.0
" The author's purpose for writing this book is to send a message to the readers. I agree with his message because it informs you of how cruel people can be. I think the literary element the author handled best was the characters. They were very well described by their looks as well as their actions. This book was believable because the way the story was written because it has real personalities as real people. For example when people are in a group they change to fit in just like the characters in the story they all became savages. This book was 'less than perfect' because it didn't have any girls and the ending was not very elaborate either. I would fix the flaws by adding more things like girls to see how they would react and be more elaborate in the ending. If I were to rate this book it would be fair. ",3.0
" I think the author was trying to say that without rules there would be total chaos.Thats just like if there was no rules in school there would be total chaos.

I would probably change the part when simon was talking to the pigs head though.It could sound a little more realistic. ",3.0
" In the book Lord of the Flies Golding is trying to show how evil comes out of people when they fear the unknown. I agree with the message he is trying to send out to the readers because people are scared of what they don;t know and sometimes handle it in a crazy behavior. I think he handled the characters very well because you can see how different they are from each other and how much evil they they have in themselves.

The type of person that I think that would like the book the most is the adventurous type.I think the purpose for writing the book was to show that without authority there would be total chaos. I agree with the message because when the kids got used to not having a parental figure around they did what they wanted. The element that was handled best was the climax because of how detailed he explained every thing that was going on. This book was very believable because you're always hearing about people getting into plane crashes and they were standed on an island for a long period of time and they had to use a lot of survival skills.The book was less than perfect because in the middle of action Golding jumps to something totally different. I would fix these flaws by continuing until the action is over. All in all this book was an ok book to read. ",3.0
" This book was really great and I would suggest to my friends to read this book. At first I didn't like it but when everything started happening I really started to enjoy the book. My teacher also made the book very fun to read becasue she put alot of energy into it. The more energy you use to read the book the better it is. The only thing I disagreed with in the book was that Ralph was the leader. I thought with the help of RalphPiggy would have been the best leader because he was the smartest one in the group. I also think Golding did a good job writing this book. He used alot of themes that are in society todayand made me think what if something like that could happen what would it be like. Trust me if you read this book you will be very impressed. One Love and Peace Out!! ",3.0
" The Lord of the Flies portrays the wicked sinful nature of man. In the beggining of the tale the boys are proper and organized. As it progresses however the boys become blood thirsty murderers. Ralph is the leader of the civilized tribe but later loses control to Jack. Jack's tribe hunts for food and has a fort while Ralph tries to keep a smoke signal alive. Jack's tribe kills two of Ralph's friends and plans to kill Ralph...This book shows the evil nature of man and how it can easily get out of control. ",3.0
" I don't know how somebody could live with themselves if they believe the message of this book. Lord of the Flies is brilliantly written and chocked full of symbolism.

" Lord of the flies shows perfectly the dynamics of a group of military schoolboys. Changing as the line of command deteriorates. When they are put on the island after a plane crash. At first they follow reason make a signal fire collect food make shelter so that if there is a storm they will have somewhere to go. The two main powers are Ralph and jack. Ralph seems to the others to be a constricting adult. He pressures them to work and collect fruit tend to the fire instead of running around and playing games on the beach or hunting pigs to eat. Jack is the solution to this he offers a separate tribe to join instead. They paint their faces hide in wait of pigs and develop strategies to track them down. Eventually tempted by the new power most of the boys move over to jacks tribe because they are sick of work and want meat instead of fruit to eat. When there are only a few left with Ralph. Ralph and piggy try to confront the lack of interest in getting rescued also piggy needs his glasses back. There is a scene where piggy gets a rock dropped on him and Ralph fights with jack. As a spear glances off his side Ralph turns and runs to hide in a thick thorn bush the next day when they hunt him. His friends who were forced into the other tribe betray him and before he can be smoked out he breaks their ranks. Later he hides under another bush in a shadow but Rodger finds him. As they chase Ralph shelters are bursting into flame.The ending leaves you hanging you don't really know what is going to happen I didn't really like that though you do get to just make it up yourself. They kill each other. Piggy Simon and one other a boy with a mark on his face goes missing early on. As soon as the navel officer is on the beach they just stop forget that they are all savages or perhaps they remember that killing is wrong and they should have been organized. With the words' what have you been doing?' they all change. Also the torture of am and Eric with spears into joining the tribe and leaving Ralph by himself.The whole book Ralph and Jack are fighting each other this seems to be more of the storyline then the obvious one of boys being stuck on an island and what they do. It Seems that its the fight between their morals and hope on being rescued. Ralph gets his hope from piggy and Jack to help ease the pain of never being rescued starts the tribe of hunters. Then he can take out his pain on tracking the pigs and learning the art of hunting.Lastly Simon talking to a pigs head is just plain weird and i can understand why they take it out of the book for the movie except that this is the only reason that the book is called lord of the flies.

" Again another book tagged as an 'enduring classic' is to be blunt a disspointment and at many times a horrible bore. I myself do not really appreciate the writing stlye of Golding. It seemed to me all of his quotes ended like this-- This was very frustrating to read giving me the feeling more was to be said but was never written often bringing me off track while i was reading trying to wonder what the character was trying to say and i would realize i had read a page or 2 and had not the slightest clue of what i read. Another problem that i found within this book was the sheer number of unimportant characters the continually are mentioned. Characters with no background or character development are often named making me feel as though i missed something again taking me off track of my reading. Overall the story itself has an interesting idea in my opinion this interesting story is quite frankly ruined by the poor quality of Golding's writing. A frustrating read filled with obscure as well as obvious symbollism I would not recommend it. ",3.0

" William Golding's 'Lord of the Flies' is about a group of young children stranded on an uninhabited island who are forced to create their own civilization and survive. The novel while somewhat predictable and easy to understand is filled with many important uses of symbolism. In the opening Piggy finds a conch shell and uses it to bring order to the group and the conch shell continues to symbolize order throughout the novel. However when Piggy is killed later on in the novel the conch shell is destroyed also symbolizing the end of order. The 'Lord of the Flies' a severed pig's head symbolizes the cruelty and brutality that the members of Jack's group possess. Throughout the novel there are many parallels that are made between the boy's civilization on the island and civilization as a whole. This novel is easy to read right through and not fully understand its entire purpose but I believe William Golding's purpose for this novel is to provide an understanding of the evils of civilization and government.

" My Thoughts on 'Lord Of The Flies' Is that it brings so much insight and can help us understand ourselves better. The story is so great; it shows how nature and man can combine together and accomplish good or evil. Golding brings these kids on this island where they will have to face many challenges and fight with life and death.He brings mankind and civilization together and makes the island like a war against nature. My opinion is when he creates the plots and description of the story he describes the characters and the island and the plots so well. I like how he makes the story like giving us a sigh of the world we live in today on how the world can be so cruel and evil but the outcome of it can be very good. Overall this was a very great book.

" Golding's purpose for writing this story was he meant to send a message out to the readers. He wanted to let us know what it would be like to be free without rules and authority. I think Golding handled setting and symbolism best out of all the literary elements in the book. He described the island so good it makes you visualize what it looks like. Golding also used lots of symbolism helping to explain why certain things happened in the story. Golding wanted to show how young boys would react to being alone and in charge of themselves. It is a good book and enjoyable..I encourage you to read it if you like semi adventure and realism. ",3.0

" Lord of the Flies is brilliant of that there is no doubt. It's painfully realistic and I have no doubt that events on Golding's little fictional Pacific island could have unfolded exactly the way he led them to unfold.

" The book 'Lord of the Flies' is a very interesting book. This book has it ups and downs. I think that the only way that you would be able to enjoy this book is if you start thinking deeper into the story. I liked this book because you can think deeper into it and it makes sense and it explains a lot. If you think deeper into the story then you can enjoy the book so much more.This book is pretty much a allegory book. An allegory is a story or tale with two or more levels of meaning-a literal and a symbolic meaning. The characters in the book stand for something else. This is a hard book to understand for that reason. Once you thin it through and think of what the characters could be resembling then you can understand the book more. I didnt understand the book until my teacher started telling the class that the characters stand for something or the symbolize something and then I understood it and got into it a lot more.So if you are looking for a book where it gets you to think and it has a deeper meaning then this is the book for you. If not the I dont think that this book is for you. ",3.0
" When I fisrt heard of the story and of the ideabehind this book I thought it could really be agreat novel. The main idea is to propose a metaphor of what our societies are like but from the point of view of children lost on a desert island. They 'build' their own little society with a chief and people who have to do some tasks if they want to survive. Well the setting sounds really cool doesn't it?That's why I wanted to read this book and I was not compelled to read it by one of my teachers. But when I finished it I was very disappointed. The basic idea is great but the way it is developed is flawed. You just have kids who go crzay and wild because there are no more adults above them to tell them what to do or not. And moreover when trying to show us a bit of what is our history and an insight into the development of our civilizations Golding forget many very important things along the way.As a matter of fact there are no women on the island (or well no little girl to fall in love with).

At first they are successful but in the end they fail miserably. The group splits into savage vs. civil and things get crazy. Although I wouldn't consider this book one of my favorites I liked the way the boys' struggle represents real struggles that go on in the world. There are many themes in this book and in general the book mirrors human nature and the realities of our civilization today. In the end everyone in the book did what made them happy even if it didn't work for the group. Our world today is much like this people are mostly concerned about themselves. There are many conflicts in this book between leaders and followers order and chaos work and play. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes action and conflict.

" Lord of the Flies is a worthwhile book that could have used an editor with just a little more aggressiveness. The first hundred ninety-nine pages are excellent. Golding has wonderful insight into the human condition and he applies it with rare grace and tact. And then we get to the final page which would be best ripped out.

" Lord of the flies was a fairly good book. It is about a group of boys who land on a desserted island after their plane has crashed. No adults had survived the plane wreck so the kids are without any adult supervision.

But they cannot all get along and when Jack starts his own hunting tribe the group of boys split. The boys in Jack's group always wanting to hunt quickly turn into fierce savages. So fierce that others are endangered of being killed.

Through the whole book I wanted them to do things so they could be saved but the majority of them didn't care. ",3.0
" I recommend this book for high school students who enjoy to read. It is a good book for a person who likes a little bit of adventure and some excitement. The one thing I did not like about this book is it does get dull during the middle of the book but it picks up a little bit in the end. It should be a book that you would want to read instead of being forced too. ",3.0
" I'm a student who was just required to read Lord of the Flies. I personally thought the plot was good. I liked the charaters in the book. I think though that maybe the author has a similar problem in writing to myself. I know I get a good idea and cannot write it down the way I want it. I'm sure the original idea was a great one. Maybe if I reread this book at a later time in my life I may be able to like it better. I'm not sure. Over all I'd tell you to read it because its a book about survival from the elements from oneself and contains a large amount of action within its pages. ",3.0
" this novel was extremely intersting and had great symbolism. great choice!! ",3.0
" I think the author was trying to tell us that everyone has some kind of evil inside them. I agree with him because everyone isn't perfect. The best literary element in the book was the characters. I like how each character had its own great personality.It was a believable because without rules crazy things like that can happen. The book could of be better if the begining was so slow and had more action in it. Overall i really liked the book. ",3.0
" Lord of the flies was a book about a group of kids that plain crashes on an island and they get stuck their.The kids have no grownups around so they have to do everything for themslves.They try to establish rules but after a while nobody listens to the rules and all hell breaks out. I think the authors purpose for writing the book was to show how people can turn savage in a short period of time without anyone to enforce the rules.I do agree with his message because society's do need rules or else things like what happened in the book will happen every day. In the book I think that the author handled the characters very well.There were many charactersand he described them and their personality very well.I think Golding is a great author. This book is very believable to me because a plane could crash on a deserted island and kids could have to take care of themselves with no grownups around.It all is possible. I think that Golding did a great job with this book and it is fine how it is written. ",3.0
" The novel The Lord of the Flies by William Golding is a novel in which some boys get stranded on an island and they are trying to find their way off the island. To read this book and completly usnderstand this novel you should and almost have to be a very intellectual person and you have to be a deep person. There is some symbolism that is very difficult to understand and without a teacher or someone who understands the book telling you what it is about it could be very confusing. The book however had very good discription and was very well written. It made you feel like you were actually there with them and feeling their struggles and difficulties. I felt their frustration with each other. Can you imagine if you were stranded on this island and you had no adults no parents and no sense of government? I felt as if the book was never ending and it dragged on way too long. I didn't enjoy reading it therefore I really didn't put a lot of energy trying to figure out what the author was trying to say. I also am not a girl for ficton books and I usually don't like books that we have to read in school. If I were to read this book I would deffenitly go in with a different mind set. I would go in with the mind set that this book is very difficult to read and that I have to foucs a lot to see the hidden symbolism and theme within the book. I enjoyed the scenery that was set up and the discription used to describe events. I recommend this book to anyone who has great understanding finding hidden symbolism and picking out the theme. Be prepared for a some what difficult novel yet thrilling. Be intense while reading this book! ",3.0
" The book Lord of the Flies written by William Golding is a very well written book. The genre of the book is historical fiction. The setting of the book is on an uncharted island during the WorldWarII era. The book is mainly about a couple of schoolboys who crash-landed on an uncharted island that they are stranded on without any adults. I think the theme of the book was to show that society cannot run correctly because of the natural sinful nature of man. Some of the main characters are Piggy Ralph and Jack. Piggy and Ralph first meet when they when they wake up next to each other after the landing. Piggy is a chubby little bossy kid while Ralph on the other hand is a mellow and relaxed cool kind of kid. They call together all of the kids that are on the island including a boy named Jack. Jack is a stuck up kid who is a prefect at his school and is the captain of his choir class. While the short lived bond of Piggy and Ralph's friendship becomes weaker Jack and Ralph who are both leaders seem to get along very well. Piggy and Ralph were friends but when a person like Jack shows up a more strong leader-like and Ralph-like kid is up to be Ralph's friend Ralph quickly ignores Piggy to become Jack's friend. But as Jack and Ralph's friendship grows the contest for leadership of the tribe of kids grows even more. Even though the kids already voted for Ralph to be the chief Jack is starting to show that he could be a better chief. I believe this because all Ralph has ever cared for is to keep the fire going and keep the hope of being rescued alive. While Jack a more ferocious boy focuses on staying alive most of the time and hunting for the hard to get meat. I think that this book is best recommended for older teenagers because most of the words in the book are very complex and because of the violence that happens. The book Lord of the Flies is a very interesting book. Even though it has some very confusing words and hard to understand material it should be given a try. ",3.0
" I read Lord of the Flies one time for school. When I first started reading it I didn't like it that much but I thought it wasn't too bad. Some parts were really interesting but some were boring. I thought it really started to get my attention towards the end when a lot of interesting things started to happen but I didn't really like the first half. If you didn't have to read this when you were in school I would recommend giving it a try. But I suggest to read it all the way through to get the full enjoyment of it though. ",3.0
" Lord of the Flies is a story about sverel young boys who were stranded on an island with no adults. The story tells about how they developed leaders and routine for their lives. It was a well written book although sometimes it was hard to follow. Some portions were a bit disturbing but it kept me entertained and that takes a lot. I'd say this book is like Peter Pan meets Cast Away. It was a wonderful story on adventure and survival. ",3.0
" I didn't know anything about LOTF before I read it except that it was foundational to many other works controversial and highly recommended. As far as a story goes it's engaging. The characters aren't anything special from a literary perspective. I'm not a big person on reading into the symbolism behind everything in a book so much of the appeal and social critique of LOTF was lost on me. Some parts were confusing and I'm still trying to figure out why the title is what it is (the pig head on the pole seemed like a minor incident).At the end I was left with a feeling of 'meh.' But that's just me. If you want fun and adventure you're probably best to look elsewhere. If you want to read a critique of human nature and the fall of society you've got it. If you haven't read this 'classic' and need to check it off your list enjoy. ",3.0
" When I started reading this book I was happy to look for adventure of a bunch of young kids/men stranded on an island without any support or knowledge of survival instincts. Then the story takes a turn by showing how human behavior creates anger jealousy and hunger for control. The key of the book is how do people react when left to survive without controls governments aka survival in nature.The writing style is smart vivid and exceptionally detailed. The author describes every movement colour geography and person in detail.The plan is simple- put kids from various backgrounds in order to get a bag full of characters possible.Read this to realise how we end up behaving when there is no control and the dark side our human mind is capable off ",3.0
" In my seventh grade English class we have just finished reading a great book called Lord of the Flies by William Golding. He wrote this book with unbelievable description which would either catch your eye or put you to sleep in class. For me it was more like putting myself to sleep. That doesn't mean it wasn't a good book I just think it was in my opinion a book more for adults. Besides the description the plot was well written. I enjoyed how he used Piggy to get the theme across.Mr. Golding put lots of thought into the book when writing description. From describing the ocean blue all the way to describing Piggy's looks and attitudes. Examples of this can be found throughout the book literally there is no page without description. A description on a tree could even go on for 3 pages. Personally that was what lost my interest. An example I found was on page 169 where it says 'The twins watched anxiously and Piggy sat expressionless behind the luminous wall of his myopia.' This shoes both the scenery and Piggy's attitude which is stubborn. This shows his stubbornness because the author says he was sitting expressionless which is usually what I do when I'm frustrated. Another good description Golding had was on page 158 where it says 'The air was heavy with unspoken knowledge.' This is showing the tension between Piggy and the other people on the island who are not listening to him.I enjoyed how he used Piggy to get the theme across because of the way he left Piggy there just open. I can compare Piggy to an unlocked door that people just walk by they will never know what they have just missed. That is what happened to Piggy they didn't expect anything from him just because of his obesity and judged him just by that which is plain wrong. Just because it is wrong many people do it in present day it must just be a natural judgment. But really Piggy is a smart kid. In my opinion I believe that they would have gotten off the island if they just let Piggy be leader or at least do more work. In my opinion the theme was 'Use what you have don't make assumptions and you always have something.' That is the first thing they did when they saw Piggy make fun of him. They let that fly past their heads and assumed he wouldn't help. Really he was their key to success and knowledge. They always had him there but just left him hanging.So if you are thinking about buying this book or not I would say go ahead. Anyways the most you have to lose is a few dollars. Maybe if you don't like description then just don't even bother but if you adore description then defiantly try this book. You will finish it and realize that book really wasn't that bad after all.

" The author's purpose for writing this book is to send a message to the readers. I agree with his message because it informs you of how cruel people can be. I think the literary element the author handled best was the characters. They were very well described by their looks as well as their actions. This book was believable because the way the story was written because it has real personalities as real people. For example when people are in a group they change to fit in just like the characters in the story they all became savages. This book was 'less than perfect' because it didn't have any girls and the ending was not very elaborate either. I would fix the flaws by adding more things like girls to see how they would react and be more elaborate in the ending. If I were to rate this book it would be fair. ",3.0

" 'Lord of the Flies' is displayed as a remarkable novel. The plot shows suspense adventure and thrills. As the novel slowly uncovers itself each of the character's inside personality also slowly reveals. The novel shows the extent of action humans would take for survival and the wide and vague diverse personalities different people contain within.Once the reader picks up the book they would be enthralled in the novel and would feel trapped within. The words are used so intensely that the reader will often feel as if they are part of the story. This novel is beautifully written and the plot is presented in a unique manner.'Lord of the Flies' is a rather tragic and frightening novel. The protagonist goes through never-ending adventures for the hope of survival. The antagonist does whatever it takes to get rid of the protagonist and would go far beyond imagination. Even though the protagonist was a static character unfortunately the antagonist is thought to be a dynamic character that turns evil through a twist of fate. ",3.0
" Lord of the Flies is an imaginative novel that I recommend to all patient readers. I believe in this novel like others I have read published in this period has a slow paced plot that does not have incredible amounts of action. In this book it is sometimes necessary to read two chapters before something exciting accure. For this reason I feel the book may leave something to be desired among the new generation of readers. However I feel that William Golding does a great job of creating the beautiful yet traitorous terrain and characters on the island. Overall this book deserves its crown as one of the best books of its type in the 20th Century. ",3.0
" Lord of the flies is a book based on survival--the strong overcoming the weak. A bunch of boys crash into a deserted island and slowly become very primitive. When Jack separates the boys into two different tribes they transform from civil to barbaric. The two groups begin to turn on one another. Farther into the book the fighting increases and the tribes really start to break away from one another.The point of this book is that mankind thinks that their society is civilized but it is still very primitive. The world today is still based on survival; the strong overcome the weak. Even now one angry word and our society becomes barbaric. Sometimes wars start and friendships end just by saying the wrong words. As each day passes the boys start to destroy one another. Simple words between some of the boys end up agitating the tribes and battles ensue.The Toronto School Board banned this classic from all its schools citing that it was racist for use of the word 'niggers.' As I was looking at all the banned books I noticed how many are banned for their language. I understand some of this language is harsh but that is how society acts. These words help to express the anger the tribes are feeling. Without these words the reader will never fully understand the hatred between the tribes. ",3.0
" Lord of the Flies is a very deep and symbolic novel perhaps too much of one to really be entertaining. While i did enjoy the basic storyline Lord of the Flies was written in a way that i found extremely confusing and basically uninteresting. The parts of it that i acctually understood weren't so bad though.In the start of the novel a lot of young boys find themselves trapped on an island with no adults. In the first few days that they are there they elect a leader set up rules and get an organized camp going. They seem to be used to having rules and regualtions and no one objects to this. There are some important main characters in this book. Ralph is the civilized rational figure who is elected cheif in the beginning. He knows what needs to be done to get rescued and throuout the book he is focused on that. Then there is Jack who turns out to be the 'bad guy'. He wants to be the cheif and he really isn't interested in doing productive things he wants to hunt instead. Piggy is the wise figure in this novel. His ideas always are the obviously correct thing to do but because he is somewhat of a nerd no one really listens to him and most of what he says is shot down.Throuought this book civilization goes down the drain. Jack eventually breaks off from the rest of the group with his hunters and soon enough all the boys except for the little ones Piggy and Ralph join his tribe to feast dance and have fun.The conch the shell that symbolized organization and power in the start of the novel is smashed into thousands of pieces which shows us that the morals and society of the boys has completely died. The beast which all the boys are afraid of symbolizes the fear that we all have of the unknown. It seemed that every word in Lord of the Flies had some deep hidden meaning which i felt made the book tedious and confusing. Yes it is a good book but would i read it again? No. ",3.0

" This book is an important book of what happens in a society when there are no rules or any guide lines to follow. Ever since the boys were placed on the island they were destined to fail at creating their own perfect environment. The setting they are in starts out as a good fun environment to them but by all of the boys hunger for power it turns them against eachother and turns this so called 'good' island into a 'bad' island.Jack is a representation of evil by how he thirsts for blood and meat as a opposed to being rescued. He would let the fire go out which is their only chance for survival just to cut open a pig. Ralph represents good by trying to create order shelter and a way to be rescued. Jacks group takes over the island creating the human motivation for evil and hunting. Ralph being the only one left his motivation is forced into surviving as opposed to creating order. The whole island turns to chaos when just one person takes control. This person represents the devil figure and he takes down everyone on the whole island except for Ralph. This book shows how important rules and order are in a society today. It also shows how human motivation can completely take over the whole human body and let barbaric things happen that would not happen in a normal oderly society today. ",3.0
" Lord of the Flies is a very enjoyable book. It is a book that you would enjoy reading if you like analyzing day-to-day life in your litature. The way Golding makes the boys on the island symbolize people and actions in the real world is what makes the book so good. I origianly thought the book was gooing to be boring and hard to catch on to but after I got into the book I wanted to know more about the characters and what was going to happen next. If you dont like putting yourself into your reading then you would not like this book. The plot in this story is always changing because right when you thilnk something predictable is going to happen golding puts a spin on how they characters act or what their next action is going to be. Overall I thought Lord of the Flies is a good book. ",3.0

They choose Ralph as their leader and Ralph appoints Jack to be in charge of food.Ralph Jack and another boy Simon  set off on an expedition to explore the island. When they return Ralph says that they should light a signal fire to attract the attention of passing ships. The boys ignite some dead wood by reflecting sunlight through the lenses of Piggy's eyeglasses. The boys are playing rather than monitoring the fire and the fir engulf the forest. One of the youngest boys in the group disappears during the fire never returning presumably having burned to death.One day a ship passes and Ralph and Piggy notice that the signals fire which had been the hunters' responsibility to maintain has burned out. Furious Ralph accosts Jack but the hunter has just returned with his first kill. Piggy criticizes Jack who hits Piggy across the face. Ralph blows the conch shell and scolds the boys in a speech intended to restore order. At the meeting it quickly becomes clear that some of the boys have started to become afraid. The littlest boys known as the littluns have had nightmares from the beginning and more and more boys now believe that there is some sort of beast or monster on the island. The older boys try to convince the others at the meeting to think rationally asking where such a monster could possibly hide during the daytime. One of the littluns suggests that it hides in the sea. Not long after the meeting some military planes battle high above the island. The boys asleep below do not notice the flashing lights and explosions in the clouds. A parachutist drifts down on the mountain. Sam and Eric are responsible for watching the fire at night they are asleep and do not see the parachutist land. When the twins wake up they see the enormous shadow of his parachute and hear the strange flapping noises it makes. Thinking the island beast is at hand they rush back to the camp in terror. Jack and Ralph travel up the mountain.. The group holds a meeting at which Jack and Ralph tell the others of the sighting. Jack says that Ralph is a coward and that he should be removed from office but the other boys refuse to vote Ralph out of power. Jack angrily runs away down the beach calling all the hunters to join him. Ralph rallies the remaining boys to build a new signal fire this time on the beach rather than on the mountain. They obey but before they have finished most of them have slipped away to join Jack.Jack declares himself the leader of the new tribe of hunters and organizes a hunt of a pig a violent slaughter followed by sowing the head to a stick as a offering to the beast. Later encountering the bloody fly-covered head Simon has a terrible vision during which it seems to him that the head is speaking. The voice says that Simon will never escape him for he exists within all men. Simon faints. When he wakes up he goes to the mountain where he sees the dead parachutist. Understanding then that the beast does not exist. Simon travels to the beach to tell the others what he has seen. But the others are in the middle of a chaotic revelry when they see Simon's shadowy figure emerge from the jungle they fall upon him and kill him with their bare hands and teeth.Ralph hides for the rest of the night and the following day while the others hunt him like an animal.. Ralph collapses in exhaustion after being chased out of the forest but when he looks up he sees a British naval officer standing over him. The officer's ship noticed the fire raging in the jungle. The other boys reach the beach and stop in their tracks at the sight of the officer. Amazed at the spectacle of this group the officer asks Ralph to explain. Ralph is overwhelmed by the knowledge that he is safe but thinking about what has happened on the island he begins to weep. The other boys begin to sob as well.I enjoyed reading this book it was very interesting and had a lot of action in it. I liked how the ending began with the plane going down and the boys being stranded on the island. Another favorite part of the book was towards the end when all the boys break up and they are fighting. Overall this was a good book to read and I would recommend it to anyone. ",3.0

" Imagine you are trapped on an island with a group of boys. What do you do? How do you survive?William Golding's novel 'Lord of the Flies' was written in 1954. It is an action/adventure book about a group who suffer a horrific plane crash and the boys are stranded on an island during the World War II era. The tale involves the struggle of power between two boys. Ralph is just your average male just looking for law and order. Jack on the other hand is a constant slave to power.Just imagine what boys would do when stranded by themselves. One thing they do is paint their faces and turn into savages. The book brings you on a journey of boys trying to survive or will they just be boys and play forgetting about the fight for survival?Golding shows us that everything has a good and evil side. The book does have its twists and turns and some things will surprise you. Despite all of the entertainment I felt this book was very predictable. What else could you get in a story about people stranded on an island? This does not necessarily mean it is not a good book though. I guess you can only judge it by reading it for your self. ",3.0
" With no parents teachers or rules is there really any question as to why the characters in Lord of the Flies by William Golding had no mercy? The story is about a group of English boys on their way to boarding school when their plane gets shot down in the middle of World War II and end up stranded on an island. They try to form a society and govern themselves but not long after the boys are having chaos for breakfast and anarchy for lunch. The book reminds me of the movie Thirteen only the male version. In Thirteen the main character goes to shocking lengths to befriend the most popular girl in school. Before her mother knows it she is powerless to rescue her daughter from a whirlwind of drugs sex and crime). They both I find are not shocking at all. This is the way people today are to say you were shocked is saying your living your life blind. Ralph is your typical guy in high school who is unsure of himself and just watches the bully pick on the little kid. Jack on the other hand is the jock/bully who everyone 'admires' whether it is in fear or respect. Simon is the artsy type. He is out of the box and in his won world. Piggy a very intelligent boy would be your 'nerd' who stands up for what he believes in. The Lord of the Flies is a well written book full of truth. When you read the story don't be disgusted. Ask yourself 'what would I do if I were twelve years old and stranded on an island?' ",3.0
" I read Lord of the Flies knowing it's a classic and for the most part I thought it was pretty good. It details the story of young boys stranded on an island after a plane crash. At first the primary character of the novel Ralph heads the dictatorship that begins but as time passes Ralph comes to blow with Jack. Where Ralph sees the boys' primary concern being signaling a passing ship for help Jack is concerned with hunting. So two groups emerge with Ralph and Jack as the leaders. After that some very dramatic and interesting happenings take place as the reader sees savagery and visciousness develop amongst the boys.The only real problem I had with the story was the lack of explanation about the boys. The novel starts after the plane crash has taken place and the author never offers an explanation for who these boys are or where they were going. Also I found it somewhat unrealistic the way in which the boys seemed to get along so well on their own. They didn't seem nearly as frightened as I'd imagine boys would be in their place in reality.Overall I say this book is worth reading if you're interested. It's not too long and has a pretty good story. ",3.0
" Now before I start let me just say that this book is not a bad book just an overrated oneThis is an O.K although it bored me when i read it in High School I wondered why we just couldn't have read 'Return of the Native' or something better I don't know why it is on required reading lists nor why it was made into two movies. I guess when you pick apart every syllable and say it means something profound then it does. As for a plot that means anything or charecters that make the slightest bit of sense well lets just forget that.At best you have a harrowing tale about kids being trapped on an island losing their identify here the become a mycocausum for different types of society.

" I read this book in high school and didn't like it at first because it was a little tough for me and the attempts to get off the island seemed to drag on to the point where I no longer cared if they got off the island at all but then I read it again and seemed to like it. It was a favorite for most of the students in my class so I decided to give the novel another try and I'm glad I did...I read this book a second time very quickly as I was intrigued by everything that went on in LOTF and I learned a valuable lesson in that if you don't come together in a time of need you will suffer and also that we sometimes fear what will happen and fear to help others so we are classified as 'beasts' I found something valuable the second time I read this novel rather than the first go around...Do read this book..I think you will enjoy it and get a lot from it.

" In my opinion Golding's reasons for writing this book are to show that there is an inner beast in everyone. I agree with his message because there is a point in everyone's day or life that their true beast comes out. The best literary elements that Golding uses were foreshadowing and symbolism. He uses symbolism the best in the way he used Piggy's glasses to reveal a sign of vision. Not just eye-sight but the sight of seeing things clearly. Piggy was the only one on the island that had a clear vision of life and he was also able to see that rules are needed in life for things to work out and for there not to be any serious conflicts. L.O.F. is a very realistic book because if any number of people were stranded on an island without any rules there would be absolute chaos. People would be power hungry like Jack. There would be a few people that thought that rules were neccessary to survive like Piggy.They would eventually turn into worrying about themselves and getting only what they need to survive in life. I think the book could have had a better ending. A reader from LBHS (Long Branch High School)! ",3.0
" Golding's purpose for writing Lord Of The Flies was to show mankind at its worst and how human nature can go wrong. Golding's message was that there is evil inside of us all. Golding is correct in this manner but I thing that everyone has good in them too. In Golding's Lord of the Flies he handled the characters the best. The characters were all well developed and each one represented a different aspect of human nature",3.0
" I think that the author's purpose for writing this book was to tell how to survive in the world/forest without adult supervision. I agree because the boys would have needed to learn how to survive without supervision sooner or later in their lifetime. In this book I think that the author used climax best because it got extremely intense as it got closer to the end of the book. I liked the intenseness in the book a lot. This book was believable to me. It was believable because the events that took place really could have happened. The only thing that could not have taken place was that an airplane was attacked than crashed and no adults survived any of it. I also think that the book was less than perfect. It was good writing and good reading. I rate this book fair. ",3.0
" Listening to this novel doesn't improve it. You get the added bonus track of Golding groaning on and on and on about how he got the inspiration for this overly simplistic morality tale.

" The book Lord of the Flies is a story about a group of kids getting stranded on a deserted island and how they survive without adults. I didn't like the way that many of the kids went crazy. I know you are stranded on a deserted island but i don't believe that you would just go crazy like that. I know that being on an island like that would probably make you alittle crazy but not enough to brutally kill two of your peers. They all knew that in order to be survive they needed to maintain order. I don't believe they would just betray their elected leader just to have some fun. As for the characters I like Ralph. He handled himself well in the situtation. I did his best to maintain as much order as he could. You could tell that Ralph was had the potential for a good leader. Jack on the other hand I did't like. At first he seemed like he was a nice kid but then he turned on Ralph and formed his own tribe. I couldn't believe when kids actually followed him. Then he got everyone to turn on Ralph who was just trying to keep order on the island. At one point Ralph gives in to Jack and goes to have a feast with him. They then kill Simon because they thought it was the monster running down the beach. Jack just made things out of control with his new tribe. He turned everyone into killers. I like Piggy for one reason because he was the only one to stay with Ralph. This eventually got him killed but he was loyal to the leader that he elected. Beside that he was that great of a character. He seemed like he would get on your nerves after awhile. Thats mainly the reason I didn't like his character that much. The ending of the book was horrible. I was expecting something more to happen than for them to just get rescued. That is the main reason i didn't like this book ",3.0

" Briefly for those of you that don't know Lord of the Flies is a book about a group of boys who are stranded on an island. At first they get along but as the book progresses they fight and kill each other.Well this was a book I had to read for school. I felt that chapters 1-7 were boring 8-10 were okay and 11 and 12 were boring. It had some exciting moments but it had many times more boring moments. There was really no one to root for no good guy you cared to see to live until the end. In other words I couldn't have cared less if they all died. There is a whole lot of symbolism. Actually I am going to have to cut this review short 'caue I have to work on notes about the allusions in it. Its due tommorow ( uh-oh ).Anyway if you are the type of person who enjoys sitting around reading boring books this book is for you!Oh- oops. I just read the rules. This nice little review couldn't ever qualify for a prize. I guess I should explain where Golding went wrong. Well I thought that at points it kind of rambled on. As I said before there wasn't anyone that you really could root for. I think that if Golding had created some sort of wonderful character that was nice to everyone heroic smart not afraid then you would want to turn the pages to see if they would leave. Well now I really got to go and work on those notes! ",3.0
" Imagine you are trapped on an island with a group of boys. What do you do? How do you survive?William Golding's novel 'Lord of the Flies' was written in 1954. It is an action/adventure book about a group who suffer a horrific plane crash and the boys are stranded on an island. It takes place during the World War II era. The tale involves the struggle of power between two boys. One who's name is Ralph is just your average male just looking for law and order. Jack on the other hand is a constant slave to power.Just imagine what boys would do when stranded by themselves. One thing they do is paint their faces savagely kill pigs through their anuses and turn into savages. The book brings you on a journey of boys trying to survive or will they just be boys and play forgetting about the fight for survival.This book is very symbolic in meaning that everything has a good and evil side. The book does have its twists and turns and some things will surprise you. Despite all of the entertainment I felt this book was very predictable. What else could you get in a story about people stranded on an island? This does not necessarily mean it is not a good book though. I guess you can only judge it by reading it for your self. ",3.0
" Willam Goldings novel The Lord Of The Flies is a a intresting deep novel. It touches on alot of levels about society and how we act as people. The novel is about a group of young boys from Britain who are on a plane on their way to boarding school when it gets shot down and crashes on a island. There are four main characters Ralph who is the leader Piggy who is the smart one Jack the strong agressive one And Simon the naturalist relgious one. Through these boys you see the diffrent facets of society and how they are suppose to interact. During the time they spend on the island the rules of a civilized society start to fade away and brings out the primal instaincts in our human nature due to survial of the fittest.. I belive that this is a great novel to read and it displays the ideas of what would happen if societys rules were taken away and how we would function. Using children in stead of adults is also a great idea for it shows that even innocents can turn into savage beasts. ",3.0
" William Goldings Lord of the Flies is a thrill-seeking book. When reading Lord of the flies you will sit at the edge of your chair with the boys that try to fight for survival as their insanity takes over them. Roger Ralph Piggy Jack and Simon the boarding school boys who have just crash-landed on this island; with no parental guidance no rules and now have to learn how to get along with each other in order to get off. As Ralph and Jack battle it out for who will be leader one wants things to be in control and the other thrives to be in control of the others that are stranded too. Just as one-boy stumbles upon a beast we wonder just what could happen next. This is surely a remarkable book for boys to read if they are adventurous them selves. Over SEVEN MILLION copies were sold this book was such a realistic book I could see why. As you read this book you won't put it down because when the unknown of others on an island has you stranded together you must work your hardest to survive you will learn who will and who won't...... would you survive reading this book?

" Okay so this book is recommended. Exciting but boring at times. The beginning was very boring and it stayed that way until pretty far into the book. The excitement level went up and down after the beginning. (The end was very exciting.) (Spoiler alert!) The book ended very suddenly. That was a flaw that really bothered me. (End of spoiler!) This book was very intense towards the end. The kids are a little bit dumb. Except for a few of them.(No offense.) But it had great impact on the excitement so I can not call that a flaw. (Even though I was about to a second ago.) This book is pretty good. Check it out! ",3.0

" Lord of the Flies by William Golding was a great book that took some time to develop. I at first thought that this book would not keep my attention. As I read on I became more and more interested in this book. The idea of having a group of children varying in age stranded on an island was very fascinating. I didn't know how they would react to this situation they were placed in and that's part of the reason this book kept my interest.At first the kids thought it was fun not having any adult supervision. The boys agree to work together with Ralph trying to maintain order by assigning various chores such as keeping a signal fire going that they started with piggy's glasses and gathering food. However the chores stop being done and their society breaks down. This reaches its peak when Ralph sees a ship in the distance and the signal fire is out. The hunting boys were supposed to keep it going and before Ralph can scold them they come back with a kill. This turns the kid's loyalty toward Jack. I thought this was the most interesting part of this book. I enjoyed how it showed the struggle in society between order and lack of it. As jack gains power among the boys Ralph finds himself suddenly being hunted by his former friends. These kids turned savages show no remorse when they kill one of their own with there bare hands and teeth. I found it very compelling how these civilized kids can suddenly deliberately want to kill one of there former friends. However the reason I gave this book a three out of five was the ending. There was great action throughout the book and then it suddenly ends just by Ralph running out of the jungle to see a British Naval Officer.This books characters exemplify three distinct aspects of human nature. Jack shows mans roots in his primitive behavior. He opts to hunt and be free shirking the duties that could ultimately rescue him. Ralph's character shows the desire of man to be civilized yet be free and wild as well. He wants to be rescued but at other times is intrigued by the hunt and wild side of human nature. He shows his desire to be rescued by trying to keep order and have chores. Oppositely he is overwhelmed by the hunt and ultimately kills his friend in the fatal attack on the beach. Finally Piggy is on the opposite spectrum from Jack. He is constantly reminding the others of the proper way to act and mentions adult's behavior as an example. These characters represent the constant struggles that live inside mankind in everyday life.In conclusion this was a great book to read. The plot was exciting with the exception of the mundane ending. It is a book that can be read on many levels and with characters that represent struggles that continuously plague the human mind. I gave this book a three out of five and would recommend others to check it out. ",3.0
" The main thing that people rave about this book is its SYMBOLISM. Well I think that symbolism is based on your own opinion. We don't know that the author meant to have this particular thing represent this particular idea. When you get to the story itself the first four chapters and the last four chapters are worth a read. However everything in between I found to be very boring and you find yourself having to stop and re-read certain things because you forget what is happening; there is no action to help keep you up to speed.Just FYI I didn't have to read this book for school. I read it in my spare time. From what I understand those who must read it for school have a far lower opinion of this novel but I don't know that for a fact. ",3.0
" The Lord of the Flies begins in complete chaos. A group of young boys are stranded on a tropical island after their military school plane was shot down. All the adults onboard were killed so the boys were completely alone. Even without the supervision and direction of parents to help them the boys try to get organized. The pick a leader establish a set of 'laws' for the island and make plans for their survival.Throughout the book there is one boy who is rediculed at every chance and only one boy tries to defend him. There is a constant battle for power between the boys named Ralph who is sensible and only concerned with getting rescued and the boy called Jack who is a savage and only thinks of hunting pigs and having fun. After heated arguments that split the boys in two raids by the hunters that destroy Ralph's shelter and his only chance of making fire and the murder of two boys by Jack's tribe the battle escalates to a the whole island going up in flames while the hunters try to flush out their prey... Ralph.Golding uses a lot of desciption to make you feel as though this could actually happen. He creates a realistic microcosm (a little 'world' that represents a bigger world) with a government and a trouble-maker that shows what humans resort to in times of desperation. The climax of the book is a good surprise but it ends too quickly without enough explaination to understand it easily. I enjoyed the story but Golding repeats things too much and I didn't even like those parts when I read them the first time. Jack talks about hunting too much Ralph talks about keeping the fire going too much and I hate the song the hunters sing. It repeats killing the beast and spilling its blood over and over and they sing it all the time. Without these annoying repeats and the short boring periods spred throughout the book I would say that the Lord of the Flies is a great story (but it is not written like one.) ",3.0
" Getting right into the story William Golding has a good plot in the book 'Lord Of The Flies' but some how knew to how to make me unpatient. The story starts on an island where a plane crash of young British boys had occured. The sorty takes the reader through the horrors of how these boys had to work together to survive and what struggles they went through with each other. William Golding did a good job of showing how much different people are and what different goals people have. 'Loard Of The Flies' was a quick read for me yet it still made me impatient because the charactures kept repeating themselves. Ralf a leader in the book would always say 'we need to keep the fire going.' Jack another leader would always say 'we need to hunt.' Sure the book needed to state this so we could get to know the characters but we didn't need to read these quotes every five minutes This book was very similar to 'Animal Farm' except it used people instead of animals. I saw lots of similarites in the two books and how power can get into the wrong hands. Some people like to abuse their powers and these two books show that really well. I think people who like to read about government would like this book because it relates to how a country is ran. Willam Golding did a good job of using description in which he described every little detail whether it was a person the island or what the boys were doing. 'The Bushes crashed ahead of them. Boys flung themsleves wildly from the pig track and scrabbled in the creepersscreaming.' This is just one of the many quotes where William Golding uses vivid details. I have been trying to add more details to my stories ",3.0

" After more than half a century William Golding's first novel still has the power to chill the blood with its cautionary tale of the degeneration of a group of castaway schoolboys into the depths of animal savagery. However as a criticism of more optimistic boys' adventure stories as a critique of democracy or as anything much beyond a warning of the obvious that young children especially young boys must be carefully civilized (and continually re-civilized) it's a failure... because Mr. Golding cheats. Though Mr. Golding would no doubt claim (with justification) that boy's adventure authors tended to stack the deck in favor of their protagonists Mr. Golding does the opposite. His characters never had a chance. A comparison specifically with R. M. Ballantyne'sThe Coral Island referred to in the novel and generally with other boys' own adventures should suffice to prove the point.AGE",3.0
" This book is more of an insight into Mr. Golding's view of humanity than it is an insight into humanity itself. Needless to say Mr. Golding has a very negative view of people. Perhaps his view is colored by the fact that he lived through the development and dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan (atomic bombs are brought up in the book as having hit the airport from where the boy's plane departed) and the rise of Nazism in Germany. Mr. Golding uses a group of plane wreaked boys to tell his tale of what he thinks is the natural denigration of society. Still I can't find his view at all consistent with the world around us. If savagery was natural for people we would not have developed into a civilized society. In fact with few exceptions all peoples form structured societies that impart rules for the welfare of the group; not the other way around as Mr. Golding would have us believe. Except for few notable exceptions (like Nazi Germany) savagery is not natural for people. Even there civilized peoples prevailed. Additionally I believe this book has racist overtones in that Mr. Golding chooses to use the jungle motif to display his version of savagery. Why couldn't he use another back drop?Technically good writing gets the book three stars. ",3.0

" The 'Lord of the Flies' is an incredible journey that follows a group of boys stranded on an island after a plane crash. All the parents on the plane have died so this big group of boys has to fend for themselves. A big part of this story is about how the boys still create rules to govern the island. A leader comes around named Ralph who has continuous argumments with Jack the oldest who himelf wants to be in charge.Things start off well but sitings of a beast on the island scare many. One of the boys named Piggy a very intelligent but not liked boy has great ideas and tries to get everyone to listen to Ralph and do what he says. One thing Ralph is big on is keeping a rescue fire going. Jack makes a group of hunters to get meat and when their out hunting the fire goes out as a plane flew by but couldn't tell anyone was there because there was no smoke.Ralph and Jack get into a huge argument that ends up seperating the boys into a group of rebelious hunters lead by Jack and the other group with Piggy and Jack. Jack's group has all but Piggy and jack. Gruesome and odd ending chapters see the end of some as the hunters kill them. The leadership and rules set on this island fall apart and shows how rules can diminish is a second and things can turn ugly fast. This book was a very good one to read it had a an ending that leaves you thinking and a story that makes you think about your own life and a great story about these boys on an island who have to fend for themselves create rules and watch things diminish and change drastically after disagreements and a fight for power take place on this island. I reccomend this book to anyone who is looking fo a fun and interesting story to read that has a great ending that leaves you thinking about what's next. ",3.0
" Personally I didn't completely like Lord of the Flies but I still give it thumbs up for the outstanding plot. It began rather slow and dull and continued that way until about three- quarters of the way. I believed too much symbolism and much unnecessary high levels of vocabulary were used throughout Lord of the Flies. Considering this book is required to be read in the English classes of most high school students I believed it should have connected to us in a more straightforward manner as in contrast to a symbolic way as it did. Furthermore when I begin to read a novel I am usually brought in or attracted by the beginning of the book so I can keep interest in it. If I had not been required to read Lord of the Flies I would have almost certainly stopped to read it due to the lack of enticement and hooks in the novel.Towards the end of Lord of the Flies is where the book began to get interesting and truly began to hook me into reading more and even reading ahead of the class. Even though it gets good in the end if you look at it from another point of view things begin to get a bit out of perspective and maybe out of reality. That's when you must realize that these kids have been stranded on an island for an incredible amount of time and things can sometimes get out of control; you'll have to read the book to find out exactly what happens. Even though I didn't personally like Lord of the Flies I still believe every sophomore should be required to read it due to the great storyline and I also believe it is different from most novels but in a good way.

" Upon his return from World War II William Golding wrote the book Lord of the Flies demonstrating how the war had altered his view of humanity and the evil it was capable of. Borrowed extensively from R. M. Ballantyne's The Coral Island Lord of the Flies is set on an island that acts a microcosm of WWII. The school boys demonstrate what Golding believes will happen should man be unleashed into the wild with no society to monitor his actions what will happen when man gets in touch with the primitive evil inside him. Using supposedly innocent children to enact this tragedy Golding makes his message even more daunting and thought-evoking.In the midst of war a plane evacuating a group of school boys from Britain is shot down over a deserted island far off course. The story follows the boys' attempts to survive and to be rescued. It follows their process of electing a leader the battle between Ralph and Jack and the island's descent into chaos. This novel is pretty intense. The allegorical struggle between good and evil is suggested in the title of the novel. The title is said to be a reference to the Hebrew name Beelzebub (literally 'Lord of Flies') a name sometimes used as a synonym for Satan.The story which seems to be another survival story keeps its readers engaged with the tension contained in the calm yet eerie narration. The mystery laced yet seemingly uneventful opening of the novel immediately captures the attention of readers and holds them in a sort of frustrating suspense as they wonder about the meaning and significance behind the introduction. As the story develops and the island is enveloped in madness the reader wonders in horror at the savagery such young and supposedly innocent children are capable of. Without any sense of morality and other societal influences children are the perfect subjects in this examination of true human nature.The syntactical structure and the abundant imagery truly make Lord of the Flies a graphic and daunting read. Variations in syntax between long continuous lines and choppy rhythmic sentences help readers visualize and relate to the situation in the book. Be it the pounding nervousness as their camp is invaded by children gone wild or the frightening image of the 'lord of the flies' each scene is intensified by the author's mastery of language. It helps a reader further delve into Golding's microcosm of humanity as the boys' descent into savagery threatens our faith in the good of humanity.Despite the magnificence of its message and the remarkable skill with which this novel is crafted I definitely do not count Lord of the Flies as amongst one of my favorite books. I personally felt that Golding was far too pessimistic in his view of humanity. While the story does serve was a frightful caution sign it does not reflect the whole of humanity. Golding seems to have been greatly affected by his experience in WWII. It is true that war brings out the worst in people but it is also true that war and savagery do not define our existence. Perhaps I am simply far too optimistic but I feel that just as there is innate evil in the world so is there innate good. That is why the struggle between good and evil is a ever present theme in both literature and life.Lord of the Flies is a great read if its allegorical message is taken with caution. Its deeply developed characters add complexity to this mind shaking story. The suspenseful plot in addition to Golding's eerie narration makes Lord of the Flies a novel that will leave you shivering. All in all it is worth the read. That is unless you'd rather go for something less philosophical and more simplistic. ",3.0
" Although the story of the book was decent and the symbolism very complex I did not really agree with the message of the book and found its theme unrealistic. I don't think that the situation would collapse into anarchy but instead primitive government such as in the beginning of the book.The desires of the boys to 'just have fun' were very unrealistic and counter-intuitive. For example not one person outside of Ralph and Piggy truly care about getting off the island. No one misses their family and it is not even mentioned. There is no discussion of the boys' background except for the fact that they are English and nobody ever thinks about it. It is completely unrealistic to ignore the fact that in the real world the first priority of the boys would be to try and escape and go back to the civilized world.Secondly the overwhelming desire for meat which is supposed to symbolize the savagery in humans is highly exaggerated. The fruit on the island is plentiful and there are many resources. The boys never have any problem getting food and realistically would not engage in such frivolous hunting for meat.I also found the characterization extremely flat. The characters are just faceless names on the page outside of Raplh Piggy Jack and Simon. ",3.0
" First off I really want to state how dissapointed I am that I did not enjoy Lord of The Flies more. The concept is one of the best in the history of literature",3.0
" In this microcosmic society created by the mind of Golding things got too ridiculous too quick. First all the boys crash on this deserted island after being shot down by a bomber. Within a few days they burnt down half the island killing a boy and broke up into groups with a killing machine and a democratic leader. Needless to say they start by killing the weakest and last killing the smartest. The only problem with this is that they are only twelve year old boys who at the very least could have a civil war within a matter of days.I think Golding had a great point of what a society would do to itself and he showed the power children had which was in fact just a minor display in comparison to the great civil wars within our own countries. The only deal with this is that it wasn't very believable. Aside from that he perfectly displayed his point. He portrayed every character as a crucial member of society. You have Ralph who's the democratic leader believing in order Jack who was the dictator or person that believed in his own way Piggy the smart one who had all the right ideas and Simon who was the more spiritual one who rather would do his own thing and believed in helping others and looking out for the smaller weaker children. You could see this in each person and connect in some way because Golding always displayed them doing the very things you saw them out for. At any rate I would at least say read it. ",3.0
" The book 'Lord of the flies' starts out with a group of Brittish boys that are stranded on an uninhabited island. Things start out great and the boys assign eachother jobs and responcibilities. The leader of the tribe is a boy named Ralph. But soon the boys become to interested in hunting and Jack (another boy in the tribe) decides to start his own tribe. Ralph is ok with this move because he thinks that Jack will come back to the group soon. But Jack doesn't ever come back to the group and ends up killing Simon (a member of Ralph's group). Jack's tribe is becoming violent and very savage- like. When Ralph confronts Jack's group about restoring peace and finding ways to get off the island another member of Ralph's group gets killed (a boy named Piggy). Now Jack's group wants to get Ralph out of the picture and try to kill him but right before they are going to do him in a Navel officer comes onto the island and stops the madness.I belive that the theme of this novel is evilness in chidren. This is the main because it is stated throughout the entire story. Golding shows and belives that children are born with evil and society makes us nice and polite. Golding also symbolizes this concept in many ways. One of these major symbols is Jack. Jack is relitively nice at first but as the story progressives and more chaos and fear is developed he becomes more agressive and evil. Another symbol is Piggy. Piggy was the symbol of intellagence and knowledge. When he was killed it was Golding's way of saying that without rules and guildlines evil will always conquere good. After reading the book I could say that I realy enjoyed the book and it got me thinking about what life is realy about. ",3.0
" I find it difficult to fully express my opinions about this book which I finished last night. On the one hand it was extremely exciting and fast paced in its general plot and description and this made it fun to read. On the other hand it was full of dark ominous foreboding and at times downright terrifying symbolism. I am normally not a big fan of excessive symbolism and this book had more than I had ever encountered. This alone would not make me dislike a book though. I found myself genuinely loathing the savages and this while it drew me into the book also made me hate reading it. I coulnd't shake the feeling that something terrible was going to happen and when it did the feeling didn't go away. All things considered I certainly feel that this book is superbly written and does a wonderful job of conveying its message. However I coulnd't stand the fact that the message was basically that humans are inherently evil. I couldn't disagree more and while I may be labeled a deluded optimist I can't bring myself to believe that some schoolboys on a desert island would end up killing each other. I found the thought most disturbing and depressing and that was my overall impression of the book.All in all this was a wonderfully done book with a clearly conveyed message and I am glad that I read it. However I disagreed with the message and found the book to be quite disturbing. My review couln't be much more mixed up could it? I would suggest that you read this book but be prepared to be shocked and detested. ",3.0
" I read some of this book in high school but read it in its entirety recently to see how I felt about it as a 32-year-old adult. I enjoyed it somewhat.It is a good plot concept in general with lots of opportunity for analysis and psychological scrutiny. However oftentimes I had a difficult time believing that the characters were children because they seemed to behave a little too adult for their age. The writing was a bit verbose for my tastes although not excessively so. Because of this it didn't suck me into it's world entirely and it wasn't something that I was very enthusiastic about finishing except to find out how it ends.Overall this is worth reading if you have any curiosity about it but it may take some determination to get through it.

" This book falls into the category of books that claim that a few mental exercises can make Einsteins out of all of us that the Einsteins and Newtons of the world are not that much different than the rest of us. While I don't agree with this belief I do believe that mental ability can be improved through exercises and I found many of the exercises to be interesting and helpful. I had a problem with the author's demonstration of how these exercises can help the reader. In the introduction the author has the reader read a section of text and then she introduces a 'Brain Power Doubler' for the reader to use while reading a second section of text. The 'Brain Power Doubler' is supposed to allow the reader to read the second section of text in less time than the first section of text even though the two sections are supposed to have the same number of words. When I went back and checked the number of words in both sections I found several times as many words in the first section than in the second section which had more to do with the time differences than the exercise.

" This is a review of the STERLING/PEARSON DVD 'Bob Hope Film Collection' edition (with the green cover!) I hope that helps set this apart from the other editions and reviews...The film is a good example of the Road movies - it's no Utopia or Morocco but it's still very entertaining. Lamour is ravishing whilst Hope and Crosby wise-crack and soft-shoe with the best of 'em. All in all a four star movie.However this DVD has a rather pathetic amount of extras (ie. none) a fair-to-middling print and a very low audio track. My suggestion is to find another DVD edition. At the end of the day - we all want to upgrade from VHS to DVD so why settle for an edition that is estentially lower quality? ",3.0
" I have not used Dip It and I'm sure it works great but I used regular powdered dishwasher soap and it worked amazingly well. I have a Farberware 12-cup stainless steel percolator that the inside was all stained after 10 years of use. Could not get the stains out no matter how hard I scrubbed. And the stem basket basket lid and top lid were badly stained as well.I ran it through 2 perk cycles using 2 tablespoons (each time) of dishwash in the basket. The first time I filled it up to the 12 cup line with water and ran it with all the parts in place (stem basket basket lid top lid). When it was done the water was literally black from the stains it had removed and all the parts were spotless and the inside of the urn was spotless up to the 12 cup water line. The few inches above that were still slightly stained so I ran it a second time with the 2 tablespoons of dishwash this time filling the pot up completely with water to the very top of the urn with all the parts installed.

You see this '80s remake of the 1950-something [ahem] 'classic' is really just a ridiculous b-movie with fancy special effects.The plot is almost as absurd as the title following what appears to be a colossal alien jelly as it rampages through an American town munching on its inhabitants and generally being a bit of a nuisance. Cue face melting blood spurting and lots and lots of gore.The acting is as cheesy as everything else in the movie and the very idea of a psychotic blob murdering people is somewhat laughable but as i already mentioned this is an entertaining Saturday night horror film.

" Once upon a time in 1958 a little horror gem was made it was titled 'The Blob' now the this blob wasn't like any other blob oh no sir this blob was mean and liked to eat people with its nasty gelatin..Ok enough cute talk let's get to the movie.This remake of the original 50's classic makes the best effort to re-invent the story of a meteorite that carries a deadly alien life form...or so it seems. This time around we have Shawnee Smith as the lead protagonist (best known from Saw franchise) her role in this film is as great as it is in the saw movies she presents a typical teenager but with a little bit of attitude. Along are other forgotten 80's stars.I have to admit that the plot may be in certain ways similar to that of the original but the Chuck Russell (Director) brings new gimmicks and frights to what you may think can be your typical cheesy horror flick. I myself was surprised by some of the moments were I jumped in the movie. The effects are also impressive even though by today's standards they are outdated there are still are alot of impressive mechanical effects that are not seen much nowadays.Personally this is a rare remake that's superior to the original. It's almost up to par with David Cronenberg's The Fly. I personally would buy it its slick funny and of course slimy lol.MY PERSONAL RATING",3.0
" Not a big fan of 50's sci-fi but the original Blob freaked me out something good. This one just doesn't retain the freakishness or eerie dread of the original.

Christopher Lambert rides around on a horse and struts around in armor while some unknown terror stalks around the basement of a castle. The castle is surrounded by more men with armor and horses who don't want anyone to enter or leave it although they're only moderately successful.

" If you are a rabid fan of ye olde epic Beowulf and are dying to see it adapted to film then this is probably not for you. I recommend The 13th Warrior instead. Actually I recommend The 13th Warrior to any fan of medieval action or fantasy adventure. My endorsement of Beowulf doesn't go NEARLY as far and yet somehow in spite of its many glaring flaws I find this 'adaptation' quite entertaining.This straight-to-video year 2000 take on the ancient tale stars Christopher Lambert as the superhuman hero Beowulf except this isn't the Dark Ages. Instead the events take place in a post-apocalyptic future of gears and steaming pipes (a setting that I feel was a mistake). It has Hrothgar the 'Border Lord' Grendel and Grendel's mother but everything else from the poem is absent and here the similarities begin to wane. As movies go this is Fortress meets Mortal Kombat (both of which starred Lambert) meets Mad Max and thrown somewhere in the middle of this techno-gothic realm is Beowulf. Beowulf himself has become a high-flying martial artist (thanks to Lambert's stand-in naturally); Grendel's mother has become a sexy porn star succubus who seduces Hrothgar in his dreams; and Grendel is your typical B-movie creature with some purple haze surrounding him at all times to make the costume seem more imposing (and point of fact it does make the man in a monster suit beastie seem less like what it actually is).Not unlike the old fantasy flick The Sword and the Sorcerer Beowulf still manages to be fun in spite of its many failings and sometimes laughable production values (not to mention laughable acting). I still haven't managed to grasp how it can equal more than the sum of its parts but if you don't expect a film version of the old epic and instead expect a second-rate Lambert action flick you might have fun also.

" I have read most of shakespeare's works but this one I haven't yet. For this movie that can only be a pre. Anyone who even considers any link with the original writing will be appalled by this movie. But anyone with the intelligence to read Shakespeare would be able to see in advance that this one movie has indeed nothing to do with the literature and also would be able to open their mind enough.And if you do that there is a chance (especially if you are a not too stupid man with still too much testosterone in his blood) you may like it. The vision behind it is a erotic melting pot of weird gothic romance unintentionally funny acrobatic fighting diverse (funny) acting archievements and a lot more. Basicly I think it was the director's wet dream version of Beowulf and as that it is abolutely fantastic.The modern technology in a basicly gothic setting has its appeal definately. The bodybag is totally rediculous and so is the speaker. But the costumes are often very cool. Sell all your clicheed fake immitation Matrix outfits this is the way to go. I am still looking for the top of the princess to give to my girlfriend. But seriously the costumes were one of the few things worth watching.For the monsters the CGI department used some tricky ways to make what basicly looks bad have enough appeal although I agree that the monsters are probably the least scary element of the movie. The mother in the end looked very awkward expecting something like in Species this new body of the mother looks very unpractical to me but in some way sexy as is the most important element of this movie. The editing of the shots of here is terrible beyond believe but there was probably not very much to begin with anyway it is easy to see the whole new look of the mother was only done in CGI and for the real action they only used images of the face with some make up and a few props truly B-movie style...As an actor Christopher Lambert is theoreticly a good choice to portray the character in the story. However in reality his performance is not toitally the way we would expect. Moments of more than wooden acting intervened by moments where it looks like he couldn't manage to keep a straight face and stop having fun about where the hell he ended up as an actor are all over the movie.The sexual fantasies about a Shakespeare play cannot be complete with a a certain amount of sexy women. The Princess as I mentioned gets all of the attention by her already mentioned outfit but if you as a man find time to watch her face you may find moments of acting beyond what to expect from this movie. The monster's mother goes even way further actually she is almost a parody of herself here.So what we see here is a movie made with a vision no mather what kind of vision or whose vision a universe is created. Attempts to do something like that always receive recognition. I wish I could get a chance to turn one of men's literary masterpieces in an almost mindless [...] of style and vision with a slightly erotic flavour it must have been great fun for the crew to work on this.As a viewer you first should really consider what this is and hopefully this review helps on that. This kind of movie indeed deserves a few loyal followers (probably the people who also love Starship Troopers) and masses of people left hating. I myself will definately see this movie again some time not that I love it. But it is inspriational in an artistic way and just entertaining to watch. ",3.0

" A very different style to this version. If you ever saw Fellini movies you might compare them to something he did to the Roman stories. I kind of liked it and although cheesy as Robert Law indicated it's worth a rental or maybe even a purchase if you like different approaches to classic stories. Christopher Lambert looks pretty good still and he has one heck of a stuntman doing somersaults and other tricks to beef up the sword fight scenes. They all have some unusual weapons to add to the hundred plus bloody ways to kill someone in this movie. Did I mention the method used to take people's heads off looks like a giant straight razor? Yeah and the castle looks like a fire belching refinery on steroids or is it Ozzy Osborne's home on amphetamines? Is there a difference you ask? Anyway it's a hoot if are willing to be open minded because the costumes look like something they bought at a Cyndi Lauper garage sale.

Christopher Lambert has a tendency to pick offbeat roles (such as The Sicillian) but they are quite charming nonetheless.

This is obviously shown up on budget and special effects by the 2007 film of the same name yet for some reason I still like this one. It has a kind of campy gothic theme think David Lynch's Dune version. Go in with low expectations and you might enjoy it. ",3.0

There were some really great sounds coming from the band and I had hoped that they would continue on this album. What we hear from Sean on 'STEREOTYPE A' sounds like a b-side from his album...ok so we see his influence on their sound. Fine. But where is Cibo's influence on CIBO MATTO? It is definately a 'Sean' song...good but it just doesn't fit. It just adds to this mismash of production. The good news? They've maintained the kooky lyrics and instrumental variety.

Lint Of Love - 3/5This song is kind of R&B-like.; The lyrics seem to mean something but I can't tell what. This one doesn't really hold up.5.) Moonchild - 5/5This song has a very pretty instrumental and the lyrics are wonderful.6.) Sci-Fi Wasabi - 4/5This song is a rap song. I don't think the lyrics mean anything but it's a fun song.7.) Clouds - 5/5This song is one of my favorites. The lyrics are weird and almost unrelatable. However the way it is sung makes it a great song.8.) Speechless - 4/5This song is a rap/R&B-inspired; song. I like it but in some spots there are a few flaws. I particularly like the ending where everyone is singing together.9.) King Of Silence - 2/5This song is easily forgettable. The lyrics have a little meaning but it's carried out poorly in my opinion. This is probably my least favorite song on the album.10.) Blue Train - 3/5This is a 'rock' song. It is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be in my opinion but that's just me. It is catchy... Although it is pretty weird.11.) Sunday Part I - 2.5/5This is Cibo Matto's attempt at a normal rap song. It is very forgettable like 'King Of Silence'. I do like that it leads into the next track though.12.) Sunday Part II - 3/5This song has emotion but it isn't that great of a song. Don't be fooled with the 'Part II' it's nothing like the last track. They're just both about Sunday.13.) Stone - 4/5This song is a really good song. It is filled with emotions. The lyrics are short but they speak a lot in my opinion. One of the better songs on the song.14.) Mortming - 5/5I really like this piece for some reason. Most people probably don't. It is weird and in 4 'pieces'.

" this band has always confounded me a bit. they seem to be good musicians and Yuka Honda apparently is a big name around the new york scene but these Cibo Matto records just do not hold up over time. one of their biggest pitfalls is that they can't decide if they want to be serious or just take the piss and be silly. sure it's cool to do both but when you've got an absolutely stunningly great song on here like 'Stone' on the same album with the cringeworthy 'Lint of Love'...it's just not right. something's gotta give. are you a pop band or a novelty act? it's frustrating because their are some real moments of great pop genius here ( 'Moonchild' 'Sunday Part II') and then horrifying mistakes ( 'Sci-fi Wasabi' 'Blue Train'). well...take it how you want it i guess. it could have been so much more. this band has been gone for some time now but we'll always have 'Know Your Chicken.' heehee ",3.0
" Don't be misled by the other review on here that says this is 'mainstream R&B' and that the album is somehow consciously 'commercial.' Ridiculous. However I can understand the dissatisfied position that that reviewer was coming from. On first listen (which is all I have to go on) Stereotype A seems less exciting or creative than the first album. It sounds like the girls in Cibo Matto really enjoy playing with a full band but the results just aren't as remarkable as the more eclectic sampler-driven stuff on their first album. Practically every song has a laid-back lounge vibe reminiscent of Beck songs like New Pollution and beautiful singing -- which might grow on me but my first impression of this album is that it's well-crafted and 'mature' but sadly this seems to equal boring.

" For women with fuller busts this bra is great...but only for a little while. The company recently switched to metal clasps on all except the black to hold the straps because they were getting too many complaints about the plastic ones breaking...which happened to me at work. There really isn't a risk of the metal ones breaking but the straps have a tendency to slide through the clasps just after wearing it a few times.

" I purchased this bra during a few months in which I was temporarily off of birth control due to needing to renew but waiting for the insurance from the new job to kick in. I was experiencing extreme breast tenderness during ovulation and menstruation to the point that I would go to the bathroom at work and cut the wires out of my nice expensive bras. I decided to purchase a wireless bra for those days so that I could experience some semblance of comfort.When the bra arrived I tried it on and it fit. It supported fairly well. I love that the straps lock into place and don't slide longer as it's worn. However it bears a terrible resemblance to the bullet bras of my grandma's era which is not a look that I prefer. I also have terrible problems with wireless bras not giving me enough separation causing my breasts to touch sweat and chafe regardless of weather/climate control conditions however most of this can be solved by applying deodorant or baby powder. The strap padding is more annoying than effective as it slides around and constantly needs adjustment. If there were a way to hook or fasten it into place that would be ideal.I do like that there are four columns of hooks as the standard three tend to stretch out far to quickly for my taste leading to me taking in the sides or back of my bras - I prefer the bands tight for if I don't have ample support my back lets me know in very unpleasant terms. This bra however does not feel like it will be stretching out at any point in the near future as the fabric has very little elastic.This has been designated to be an at-home-only bra due to the shape and I doubt I'll ever wear it in public. I'm to the point of not caring about seams or trim showing through my top provided the bra does its job of making my boobs round lifted and front and center however this fails on all but lifted. It's perfect if I'm sick cleaning or lounging or if I'll be going somewhere that evening in constrictive undergarments but prefer to be comfortable until it's necessary to change.If the shaper were better I may consider purchasing this bra again however as it is I will not be purchasing another one as I have found an alternate comfy bra that doesn't mis-shape me terribly. Being that I'm now on Implanon I don't have to worry about ovulation OR periods however it's nice to take a break from wires and side boning on occasion. ",3.0
" I decided to try this bra based on my own research indicating it was one of the best wire-free bras available. I work at home and was looking for a less expensive option than my go-to bra (Elomi Energise). Although the Elila is expensive too the price here was reasonable so I decided to give it a try.The support is good. It definitely reminds me of bras that my grandma would wear with that odd pointy shape that it squashes your boobs into. However this is a wire-free bra so I knew that would be the case going into it. Since I was just getting it primarily to wear around the house I was not that concerned.I could not get past the itchy unpleasant feel of the fabric. I would have returned but I had already removed the tags and washed it since that usually helps to soften the fabric. I'm sure if I wore it more frequently it would soften but it felt like torture to me so I haven't been able to do that. However I am extremely sensitive to the feel of the fabric. I have Glamorise bras as well and while they are itchy to start out as well I think they are more comfortable in general (and a more reasonable price).But again the support was good. If you are looking for a wire-free bra that is very supportive and don't mind the shape that this gives you and are okay with breaking in the itchy firm fabric then I think you would be happy with this product. For me I will be investing in the Elomi Energise bra which does have a wire but is ridiculously comfortable flexes with me and has a nice smooth fabric that is not itchy. ",3.0

Us in the united states would most likely argue that our hip-hop in some instances is more about street cred. Where MC Skinner lacks in street cred he makes it up in the expletive heavy HARDEST WAY TO MAKE AN EASY LIVING which to its credit isn't a bad album. However after reading about the hype in a number of magazines and online articles the product was slightly disappointing.There are some genuine hits though they might not be mainstream hits of U.S. hip-hop. It is difficult to get past the fact that Skinner has a very heavy British accent. However tracks like 'Pranging Out' 'The Hardest Way To Make An Easy Living' 'Never Went To Church' and 'All Goes Out The Window' are very good. Even tracks that are more filler material feature exceptional production something that Skinner easily has above some of the producers in the U.S. The indie feel is something that more U.S. artist should explore.However there are missteps here. There are a few corny lines such as the 'cigarettes before matches line' in 'War of The Sexes' which all in all isn't bad. Also some of the songs come over as unrelatable and uninspired and grow rather boring. Even at its best occasionally the constantly looped production does grow a bit monotonous. What is important to understand here though is that Skinner is very different from U.S. hip hop and that is always a refreshment to see somebody who has a different twists on things. I was hoping this album would've been slightly better but I still liked the things that Skinner was doing. 3 stars. ",3.0
" A few years ago there was an explosion of sorts concerning British artists broadening rap like Dizzee Rascal and the Streets. I really couldn't get into it though; the thing that bothered me about Mike Skinner (yes people the Streets refers to ONE person) is that his material didn't sound like rap to me; it sounded more like spoken word. But he does sound more like a rapper on his latest offering The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living.But even though the production is on point the songs as a whole aren't that accessible. And I'm not saying that because Mike's thick accent can make things incomprehensible to the average listener (although there's some truth to that; 'War of the Sexes' anyone?); it's that most of the time I really don't understand what in the world he's talking about which is especially the case with the album's opener 'Prangin Out'.The few times where I COULD figure out what was going on I wasn't too impressed. 'Fake Streets Hats' has Mike complaining about supposedly pirated Streets merchandise (I say 'supposedly' because it turns out that Mike's label distributed the hats) and 'When You Wasn't Famous' is a been-there-done-that comparison of his private and public life. Speaking of that song when Mike and friends try to sing the chorus sometimes it's pretty nerve-racking (see 'Two Nations').I really think Mike could have done a better job than this; it almost feels like he just wanted to put SOMEthing out because now that Lady Sovereign is getting some mainstream love he's like 'Hey remember ME?' Let's hope he perfects his craft; maybe then it won't be so hard to make an easy living.Anthony Rupert ",3.0

" I couldn't find any relatively new information about this product running off of a Mac. Hopefully this'll be helpful to others. My machine is a Santa Rosa Intel 15' Macbook Pro running OSX 10.5 Leopard with 2 GB of memory.First off I'd like to point out that this is pretty much the same exact copy of Topic Entertainment's American Sign Language Deluxe as the other listings on Amazon. All of the copies are both Windows and Mac format all on the same discs.After copying the application to my local drive and running it I would get a series of repeating errors that would eventually lead to the application crashing. I sent in an email to Topic Entertainment's support group. Their response was that their title was only written with the intent of it only running on the system requirements printed on the box which is OSX 10.1 on a G4 and there were no plans to release an update for Leopard. They offered to return my copy for a refund if I wished.Not wanting to take no as an answer I fired up Windows XP SP2 through VMware Fusion and attempted to install the software. Worked like a charm videos are just as crisp as I'd expect them running natively on the Mac and disc swapping works correctly. There was an error during the installation about my copy of Quicktime being newer then the version required and asked me to first uninstall it before restarting the ASL Deluxe installation I clicked ok and the installation continued on as normal.I should also note that I've gone through and created ISO disc images of all eight discs through Windows and am storing them locally on my drive so I don't have to lug around all of the discs at once. This works fine VMware Fusion mounts ISO images without a problem.The software its self is a little clunky. The first disc offers some written words about ASL. What you're buying is on the rest of the discs a vast video library of others showing you words or phrases. I haven't played with it much past that there are some games I haven't touched.I'll update this review when I've had more of a chance to play with the software but for now I wanted to throw up the issues I had installing under 10.5.

" I bought ths terrific little saucepan at the beginning of 2009. It's supposed to have a lifetime warranty (hmmm my lifetime or its?) So far I've had 3 years of very happy cooking with it but the other day I noticed very tiny pock marks on the inside bottom of the pan. I am concerned this may mean deterioration. I've had way too many experiences with non-stick pans so when I purchased this one I also added the Kaiser KaiserFlex Silicone Cooking Spoon to my Amazon order. The only cooking utensils ever used in this or my other new pots and pans are all silicone. I absolutely loved this pan so much I bought the Anolon Advanced 3-1/2-Quart Covered Straining Saucepan a month later. That is strictly my pasta pan -- turns out perfect every time.

" He came into the wrestling business being put in the same spotlight as Andre The Giant & for over the next 15 years he's definitely been one of the most dominate giants in the history of the business. From being 'Andre's son' to the 'World's Largest Athlete' the story of Paul Wight is finally being told. Throughout the documentary you'll hear from his various family & friends along with fellow WWE talents such as William Regal Triple H Arn Anderson Chavo Guerrero Edge John Cena Pat Patterson.The documentary begins with the story of how he was a small town boy (complete with footage from when he was a kid) to have health problems early & a heavy eating habit. How he played basketball with that ending up getting him suspended for 6 months is talked about before going into the story behind the issues with a tumor that caused his overgrowth & stories behind the job he had before going into wrestling. The documentary continues talking about how he was discovered by Hulk Hogan & trained at the WCW Power Plant with Triple H & William Regal commenting on his experiences there before going into how he got the spot that he did resulting in winning the World Championship in his very first match. His ability to be very athletic for his size as far as speed coming off the top rope and doing moves likes dropkicks were heavily discussed before going into the problems he had in WCW with Triple H having his own theory of what went wrong there. The story behind Show's WWE debut at the St. Valentine's Day Massacre PPV was talked about next before going into how he was miserable in his early WWE career before talking about how certain veterans like Undertaker helped mentor him. A big highlight of the documentary happened next as the real life story behind the storyline with Big Boss Man in regards to his father's death was heavily discussed including why they had to take a more comedic approach as the storyline went along as opposed to keeping it serious. His first WWE Championship win the concept behind his entertaining impressions and his reasoning behind his time in the OVW developmental territory are discussed before talking about his dominance in the ring with such highlights as when him & Brock Lesnar broke the ring. We get a tour of his personal traveling bus along with the story behind why he got it & what he brought to the ECW brand was discussed before going into his new training methods that helped him lose weight & stay healthy with the feud with Floyd Mayweather (including getting his nose broken) & his acting roles (Knucklead Waterboy SNL) finish out the documentary.Matches Include",3.0
" I bought this trainer a few years ago and spend the winters riding about 7 hours per week on it. The noise level was GREAT for the first few years but it has recently gotten much louder and is almost impossible to hear any TV/DVD audio once riding it. My guess is that most trainers get louder after a lot of use but I'm looking to replace it after a few years of use due to the noise issue. ",3.0
" When I first started using the trainer I could not understand the comments made about the noise as right out of the box it is very quite and I could easily hear the TV music my kids etc. However I have now put about 30 hours and about 500 miles on it and it is LOUD. The wheel makes a loud clicking noise that progressively gets worse. When I watch the TV while I ride on the trainer the TV slowly gets turned up until my wife comes in and asks why the TV is so loud. I rated this 3 stars because it is average which is unfortunately what I expected. I did not want to spend the money on a fluid trainer so I got the Magneto based on reviews and recommendations. I do not regret buying this and I would do it again but I have been on cheaper trainers that are this loud as well. ",3.0
" This tape prove that Sills needs a microphone to be heard. I agree she has the most fabulous bel canto technique. But to hear her in person. Well let's just say you can't hear her too well.

It's on cd so you can hear her loud and clear. Her singing is awesome and so is Gedda. They hit some pretty high stuff in that opera. But fair warning...if you don't like Bellini you'll hate it.

" This trainer mostly does its job. My biggest complaints are that it is very noisy (which is annoying in an apartment building) and the resistance is not very strong (fine if you are going for an easy ride but not quite enough if you are trying to do high intensity intervals). My roommate has the Cyclops Mag which is both quieter and provides more resistance. For this reason I usually end up borrowing hers. The bar mounted shifter only makes very slight changes in the resistance. If I was buying the trainer again I'd save the $20 and buy theCycleOps Mag Indoor Bicycle Trainer ",3.0
" Trainer was easy to put together and looks sturdy. I can't comment on how well it works because I haven't been able to use it due to the one flaw I mention in the title of the review. Nowhere does it say that your bike needs to have a rear wheel with a quick release skewer to be able to use this trainer. It wasn't until I got to that part of the installation that I realized I would need to buy a new wheel to be able to use the skewer they provide that locks into the trainer. Maybe that's an obvious thing that I should have known about but I was unaware. I could use a new wheel so I'm not too upset about it but you should know about this before you decide to buy the trainer. ",3.0
" It is very simple to put together and mounting your bike is even easier. This would be perfect for a person looking for a light workout but it does not provide enough resistence for a serious bike rider. The tension adjustments are barely noticable.

" If a slightly Nashville Bob Dylan with Keith Richard licks sounds like it might be your kind of thing some of this will please. This journeyman musician writes like a dream in spots songs like 'Hot and Cold' 'Poor' 'I'm on to You' and 'Blow' have classic hooks that sound like they must have been popular songs a few decades ago for the Byrds in their country phase or someone like that.Not everything sounds that way 'Ready or Not' has kind of a sludgy Jethro Tull sound to it and it doesn't work very well besides. And regarding 'Death Trip' personally I'd just as soon not have an Aussie Neal Young bitching about us when his own vermin-riddled country is hardly virgin. Hmmph.

" Chald if I didn't see it I wouldn't have believed it. Goya drew a photo of someone lighting a lamp by flatuating on it! Today some call that 'fart lighting.' Whoa! It was a trip seeing something like that in a serious documentary.This work had many scholars providing interviews as opposed to just having only two. The narrator has poor Spanish pronunciation. He said 'Josefa' as if the E was a short English one. He said 'Cadiz' as if the last syllable was a short English I. The documentary is filled with grainy reenactments that some may not be able to see. I found the inclusion distracting.Like Beethoven and Edison Goya went deaf. Those interested in famous people with disabilities may want to read more about that. Perhaps it would make for a good paper in a disability studies class. I'm shocked to learn that Goya was targeted by the Inquisition because I would have assumed that body died approximately 100 years before his adulthood. The narrator contrasted how other countries were embracing the Enlightenment while Spain ignored it. This reminded me of how Franco spent myriad years ruling Spain at a time when other countries staunchly rejected Fascism.Most viewers know Goya for his formal non-controversial works. This documentary proved that he made dark and risqu'e paintings that could still be seen as shocking. ",3.0
" This Side of the Sky is a beautiful story of two life long friends Myraleen and Lilian who grew up in Nadir Mississippi and went on to see and experience the world. Sometimes tragic yet always poignant Ms. Singleton's novel is an enthralling read. The time period of this novel spans over 70 years- from the 1930s when the girls lived with the constant reminder that the color of their skin precluded them from reaching the highest heights to the year 2000 when color is a hue on one spectrum.It took a good 50 pages to draw me into the characters. Many times Myraleen and Lilian looked at the same situation from different perspectives. I found it amazing how captivating their friendship was. It endured a lifetime with hardly a disagreement or regret. Ms. Singleton's research made This Side of the Sky come to life. The historical accuracy of the plight of African American's during periods of social change in our country kept the characters fresh and my enthusiasm to read was intensified. The social aspects of their relationships with others made reading multidimensional. I even received an education learning that there was a far greater contingent of African Women who served as part of the Women's Auxiliary Corps in World War II than I imagined. Rising from seemingly hopeless childhoods to become well-rounded well-traveled well-versed ladies who enjoyed their lives This Side of the Sky drew me in and kept me until the end. ",3.0

" This book is okay. It is a detailed look into glass science-good for finding specifics about glass without having to search through the journals. But readers be wary there are many mistakes amongst these pages. Pay particular caution to derivations and figures-I've had to correct many mistakes the author himself pointed out during lectures. My suggestion for getting the most of the book is to read James Shelby's 'Introduction to Glass Science' first for a solid understanding then delve into the same topic in 'Fundamentals of Inorganic Glasses.' If this is for class good luck! ",3.0

" Before you spend $250 on what at first glance might appear to be a new edition of Oppenheim be aware that this is reprint of the 3rd edition (the last one written by Oppenheim himself) which came out in the first part of the 20th century (can't remember the exact date; after 1912 but before 1940). This is NOT a new edition.The most recent edition is the 9th of Part 1 only edited by Sir Robert Jennings and Sir Arthur Watts in 1992. The most recent edition of Part 2 is the 7th edited by Hersch Lauterpacht in the 1950s. If you want the most recent editions of Oppenheim's International Law those are the ones to get not this one.Having given this general warning I grant that Oppenheim's International Law remains one of the classics of the field and is one of the most authoritative sources if a little dated. It is well organized and relatively easy to read. ",3.0
" The only worthwhile part of this book is when Purcell intrerviews people who Flash for as a job and questions them on techniques tips and tricks. These pages are very helpful (especially sound). You can tell Purcell himself is no an artist. If you check out the tutorials he wrote they're just so stupid and not useful (fighting skunks a walking ostrich etc.). However the CD is great and hearing pros talk about Flash is something new it's a worth a buy but don't bother with the tutorials they're a waste of time. ",3.0
" Faces (John Cassavettes 1968)I have to rank myself among those having seen Faces who understand its importance in the film world but can't bring themselves to like the movie. I understand why Cassavettes did the things he did with this movie why the film is supersaturated and the sound mix is awful and all the other little quirks that kept this so far away from Hollywood and its subject matter is conceptually brilliant; the question one has to put to oneself is whether you're actually going to be able to sit through two hours plus of what is essentially boring and obnoxious cocktail-party banter even after the cocktail party itself is long over.The main characters in Faces are a married couple Richard and Maria Forst (John Marley and Lynn Carlin) who have found their marriage going stale and in response each flirts with the idea of finding a younger lover. The results of their dalliances however are anything but the pleasant no-strings-attached sex each was hoping for; in fact the consequences are potentially disastrous.It's a great idea and I do like the way it's carried off most of the time. Technically it's a brilliant approach to the subject; Cassavettes gives us washed-out characters in a washed-out film bending every aspect of the moviemaking process to the psyches of the people he's got in front of the camera. And the script works right along with that premise; if you have washed-out characters in a washed-out film what other sort of dialogue should they have saved washed out? Unfortunately however this has always been my problem with 'The Dead' that short story of James Joyce's that everyone but me seems to love. My take on it is that Joyce was subscribing to the hypothesis 'if you want to write a story about boring people write a boring story'. And the story certainly succeeds beyond any reasonable bounds in that regard which I assume is why so many people like it. Similarly Faces; Cassavettes has done a fantastic job of it here though substituting 'washed-out' (I can't imagine anyone calling these folks 'boring'). And it's a deft and proficient depiction of the characters. It's the characters themselves that get on my nerves. *** ",3.0
" The trademark of John Cassavetes films is emotions laid bare. You might call this an emotion strip tease without the tease. This film is no exception. However it is not as focused as his later Woman Under the Influence or Opening Night. Some scenes loose their effectiveness by their length. A tighter editing would have worked wonders. Nevertheless the film has a strong emotional impact a harbinger of his later films and arresting structural innovations; well worth watching. ",3.0
" Watch the lives of a group of list-sisters unfold through a series of messages between them and their families and through two email loops. While the primary email loop is called the SAHM I AM loop and moderated by the self righteous Rosalyn there is a secondary one Green Eggs and Ham in which the more disgruntled members diss Ros and her toady Connie. Through the months covered crises frequently pop up; marital woes adoption and fertility issues child rearing catastrophes past mistakes that need to be paid for in the present and health issues that may not be life threatening but are heart breaking. Rosalyn's life is not as trouble free and June Cleaverish as she pretends on the loop and her facade could collapse if her sister is allowed to join the group because Ronnie knows the truth that Ros is not a Proverbs 31 ideal woman.*** While there is no one main plot a series of subplots threads together. Though this lack of coherence is a definite drawback the characters are so true to life that there is something endearing about this novel. Anyone who has been on a loop with a troll will be doing their best bobble head impression nodding along with the on target descriptions of the reactions of the Green Eggs group to the bad aspects of the SAHM one. Yet there is also the very positive light that is shone on how supportive and true email friends can be. *** ",3.0

" This is an amusing if slightly odd story. I guess that Ruskin considered himself such an intellectual jack of all trades that he'd a have a go at the genre if only to say he'd done it.The story is built from familiar parts. There's a Cinderella theme built around a young boy and his two cruel brothers. There's also a theme of the wandering stranger who after being treated well or poorly rewards the doer equally well or poorly. In fact that was such a cool idea that Ruskin threw in two magical beings quite independent of each other making the front and back halves of this little creature look like thay came from two different animals.It's a pleasant enough fairy tale but not one that I'd spend a lot of time hunting down.//wiredweirdPS",3.0
" In this book Petroski brings up a few good points. Engineering is human. Engineers as oppose to what some think are not perfect. They are not able to create a perfect design for the given problem. They create what they believe is the best solution for the given design specifications. They along with others test their solution in theory. The majority of these solutions are created and succeed perfectly. Although most of these designs are successful some are not.It seems to be most of the failures of designs happen when it deals with something big including the Kansas City Hyatt Regency Hotel walkways which killed over 100 people or the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. These failures become famous and the engineers are the first ones to be looked at.Along with engineering success comes failure. This is a part of being human. Human engineering will always have its failures along with its successes. When engineers build something they analyze it to determine if their solution is the best solution. Sometimes it takes a failure for the engineers to see their failures and to correct the problem. This book tries to explain this and does in most cases. In some of the cases it leaves the reader wondering what else could have been done or what needs to be done in the future to prevent these failures. ",3.0

" 'Operation Condor' is similar in style to 'Rush Hour' or 'Mr. Nice Guy'. These are examples of Chan`s later movies in which he tries to burst through to America by breaking free from his Hong Kong roots. The production values are far glossier than his earlier movies - this one is shot on location in the Phillipines Spain and Morroco. In the film Chan and three female friends (one Japanese one Chinese one German) journey into the desert to find hidden gold - and get into comic scrapes. Sadly the version I saw featured appallingly sloppy dubbing into English which made it feel as if the film was produced in the U.S not Hong Kong. In a bizarre way this works to Chan`s advantage. He works well with the supporting cast generally fooling around and displaying a fine line in comic timing and Buster Keaton style slapstick which is very entertaining. A good fun film. Don`t expect a kung-fu classic like 'Fist Of Fury' because you won`t get it. But remember Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee are different. Chan was trained to entertain his audience and this film will entertain all who see it. ",3.0
" Jackie Chan is a physical genius and thistogether with a sense of comedy and an air of winning self-deprecationhelp set his movies apart from those of other action stars such as the wooden Van Damme and the pompous dirigible Seagal.The physical skills are well in evidence here as are the comedy traits -although personally I find them less well showcased this time aroundOperation Condor is clearly an expensive movie and makes widespread use of well photographed North African and European locations in its tale of Chan and some female colleagues hunting abandoned Nazi gold in the face of opposition from Arab terrorists and one of the gold's former owners.There are draggy bits in the middle when the story gets bogged down in broad comedic interludes and the dubbing throughout is execrable.All is forgiven when it comes to the climax -an elongated fight scene in a wind tunnel that has flair pace and panache.The end credits show the injury sustained by Chan in making the movie when a stunt went wrong-proof that here is an action star who does not stint on placing himself on the line .Four stars for Chan -and marked down only for the dubbing and the misfiring comedy scenes which simply dont travel well to Occidental audiences ",3.0

" What you can learn from reading other reviews! As my wife sat and watched this movie I kept thinking that the big explosion at the end reminded me of another movie..the far superior LONG KISS GOODNIGHT. And now that I have read the other reviews I see where they used footage from CLIFFHANGER and NARROW MARGIN. Hmmm...studios will go to extreme lengths to make movies huh?As far as the rest of the movie goes Treat Williams is all but lost in a small role as the CIA special agent with the warped sense of humor. Most of the focus is given to the budding romance of John Beck and Susan Blakeley survivors of the ridiculously staged plane crash. Add Bongo the Bear and a subdued Steve Franken and there's even more foolishness. Not to mention the other survivors who go off on their own; one dies from unknown causes; the stupid wildlife t.v. star (hah) shows her stupidity by firing a gun and causing an avalance that wipes out everyone except the two lovebirds who have just reconciled. We also have a crooked pilot a diabetic man and his daughter and oh yes a Tessla device that uses brainwaves to cause nuclear destruction.Why the three stars? The scenery is beautiful; I found myself interested in spite of myself and some of the performances were enjoyable particularly Ms. Blakeley's alcoholic writer. But the big 'character development' scenes only served to slow down the movie's overall pacing. But considering the theft from other movies one can only laugh and say gee whiz!!! ",3.0
" For and 'original work' how could the producers and director hope to get away with the 'Cliffhanger' 'Narrow Margin' and 'A Long Kiss Goodnight' cut and paste scenes. These are not copies these are the actual scenes from the movies cut and pasted into this one. My son about fell out of his chair as we watched the plane and helicopter sequences the chases and train sequenses the semi truck sequences and climactic explosion that we had seen from other movies. He wanted to know if those actors got royalties off of this movie especially Craig Berko who was clearly seen but not credited.That aside there were many cliche moments some good lines and some very bad dialog. But it was worth watching especially with someone who does not know (or even one who does but hasn't yet seen it) about the cut and paste because it makes for a hilarious (absolutely unintended by the makers I'm sure) movie experience and a great conversation after the movie among friends. I have never had such an experience before... ",3.0
" Jerry Stahl seems to be able to find the sarcastic and sardonic humor in even the most downtrodden lives. 'I Fatty' is a firsthand account of Fatty Arbuckle's tumultuous life. It's written very simply and helps us to imagine the inner turmoil of being an outsider in a judgemental society.Born to an abusive father in Kansas Arbuckle turned to theatre as an escape from a bitter life. He rose to fame in the cinema and at one point was more popular than Chaplin. He was the first screen actor to make a million dollars a year.But in 1921 he was accused of the rape and murder of actress Virginia Rappe. He was slandered by the press and not even his acquittal could save his career. He eventually lost everything.Stahl emphasizes the mental anguish of being fat impotent and presumed guilty. He also shows the role that heroin played in Fatty Arbuckle's life. Heroin was readily available and legal at the time and he became addicted using it as a pain killer after a botched medical procedure. Towards the end of his years his servant used heroine as a tool to get Arbuckle to divulge all of his secrets.I had the pleasure of hearing Stahl read from the book and it was quite entertaining. He joked that it is obligatory for him to include heroin in every one of his novels. He emphasizes the public outcry against Fatty as being led by a conservative anti-Hollywood element. I would agree but would also like to point out that in the 1920s journalists had more leeway to embelish the truth and print it as fact. Even today the press chooses to emphasize some facts over others and often slanders people in the process.If you are interested in the life of one of Hollywood's first stars and if you like dark humor 'I Fatty' is for you. It's a good read that will make you think and give you a laugh or two. ",3.0
" Roscoe Arbuckle was a fat man who lived a tragic life. He was born in Kansas to an abusive father and invalid mother. The father taunted him for his considerable girth while beating him with a strap. Roscoe ran away after a year or so of grammer school to hit the boards in vaudeville.Underneath the all too too sullied flesh there was a good brain and warm heart. Fatty became famous as a star comedian along with opium addicted Mabel Normand in the Keystone Cop flicks. Fatty knew them all-Chaplin Keaton and Lloyd. He was the first Hollywood star to make a million dollars a year and was loved by the vast American public who enjoyed a night at the flickers.Along the way he engaged in many bad habits such as heroin and opium usage excessive eating and drinking enough to drown several grown men. He was known as 'The Prince of Whales.' Arbuckle was always well dressed knew his lines and was eager to help newcomers in the business.Fatty's life went down the spout when he was accused of the rape and murder of the floozy Virginia Rappe in a St. Francis Hotel Room in San Francisco. Fatty endured three trials and terrible publicity. He was finally acquitted but his career was in shambles. He went on to direct a few movies under an assumed name and opened a nightclub but the damage had been done to his career. Fatty married three times endured several physical afflictions and was the first big star whose scandal gave Hollywood a bad reputation in middle America.Jerry Stahl has done his research on the Arbuckle life and career. Arbuckle (1887-1933) was an important figure in early film comedy who deserves to be studied. ",3.0
" Let me begin by stressing that Jerry Stahl is by all means a good writer. I FATTY is an enjoyable read in some ways; but also a distressful one particularly to fans of silent film comedian Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle. Johnny Depp is quoted as describing the novel as 'the true skinny' on the comedian. With all due respect to this very talented actor I am somewhat puzzled by his statement. Having read the novel twice I found the Roscoe of Stahl's novel to be pretty much a bitter rudely-spoken and generally depressing incarnation which is hardly synonymous with how Roscoe's friends and associates remembered him. Though I cannot be certain of course it seems to me that Stahl's main motive for writing this novel stems from a fascination in a life which certainly was plagued by much pain and injustice. Roscoe had a very sad childhood left alone to his violent alcoholic father after his mother's early death and constantly teased at school for his overweight; and while he admirably managed to outwin much of the traumas of his early years going on to become one of the most celebrated film comedians of his time his career was ruined after he was wrongly accused of rape and manslaughter in 1921. Roscoe played the sidekick of Charlie Chaplin early on in the latter's film career and was the one who directly introduced Buster Keaton to the world of celluloid.A fascinating subject for a novel no doubt. However the fact that all persons directly involved in Roscoe's life have in all probability deceased by now should not mean that ehtical deference can be ignored altogether. The events described does not require that far a dive into the past after all; the scandal which ruined Roscoe's life happened less than a hundred years ago. In my opinion Stahl far too seldom seems to take into consideration that his characters are based on real human beings. Perhaps this is a matter of necessity from an author's point of view; in order to make a character come alive on the page focus on plain facts may indeed be a hindrance. A character based solely on facts and authentic observations would possibly turn out too realistic to be believable in the context of a novel. Yet what troubles me most with I FATTY is that it recalls Roscoe's entire story seemingly first-hand from his perspective and I'm not convinced that the book's admission of being a 'novel' on the cover will prevent people less acquainted with Arbuckle's life to interpret too much of this as the truth or close to it (Charles Nordhoff and James N. Hall's novel 'Mutiny on the Bounty' and its arguably inaccurate portrayal of Captain Bligh comes to mind).A few distressing examples",3.0
" Some of this book may be true. Jerry Stahl has thoughtfully included an impressive bibliography for us to mull over.But a lot of this is known to be untrue. So I had to drop a couple of stars off what otherwise is a pretty readable biography of Roscoe. He didn't like the sobriquet 'Fatty' you know.Stahl has a breezy pitter-patter style that keeps you turning pages even though it wears thin occasionally.But the real problem I have with the book is it seems apparent to me he just doesn't like Arbuckle very much. He gives the misfortune of the great fat man too much credence as if Roscoe deserved what he got.In the mid 70s I was in Hollywood trying to break into acting. For amusement my girlfriend and I chased down infamous old Tinsel Town addresses as we boned up on the angst their former owners had experienced. Arbuckle's house on West Adams is still there but by then no one believed any of the stories about Roscoe's 'parties'. He had become a tragic figure an example of Moviedom overreaction to what should have been page 6 minor news.I respect Stahl for researching and writing this book. I just wish he'd stuck closer to the truth. ",3.0
" It's not a bad book really. It just drags a bit. I never felt like I was in the head of Fatty Arbuckle telling his story. I felt instead like I was reading someone trying a bit too hard to speak like him. It comes off as stilted and after a while makes the book a chore.There's an interesting story here especially since the subject matter is so tragic. The man was railroaded and ruined because of it. His fall from grace was an awful thing and you really feel for the guy when you learn about his story.Unfortunately this isn't the best telling of that story. He doesn't even make the character that likable and gets some of the historical facts completely wrong.Stahl is a great writer so I wanted something better than this. It's slow and frankly just not that interesting. ",3.0
" The concept of I Fatty is a good one--a novel written as if it is the autobiography a controversial historical figure. I can't quite pinpoint it but somehow I just could not consistently feel like I was 'in the head' of Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle. Some chapters feel 'real' but others are wooden. Some parts of the book just did not feel like first person narratives. ",3.0
" This review pertains to the 2004 Collector's Edition DVD transfer and likely the 4-movie DVD bundle too.Tremors is a great movie and always a guilty pleasure.

Now I bought the DVD and it is the worst video transfer I've ever seen.I can't believe they released something this bad. The picture is grainy during all scenes",3.0
" The film Tremors is as good as ever - campy funny silly and lots of fun. However this HD-DVD transfer is not worthy of the medium. The transfer improvement consists only of heavily over-sharpened footage (artifacts and edge halos) and way too much contrast.
