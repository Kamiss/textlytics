" Disc One (73",5.0
" Yes indeed the game was beautiful. Too bad no one really knows about it. When i played the game I absolutely loved it. A true masterpiece one of squaresofts best by far. But when I got the Soundtrack it was mind blowing. Every Song was on it. Plus the caftsmanship from the director was just overwhelming. The game and soundtrack by far are the best in squaresofts history. Never has there been a great combination. From Listening threw out Disc one which features some really cool Resident Evil only in symphony mode. Yes this Soundtrack is by far the best Video Game soundtrack that I have ever gotten. All I have to say is get the game first once you beat it. Get the soundtrack next. You'll know what I mean by what a true RPG game and music is all about. ",5.0
" With Vagrant Story Sakimoto expertly combines dissonance ambience and melody to create a simply gorgeous videogame score. In fact I'm going to call it one of Squaresoft's best. There is not one dud in the soundtrack. It's even better in-game but buy the soundtrack! ",5.0
" The only critiscm I have about this sound track are the two bonus tracks (which don't appear in the game and add nothing to the preceding tracks on the cds) and the strange morph that one of the tracks (I believe that it is Escape) takes turning from a good piece of music into something that seems to have escaped from the eighties.Apart from that I can't recommend this OST highly enough especially Disc 2 - Track 29 -Staff Roll which unlike the other tracks on the disc is an acoustic Strings Piece that really shows off Hitoshi Sakimoto's talents as a composer. ",5.0
" When I heard the first few tracks of this OST in an ill-fated battle track contest I can't say I was too impressed. They seemed to be rather bland and even downright boring. However I used to also think the same thing about the Final Fantasy Tactics soundtrack which I now adore. That and I'm not the type to give up on an entire soundtrack after listening to just a few songs once or twice.That said I took it upon myself to find the Vagrant Story soundtrack and I forced myself to listen to it. Several times. Dozens of times even. I played it on the PC. In the car and my portable players. Eventually it began to grow on me. I began to appericiate its incredibly dark ambience its undeniable intelligence the wonderful quality of the synth and the sheer complexity of the compositions a delight for people like me who like to analyze things.I think I first realized 'I love this soundtrack' when I felt shivers running down my spine while listening to the end of 'Climax of the Grayland Case.' How beautiful! Or maybe it was when it thought to myself 'That heavy piano playing really does remind me of iron!' while listening to 'Iron Crab'. Or perhaps it was when I was listening to 'Staff Roll' and it made my day a little happier when the main melody kicked in at around 4",5.0
" Excellent stockings for long shifts on your feet - not too tight not too loose...garment integrity is longer than package states (with proper care). ",5.0
" After I had a DVT my doctor required me to wear compression stockings. I wore ugly white TED hose and yucky thick brown stockings. Then I found Jobst UltraSheer. They gave me the compression I needed (15-20) but looked like regular pantyhose. Even though my blood clot has been gone for 4 years I still buy these to wear as support stockings because they make my legs feel so nice.**Note I have problems with the rubberized tops rolling down my thigh. I tried the Jobst adhesive but I hated having my skin pulled all day. I bought an inexpensive garter belt and it works fine and helps keep the stockings from rolling. ",5.0
" My doctor recommended the thigh high version of this product but I became very aggravated with them constantly rolling down through the course of the day. They were never comfortable.

" I've always had pain in my legs during long travels either by car or plane when you can't move very much. I used them for a recent trip consisting on 6 flights total and I could feel the difference. I wasn't totally stiff when I got off the planes. They do stay in place with the band at the top. Just be careful they tear as easily as stockings. If you'll use them much you better get a couple of extra pairs. ",5.0

" I thoroughly enjoyed Rising Sons and Daughters. I don't know of any other book that looks at Japanese society from the point of view of its young people poised as they are between their parents' age-old Japanese culture of restraint and obedience to the will of the community and their peers' adulation of Western culture. True to form the 'New Young' of Japan seem to be creating an 'international' blend as the Ando family demonstrates in this beautifully written book of vignettes of the private lives of members of this family. Steven Wardell is clearly a talented young author adopted for some of his schooling into this family of four teens and thus able to view family life in Japan from the inside out. A great read! ",5.0

" Joy in God--necessary? Or simply optional??? John Piper explains why that if Christ is to be the sun at the center of the solar system of our lives then He must also be our supreme joy over all other 'lesser treasures.' Glorifying God can only be done from a heart that is glad in God. Deep joy in God is the true foundation for all obedience; treasuring Him over all things is the only Christ-exalting motivation to endure suffering...especially to willfuly choose suffering.Show it to your Youth Group Men's/Women's Group or Home Bible Study. Set your church ablaze with a passion for the glory of God in the supremacy of Christ over all things in this world. Everything being fueled by a Spirit produced joy and satisfaction in the Lord Himself--to His praise and renoun!Only because of grace--Jeffrey ",5.0
" Piper has a passion for the glory of Christ that is contagious. I've watched these videos multiple times and glean something from it every time. Amazing that he presents this MEATY material to a youth group and they are transfixed the entire time.I don't really care for the youth interviews but I understand given the format of the original presentation. I've used this in a men's group and all enjoyed the material and we had some great discussions.I'd recommend to anybody.

" Though it would be nice to have a solid polished brass fireplace screen this product certainly fits our needs. For the price it looks quite attractive and provides what we wanted in safety. It sets off our polished brass in our living room and serves the purpose to protect against accidents for our granddaughters. Quick service on delivery as well. ",5.0
" We were surprised. Pleasantly.A weighty perfect model of this classic screen would certainly not be available for anything close to the price of the Uniflame model but the Uniflame looks amazingly good anyway. This thing does the trick!We bought it to replace an 'original' solid brass model costing nearly $500 (and it's cheap construction design eventually giving way to its heaviness when moved). As long as someone doesn't examine the new screen from close-up it actually looks better (not really terrible at all close-up) and it's lighter weight makes it easy to handle.JRT ",5.0
" This is an excellent fireplace screen for the price. I was somewhat surprised at how light the screen is as compared to other fireplace screens I have in the house. You certainly won't have a hard time moving it away from the fireplace. I actually purchased it to put in front of a gas fireplace in order to make the fire look more authentic and it does the job !

" Product arrived on the third day after I ordered despite a delivery estimate of 7-10 days. I'm impressed with both the product and the marketplace seller (PrimeNetShops). The screen came well packaged and in good shape. One of the decorative knobs on top had come unscrewed and was in the bottom of the box but it re-attached with ease. It's light enough that it can be moved with ease but still feels sturdy enough that it should last for years to come. Great product great experience. Everything that is right about Amazon all in one order! ",5.0

If ya love Tx rap you've gotta get this 1. Somethin to kickback & blow big too somethin to jam in the ride. So underrated right here.

" This book contains a great amount of vocabulary. It teaches you the Anglicized versions of certain words such as 'teacher' but it also gives you the Yoruba word. Although I didn't appreciate the Anglicized words at first they are good to know because a lot of people use them. The CD is an excellent and necessary addition to the book. There are lots of dialogues and lists of vocabulary on them (there are 2 CDs). The CD does skip over some of the exercises in the book which I guess you're supposed to go over by yourself or with a teacher though. All in all it's a great set and if mastered can bring the user to a high level of fluency. I also like that the narrator who speaks English to announce the lessons is a native speaker and doesn't butcher the names of the characters in the dialogues. There is a Yoruba book/CD set created by another publisher who uses a British narrator. It really throws you off course throughout the CD. Watch out for that one and buy this one instead! ",5.0

" My 4 year old daughter LOVES this game. She sings the 'Strike Up The Band and Clap Your Hands for Kelly's Pet Parade!' song around the house. She can dress the Kelly kids 'train' each pet (teach the pony to jump etc.) clean and get the animals ready for the parade (paint the elephant's toe nails etc.) and decorate the floats...all by herself. She'll get everything ready (showing me everything she has accomplished along the way) and then we'll watch her special parade. A wonderfully cute game that I highly recommend.She can mostly do the entire game on her own. I have it installed on a laptop so she is actually using the inset mouse and can still do the game. The only one she has a tough time with is the Polar Bear catching fish game. It's tricky to move your finger on the mouse pad and click at the same time to catch the fish. It would be much easier using a regular mouse. ",5.0

" If you've played this game in the arcade and liked it then you'll definitely like this version to play at home whenever you like. You don't need a supercomputer to run it and the graphics and controls are amazing and faithful to the incredibly fun and fast arcade experience. This version also has plenty of unlockables which you get by playing and earning miles as well as mini-games that are a fun diversion from the classic arcade game. It has the European-themed levels of Outrun2 and the America-themed levels of Outrun2 SP for a total of 30 stages to race through in the classic Outrun-branching style or sequentially or with challenges such as beating rival racers. This game is affordable fun and has plenty of replay value. You may not want to play it for hours and hours but you'll keep coming back to it if you like to get a speedy arcade fix every now and then. ",5.0
" I remember playing Outrun in the arcades when it came out in the I think it was eighties. It had flashy graphics flashy steering wheel pedals and corny but catchy music. It was the kind of game I'd play on the way out of the arcade when all but the last dribbles of coinage had been spent on the more 'serious' (read challenging) games. Actually when I think about it Outrun was always placed by the entrance perhaps for this reason. Main meal of games inside followed by quick dessert on the way out. And Outrun is quick. And fun. And flashy. Colourful pretty and simple. Not much depth here but some very cool twists on your standard arcade racer. Lots of different Ferraris lots of different scenery and wow does it look good! Pure unadulterated eye candy. Two problems however. It wont run on full accelerated sound on my sound card (budget Creative) so I have to switch the acceleration back to minimum through my control panel or the game will just keep crashing when it comes time to race. Secondly the configuration for gamepad bites. It won't allow me to allocate the buttons I want for acceleration and braking so I end up using the right analogue joystick for both (left to accelerate right to brake). Sounds dicky and I suppose it is but it's actually pretty easy to get used to. As far as I'm aware there are no patches for said problems. Despite these issues Outrun 2006 C2C is a blast fun from go to wo. It's sugary sweet and just the thing for a low gaming BSL. ",5.0

" Thanks to my grandparents who came to America in the first decade of the 20th century I grew up and have had a good life. Thanks to my grandparents I didn't become a piece of ash or a few tossed out bones in an Eastern European field at the age of 2. Wars are wars; they've occured throughout human history but in most of them whole civilizations didn't disappear. But the Eastern European Jewish world is gone forever. I might belong to the same gene pool but compared to the characters in Isaac Bashevis Singer's stories I'm as American as apple pie. Irish-Americans can discover their roots in Ireland Chinese-Americans in China and so on but not me. My cultural roots are gone forever. The only way I can learn them is through reading literature written by Singer Shalom Aleichem Isaac Babel and others who describe that vanished world. So obviously my interest and pleasure in reading such wonderful tales as appear in THE SEANCE and OTHER STORIES is all the more. Never mind my personal reasons. These amazing stories by a Nobel Prize winner will stay with you for a long time. The strange sad characters afflicted by poverty and by life bring us face to face with common human personalities of all times and places while also depicting the conditions and peculiar relationships of Jews in Poland too. Magic religion animals thieves rabbis prostitutes mystics Holocaust survivors Talmudic scholars prisoners books butchers and shopkeepers crowd the pages. In each story you find pathos and tragedy happiness and satisfaction tensions and transformations. Two of the stories 'The Seance' and 'The Letter Writer' must rank with the best stories I have ever read; none of the others are bad. If you have never read Singer this is an excellent book to start with. If you have you know what I am talking about. This is the great writer at the top of his form. ",5.0
" Isaac Bashevis Singer was no doubt one of the greatest short story writers - ever! The various collections in the end also earned him a very well deserved Nobel Prize for literature in 1978. Several of his stories were first published in magazines like The New Yorker Encounter and Playboy. The first collection I read was Passions and Other Stories which immediately made me realise what a master Isaac Bashevis Singer was. Later I have read several of his novels and short stories where especially the collections Gimpel the Fool Short Friday and The Seance are at least as good as Passions. All a magnificent world of Isaac Bashevis Singer's saints and sinners. Sad funny ironic poignant and seeming to come from Singer's pen without any efforts. This is what good short stories is all about! ",5.0

" Of many CDs I've purchased in the last couple of years this easily ranks as one of the best. Kudos to Muse for finally recording Spaulding as a leader in 1988 and now to Joel Dorn for reissuing the disk.As the title indicates 'Brilliant Corners' is filled with music by Monk. But what stands out is the freshness of the interpretations of the master's pieces. Rather than simply trying to sound like Monk Spaulding and his cohorts try -- very successfully -- to make music that builds on Monk's ideas.Spaulding tears through every solo he has on alto and offers beautiful contrast with his flute playing as on 'Let's Cool One.' He's aided by trumpeter Wallace Roney who abandons his occasional propensity for imitating Miles Davis and instead lets his own sound shine through. Pianist Mulgrew Miller has never sounded better. In fact the whole group (Ron Carter on bass and Kenny Washington on drums) strongly delivers the message that they are playing music that they love. There is no better way to express that love than by offering the robust voicings that you hear on this disk.If there is a regret when you listen to this music it is that Spaulding who contributed so much to Blue Note dates in the '60s has had so few opportunities to further explore his own muse. Better late than never. ",5.0
" Story goes that after a number of excellent second horn sessions on mid 60's Blue Note where flute.altoand soprano were wielded masterfully by James Spaulding he was given a shot as a leader.He was the non star(leader) that was called in manymany times.But at the point he got his offer Direction/Production had switched from Alfred Lion to Francis Wolff and A&R; fro Ike Quebec to Duke Pearson.Bottom line was they offered Spaulding a shot if he would fit into the new funky blues idiom of the Liberty era and he refused not being true to the hard bop form.Well even though he recorded few albums as a leader latter on labels like Muse('Smile Of The Snake' and 'Blues Nexus are also fine 4 star or better efforts).He he has and excellent session with Wallace Ronney on trumpetMulgrew Miller and Ron Carter on bass and Kenny Washington on drums.Fine line up.And though there are so many Monk tribute Lp's it is the musicianship wielded with passion that makes this a cut of above.As mentioned his flute playing is fine.I find jazz flute hit or miss and here it just works fine.Not a direct copy of the Monk style it shows th timeless of the compositions (not that a total analogue LP with some personal character is bad-see Walter Davis Jr. piano solo 'In Walked Thelonius').I'd call this no an essential Lp but for Monk fans it may be.CheersChazz ",5.0
" Few pieces of music in the history of the gramophone can have suffered such indignities at the hands of insensitive record producers as Saint-Sans's Third Symphony. A glance through the catalogues might suggest one is spoiled for choice but to date I have only found two recordings which do full justice to the work. Now here's a third although altogether different. . . this is a recording which not only deserves repeated listening but positively demands it. Yu reveals just what a magnificent piece of music this is; shorn of its customary sonic spectacle the brilliant craftsmanship of Saint-Sans's writing is displayed in unimpeded glory. . .In The Carnival of the animals . . . Yu opts for the version for large orchestra complete with glass harmonica (adeptly played by Alasdair Malloy) and while it is again characterized by meticulous attention to detail it is also a performance full of buoyant wit. . .

" The Gathering to me has always been an escape from the everyday music you hear. So when I heard they were releasing a B-sides and rarities collection I was more than happy. Every expectation I had they met. I'm dumbfounded as to how The Gathering can create such innovative and beautiful music yet they're still somehow overlooked. From the epic orchestrations to Anneke's jawdropping voice there's no reason that everyone shouldn't love this music. Needless to say if you liked The Gathering before you got this CD if anything you'll like them more coming out of listening to it.Disc one acts as the B-sides. A lot of B-sides have horrible sound quality but the ones on this compilation sound as if they were on a CD but were taken off at the extreme last minute. There's a polished feel but not so polished that the music feels fabricated. The live versions featured on here are astounding. If you didn't look at the back cover to know they were live you'd never guess it. Anneke's voice is gorgeous and the band is just simply amazing. How they don't miss a single beat I'll never know. The covers Dead Can Dance's In Power We Entrust The Love Advocated Slowdive's When The Sun Hits and Talk Talk's Life's What You Make It are about the best covers I've ever heard. Quite often you hear a band just desecrate the original but with The Gathering it feels like they took they're time while doing the originals justice.Disc two serves as the rarities section. From the opening track New Moon Different Day you know that The Gathering is eons better than almost any band playing music today. Anneke's vocals simply soar and will give you goosebumps that I will guarantee. It doesn't end there though each song is equally as good as the last. Even the demos have a sound quality that could rival a studio CD. The two previously unreleased instrumentals Diamond Box and Hjelmar's stand true to the ones that are released. The beauty is palpable and shows tremendous skill skill that no radio band will ever come close to. Travel from the CD How To Measure A Planet? has always been my favorite song by The Gathering. To hear the demo is really something though it sounds completely different while still sounding exactly the same. My second favorite track of their's Nighttime Birds is the same case as Travel. I do think Anneke's vocals are stronger on Nighttime Birds though.Overall my favorite songs are In Power We Entrust The Love Advocated Frail Life's What You Make It New Moon Different Day Nighttime Birds and Travel. The Gathering is a band I've always found to be one that you have to experience rather than listen to. Yes you can pick favorite songs but overall each CD they released and even this collection seem to be made to go together. Each song seems to flow into the next seamlessly. In my opinion no band does this genre more justice than The Gathering does. ",5.0
" All fans of The Gathering need to check this out especially those in the States where the majority of these songs are nearly impossible to find anywhere else. This compilation is worth buying for 'In Power We Entrust the Love Advocated' (Dead Can Dance cover) and 'When the Sun Hits' (Slowdive cover) alone; both are heartbreakingly beautiful and feature some of Anneke's finest vocals.Fans of The Gathering's albums Mandylion and Nighttime Birds will be delighted with 'Adrenaline' a very catchy song that was written because the band needed another fast simple rocking song to play at concerts.I think The Gathering's greatest album is How to Measure a Planet and it is awesome to finally hear the demos for songs like 'Travel' 'My Electricity' and 'Red is a Slow Colour.' 'Travel' especially went through a lot of transformations before its final version.This double-CD has so much to offer. There are also detailed song descriptions written by the band and several photos on the inside booklet. ",5.0
" If I could only have one selection by The Gathering this would be it. Some of the alternate versions are better than what was originally released (e.g. instrumental version of Kevin's Telescope).

" Four DVDs in the 'Thomas & Friends' series are sure to delight young viewers ages 2 and up with the exciting adventures of Thomas the Tank Engine and his transportational friends. Each affordably priced DVD features narration by celebrity George Carlin roughly 40 minutes of short stories plus another 60 minutes of bonus features such as sing-along songs DVD games and character galleries. 'A Big Day for Thomas' covers Thomas' adventure when he gets to pull his very own train for the first time; 'Trust Thomas & Other Stories' follows Thomas' discovery of a new way to cross a river; 'Percy's Ghostly Trick & Other Thomas Stories' is a spooky adventure in which Percy's mischievous trick to make Thomas believe in ghosts backfires when Percy puffs into a big pile of hay. 'Thomas & The Special Letter' sets up a conflict with George a bad-tempered steamroller convinced that roads are more important than rails. Since the many stories on each DVD are so short they can be shown to young people who have only a few spare minutes such as right before bedtime or all at once.

" First of all let me say that I love Thomas the Tank Engine. My 6-year-old son has loved Thomas for 3+ years running and I am very grateful for all the good times the three of us have had. That having been said this is a compilation VHS. You will not find any new stories on this one. However it is worth viewing (and getting if you don't have a big collection) if you have children. We got this as a gift from friends so having duplicates of the stories was not a big problem with us. Interspersed between the stories is what seems to be an advertisement for the 'Day Out With Thomas.' It is interesting to watch but is not informative for one actually thinking about participating in one of the programs.ABOUT THE STORIES",5.0
" My son has several of the Thomas DVDs and while he's just as content to watch any of them this is his favorite. The episodes with Bertie and Terrance are great. Overall a wonderful collection of earlier Thomas narrated by George Carlin. The interviews with kids are cute and provide more than just the usual shots of various engines. I find this DVD better than the 'Best of' engines ones because of the variety. Plus my son has no clear favorite and enjoys watching them all. ",5.0

" Anyone who wants to understand the movies of the Soviet Union should start with this book. It is very thorough and written in a lively bright style that is free of academic jargon.Kenez begins with the pre-Revolutionary film industry and shows how it broke down and was built back up by the Soviets. He pays equal attention to the 'high art' films that were famous in the West for decades (those of Eisenstein and Pudovkin) and the entertainment films that attracted the average Soviet citizen (such as the musical comedies of the 1930s like 'Volga-Volga.') He shows how Soviet movies responded to the imposition of Socialist Realism World War II and the cultural freeze of the late Stalin era.The only problem with this book is that it is TOO SHORT. Upon reaching the end the reader wants to see Kenez tackle the films of the Khrushchev Thaw and the Brezhnev era. However one should be thankful for what one has and in this volume one has a truly indispensible book. ",5.0

" This book was awesome. A fast paced riveting novel by an author I am coming to find just CANNOT disappoint me. I am hooked on her Carpathians and now find that I will run just as fast to the bookstore when her next gothic comes out.THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a terrific love story and mystery set in a supposedly cursed castle that has everything from grinning gargoyles to an impressive maze. The hero and heroine are just as riveting in their fascinatin for each other and then their entanglement in the mystery of THE SCARLETTI CURSE. I highly recommend this book to all readers Feehan fan or not. But be warned by the time you turn the last page of this book you will be hooked on Christine Feehan. ",5.0
" Wonderful book!

You can use any search engine to get to it. But this book really is wonderful! It can really stand on it's own! I can't wait for more from this author. The publishing company needs to publish her stuff quicker than this! Can't wait till Darius's story Dark Fire! Feel free for anyone to e-mail with any questions! I'll sell you on these books! ",5.0
" The heroine Nicoletta is the village healer. Overlord Don Giovanni exercises his right to select a village girl as his bride and chooses Nicoletta against her wishes. His home the Palazzio is a foreboding place mysterious and frightening to the villagers...a place with a history of death. Giovanni is able to communicate with Nicoletta mind to mind...the only similarity to the Dark Series Heroes...bringing a subtle sensuality to their burgeoning relationship...a welcome change from the 'pounce on each other in the first chapter' genre. Feehan continues to bring us dark heroes and independant heroines who find love in the sharing of each others gifts. ",5.0

I started to read it and in the first chapter it grabbed me and I couldn't put it down. I read it in one day (of course I got no work done) but it was well worth it. I have 5 other friends waiting for this book. You must read it. I am going to check out some of her other writings. I hope they are all that gripping. ",5.0

" I became a fan of Christine's writing through her 'Dark' series and although this ventured into different territory I was not disappointed. Christine's style and gift for writing wonderful heroes and heroines along with a fascinating story is not lost. Nicoletta is a strong compassionate courageous heroine that learns to make the best of a frightening and seemingly hopeless situation. She is forced into marriage with the mysterious Giovanni Scarletti who's reputation of darkness and danger strikes fear in the hearts of most in her village. To make matters worse once married she will be forced to live in the cursed Scarletti palazzo secretly nicknamed the 'Palazzo Della Morte' where few women who enter manage to escape with their lives. Despite her hesitation she soon discovers there is a powerful attraction between she and Giovanni and seeks to unravel the mystery surrounding her own mother's death in the castle years ago. Is Giovanni the monster her fellow villagers whispered he was or could there be much more to him than she first imagined? Giovanni is just the type of hero I enjoy like the heroine he is one that can both frighten me yet manage to touch my heart at the same time. The story kept me on the edge of my seat. For fans of the paranormal there is that aspect as well. Nicoletta is gifted with a healing power and Giovanni has the power to speak directly into your mind. Kudos to Christine for the many hours of enjoyment her novels provide! ",5.0
" Ms. Feehan has written another entertaining and engrossing book. I got very little sleep the day I sat down to read Scarletti Curse I didn't stop until I had read every page.Ms. Feehan's gothic bears her trademark paranormal touch. The hero Don Giovanni Scarletti has telepathic abilities and the heroine Nicoletta has healing abilities. While helping the Don's sick niece Nicoletta catches the eye of the Giovanni who decides that he wants her for his bride. Nicoletta is less than thrilled at that honor since both her mother and aunt were killed under suspicious circumstances while employed at Palazzo Scarletti a.k.a Palazzo della Morte (palace of death). Thus begins the tale of our fair hero and heroine. Will the Don be able to win Nicoletta`s heart? Should Nicoletta trust Giovanni? Will Nicoletta be the next victim of the Scarletti curse? What dark secret is the Scarletti family hiding? Strap up and get ready for one heck of ride as Nicoletta and Giovanni learn things that they never expected about themselves and each other.Looking forward to reading more from this author. ",5.0

" I really love The Scarletti Curse having reread it for more than 5 times I believe.The pacing is good with enough action excitement and unconditional love (a necessity to destroy the evil curse at work).The book starts with village girl Nicoletta being summoned to accompany the village 'healer' Maria Pia who raised Nicoletta since her mother's death to the Scarletti Palazzo. They keep this charade to prevent the people at the palazzo knowing about Nicoletta's extraordinary healing powers (this heritage is explained in the Carpathian book 'Dark Symphony in which the lifemate is a descendant of the main characters/couple). As Maria Pia is a midwife herself this causes no problem.At the palazzo the patients turned out to be Don Giovanni Scarletti and his niece Sofia suffering from food poisoning. While both 'healer' and assistant do their work Don Scarletti keeps observing Nicoletta asking her questions when Maria Pia fell asleep and after many dissatisfying non-answers says 'I am not so blind as you and the healer seem to think'!A few days later the 'healer' and assistant were summoned to the palazzo again but this time Nicoletta knows that no one is ill. Maria Pia therefore went back to the Palazzo with another assistant but this assistant is old and when asked about Nicoletta kept telling the Don how wonderful and extraordinary she really is. This gives Don Giovanni a reason to choose a bride at The Bridal Convent. His choice is Nicoletta who gets escorted (begging and struggling) back to the palazzo by the Don.In the following days up to and after the wedding arguments heat up a few murders commited the staff gossip while Nicoletta grows into the role of the Lady of the Palazzo. ",5.0
" What an excellent book. Great use of characters and character growth. The chracters are revealed slowly in layers. Multidimensional supporting characters. There are a pair of young girls that are so well created you can hear the russle of their gowns and the patter of their feet running down the palazzo's corridors. A mystery that grows slowly throughout the book. Wonderful sense of the time and place. I have cried 3 times while reading this book.The level of mystery and intrigue reminds me of her Ghostwalker series which has the same depth of conspiracy interwoven into the romance.This is certainly one of Christine Feehan's defining works.

" The Scarletti Curse is absolutely wonderful. Ms. Feehan once again created a lively well written work that stand far apart from her Dark series (which I also adore). With complex and dark characters this book has quite a lot of bite and more than enough romance for a true fan of Christine's work. I highly recommend this book for one and all. ",5.0
" If you're a fan of Christine Feehan you already know some of the elements you'll find in this book - beautiful courageous spirited heroine and strong intelligent handsome tortured hero. Christine Feehan has put these elements in play in such exciting ways in her Dark series that she's raised the bar incredibly for Paranormal romance. It's hard to picture anyone writing about noble vampire-like creatures in a more exciting sensuous just flat out stunning way. This book though not about the vampire-like beings in her others adds an exciting Gothic twist to Christine's writing and a clever mystery to her incredibly involving characterizations. The suspenseful ending is very exciting and the reader is not sure until the end how the book will resolve. I particularly loved Nicoletta's free-spirited naturalist perspective; her grounded innocence makes such a compelling counterpoint to Don Scarletti's cursed magnificence. I own every Christine Feehan book and recommend them ALL. This is a fitting addition to her wonderful writing. ",5.0
" I am not a romance reader but a friend recommended this book so I bought it. I loved it. It was just 'what the doctor ordered'!

He wanted her from the moment he saw her despite her efforts to disguise her beauty.

Problem with wanting to marry her is all the women his family has chosen for their brides ends up dead. But he is not going to let that stop him from getting Nicoletta.

" I have read almost all of Ms. Feehan's books but I think this has become one of my favorites. I was kind of hesitant to buy it because it wasn't part of the Dark Series and I wasn't sure I'd like it. Once I saw the price though I decided to take a chance. After reading the first chapter I knew my worries were TOTALLY unfounded. I was hooked! And to my surprise the story is about an ancestor of Antonietta Scarletti (the female lead of 'Dark Symphony'). I could NOT put it down! I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys romance novels or anyone who likes a good read. ",5.0

There was no author intrusion in any of the pages and the curse plot works really well as it turns out to be something you dont expect at all. All Feehan lovers will enjoy this as its Feehan at her best. Dont be sad that there arent any Carthapians in it the story really doesnt need any! ",5.0

" While I am not usually a fan of books where the hero is overly domineering I must concede that Christine Feehan writes so well that I enjoy her novels even though the men are so controlling and obsessive it would be frightening in real life.'The Scarletti Curse' is not a part of the Carpathian series but I found myself enjoying it as much if not more. The heroine is a healer but in a time where she could be burned at the stake should this secret gift be discovered. In order to protect herself she pretends to be a healers apprentice. Unfortunately the one man she wishes to hide this talent from Giovanni Scarletti is not fooled.Like much of Feehan's work the story is very gothic in feel and the villain(s) are truly horrible. While the hero is constantly swooping in and saving the heroine it becomes more of a joke between the two of them than a tiresome what-a-stupid-girl scenario.I was leary of this novel after being dissappointed with 'Lair of the Lion.' This novel is much much better. If you like her Carpathian series or are interested in paranormal romance this is a good book to read. ",5.0
" No female whether they are of the blood or through marriage survives THE SCARLETTI CURSE. They all violently die. One of the villagers Nicoletta knows first hand that her own mother was a victim of the curse. Still she lives life to the fullest and uses her abilities to heal people. Her guardian helps hide the secret that Nicoletta has empathic talents by fostering the idea she is just the village healer to keep her safe from Giovanni Scarletti.However the kind Nicoletta helps cure ailing lass suffering from dining on a contaminated meal with her uncle Giovanni. He immediately realizes that Nicoletta is his life mate and will protect her from his enemies but will his need to keep her safe end up making him follow the footsteps of his ancestors who loved so deep they killed for love?Though there is a political sidebar that adds suspense to the tale this gothic story line belongs to the two lead characters. Nicoletta is the classic heroine willing to do the right thing even at the cost of her own life. Giovanni is the dark brooding alpha male wanting to also do the right thing for his people and especially his beloved. Toss on top of the key theme a bit of the paranormal and readers have Christine Feehan's intrepid venture outside the Carpathian realm (see her 'Dark' series) into a totally different sub-genre that proves she is a versatile talent who deserves a wide readership.Harriet Klausner ",5.0
" The ancient dons worshipped the old gods honoring their pagan heritage and building the palazzo in defiance of the Holy Church. Two centuries ago the Scarletti family was cursed and now for years there have been rumors of murders and assignations. Indeed the palazzo itself feels evil to sensitive Nicoletta a woman who is known to be 'different' in her gifts to heal to listen to the wind to sense danger. So when the mesmerizing Don Scarletti chooses her to be his bride Nicoletta knows every bride who entered the palazzo is doomed.Nicoletta roamed the hills surrounding her village before the don's choice of her curtailed her activities to the palazzo. She had sworn no man would command her but when she fled her home to hide the don followed her luring her with his own gift. The don's darkly sensual voice erotic and seductive entices her imagination and her womanhood linking her to the man she would flee.Don Scarletti knows well the dangers that lurk upon his land. Political upheaval and family secrets threaten the woman he takes as wife as well as the others dependent upon him. He carefully guards his own gifts from others than his chosen bride. Only Nicoletta can reach through his icy aloofness to the passionate man concealed within.As a new comer to Christine Feehan's work I had very high expectations based on other reader's reactions and I am not disappointed. Written with a sensuous style a deep understanding for history and a respect for both Christianity and Paganism THE SCARLETTI CURSE contains a fast paced plot and dynamic characterizations. All the classic gothic elements keep the pages turning including the dark castle with gargoyles warnings from natural elements portents from ravens secret passageways family secrets and multiple dead wives. Further the strong heroine isn't too perfect; the troubled hero still maintains his strength amid his human failings while the gothic elements lend the perfect depth and shadow. Very highly recommended. ",5.0
" From the back of the book...Strange twisted cravings and hideous gargoyles adorned the palazzo of the great Scarletti family. But a still more fearful secret lurked within its storm-tossed turrets. For every bride who entered its forbidding walls was doomed to leave in a casket.Mystical and unfettered Nicoletta had no terror of ancient curses and no fear of marriage...until she looked into the dark mesmerizing eyes of Don Scarletti. She had sworn no man would command her had thought her gift of healing set her apart but his was the right to choose a bride from among his people. And he had chosen her.Compelled by duty drawn by desire she gave her body into his keeping and prayed the powerful tormented Don would be her heart's destiny and not her soul's demise. ",5.0
" I continue to love the work of Ms Feehan. She is a wonderful storyteller. Her books never seem to get old and tired.Giovanni and Nicolette come together to make a wonderful love story. They are both 'different' in a world were those differences could get them burned at the stake. Giovanni can read and talk to peoples minds. Nicolette has the ability to heal with her hands. They come together over a child's sick bed.Giovanni realizes that Nicolette is the women he has been dreaming about and is determine to marry her. She is his light in the darkness that seems to surround him and his family.Nicolette is a free spirit that runs around in bare feet. Raising plants for medicine and enjoying her freedom.

" Hawthorne's gentle charming collection of classic myths retold for the children of his day is a neglected classic. Addressing the reader in personable Victorian fashion his prose is clear and beautiful. Consider this sample",5.0
" Once upon a time (I was about 8) a family friend handed down his Collier's Junior Classic series to me - each volume is a glorious hodgepodge of short stories from here there and everywhere. I got to be very fond of Greek mythology especially 'The Chimaera' and 'The Miraculous Pitcher' since the Collier retellings of their respective legends were much more lively than the ordinary.Alas I forgot the name of the author of 'The Chimaera' and even that my favourite versions of the myths were all written by the same person. Some talented guy writing for the series no doubt I would have said if I'd thought about it. A couple of years ago I started browsing through an impressive-looking illustrated volume of mythology in a bookstore (which you now see before you). Whoa. 'Scarlet Letter' Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote *THESE*?His retellings of Greek myths were originally spread over 2 volumes (the other being _Tanglewood Tales_) but they can be obtained in a single volume these days. I can personally do without the gang of Tanglewood kids providing the official audience for the stories-within-a-story or the defense against critics put into the mouth of the storyteller Eustace Bright but then I want more space for more myths. ",5.0
" One day last week I could not even after hours of deliberation (the snow had made engagements scarce) decide what book to read next. I finally came upon this little volume on the end of my parent's bookshelf and decided to give it try. How could I have known what charms were in store? I felt like a little girl again and as Eustace Bright the ambitious college student who narrates these tales held his little auditors in awe my eyes too were wide with wonder. It truly is a 'wonder book' full of high fantasy thrilling action and the inimitable imagery of a master. Though geared towards 'boys and girls' Hawthorne explains in his introduction that 'children possess an unestimated sensibility to whatever is deep or high in imagination or feeling so long as it is simple . . . It is only the artificial and complex that bewilder them.' Indeed; the book hardly condescends and so will gently stretch the middle-grader's vocabulary. But readers -- or listeners -- of all ages will delight in this collection of tales for I was equally if not more entertained by the introductories and postludes to each story which relate the antics and dialogue of Eustace and the little children he entertains. These interludes also expand the stories by slipping in commentary and interpretation.Don't pass this one by; it will truly win your heart whoever you may be! ",5.0
" I ordered this book as part of a third grade curriculum for my son. These Everyman titles are really wonderful-- beautiful binding heavy pages amazing illustrations. I was not disappointed with this book. It is the kind of book we will read again and again and hopefully pass on to the next generation. Hawthorne's rendition of the myths and fables is classic and engaging and Rackham's illustrations are worth the price on their own. ",5.0
" If you've read Hawthorne's longer works you might be surprised by the storytelling fun and energy he puts into this shorter book aimed at boys and girls of all ages 8 to 80 who love a good yarn. Imagine yourself on a whispery wintery day sledding on the hillsides with friends. Or imagine yourself gathered with the kids on the front porch on a golden summery afternoon. Now add to these settings Hawthorne's inventive narrator Eustace Bright who gathers the children round on that hillside or porch and gives them the classic myths with his own unique spins.If you think you know the stories of King Midas and his golden touch of Hercules' exploits of Medusa you have here the chance to rediscover them in child-friendly yet fully adventurous form through the skills of Mr. Nathaniel Hawthorne. He gives the old tales a lot of charm makes them palatable for younger kids and weaves in lessons of ethics and morality and courage. I have always appreciated Hawthorne's more thought-provoking writings but here I find another side to the man and the writer that is magical and light. To add to the wonder I not only have the paperback version but also read this in an e-book format enjoying the beautiful drawings of Arthur Rackham.I've long been a fan of Hawthorne's short stories. While he plays out some amazing themes and characters in 'A Scarlet Letter' 'House of the Seven Gables' and even 'The Blithedale Romance' he excels in his shorter tales where the prose has less room to run off track and the themes are better addressed. He seems serious in most of his writing with only hints of his humor and playfulness but in 'A Wonder Book for Boys and Girls' we find a side of Hawthorne that's hard not to adore. ",5.0

" Impressive quality. Solid wood really nicely evenly stained wood with excellent layout clear instructions and very nicely packaged parts for assembly. A beautiful set. My daughter (almost 6yrs old) is going to be amazed when she sees it in the place where her old/antiquated art table used to be.Another selling point is the customer service at KidKraft. I noted that the overall quality and finish was really great except for one piece of the front of the hutch which was pretty good but had an imperfection that was filled in with well-colormatched well-sanded wood filler. My daughter would not have noticed it but it bothered me. I decided to call customer service an 800 number to see if they'd have any opinion on it. I figured they'd explain that wood is wood is never perfect that kind of thing is within tolerances et cetera... but before I even finished describing the issue the very kind rep (a live person who answered on the first ring - wow!) was asking me for my shipping address apologizing and stating they'd get a perfect piece out to me right away. She told me to go ahead and assemble the pieces that I had then when the new piece comes just swap it in without even dealing with sending back to them the imperfect piece. Just like that. Done. Instead of me apologizing and pleading my case SHE was apologizing and stated that she would personally make sure that I'd be satisfied.Amazing. ",5.0
" This item arrived well packed and undamaged. It looks exactly like the picture was fairly easy to assemble and is sturdy and well made. Of course it is an 'assembly required' piece of furniture but once put together it looks like a really nice quality piece. My daughter loves it. It is sized for a child and is too small for an adult. I think she'll be able to use it through age 11 or 12. It also has a convenient hole in the back of the hutch for her computer wire to poke through. I looked at this item EVERYWHERE including eBay and Amazon was the cheapest of all. The chair comes included so don't buy an extra chair separately! ",5.0

Very stable you'll love it. We have no complaints at all. Some of the information as far as heights go is a little confusing in the description. The top of the desk is just shy of 24' and the top of the hutch is just shy of 30'. As far as the chair goes the seat itself is about 14' so it is all sized quite well for your little ones. They don't have to sit on thier knees to work at their desk. You can't go wrong with this one. And you will not find a better bargian.

I ordered this one without her knowing and at first she was upset because the hutch is not that big. But once it was assembled she loves it. She is 8 and loves the little cubbies in the hutch. Everything is packaged nicely and there was not one scratch or ding or funny smells. The hardware had everything you needed (no extras) in separate baggies for the chair and desk. I put it together myself in about 1 hour. We did replace the knob with a blue glass knob from the hardware store just to make it a little more unique I guess and it looks great. With free supersaver shipping and no sales tax there is no better buy out there. Trust me I have looked! ",5.0

" I purchased this desk for my 7-year old grandson and while it wasn't the most exciting Christmas present he received it was probably one of the most practical (which is why I gave it a low score on 'fun'). It's a very nice piece of furniture and appears to be very sturdy. He loves having all his 'stuff' for school in one place and is now able to do his homework in the peace and quiet of his room. The desk appeared a little larger than we had envisioned (knowing the dimensions doesn't quite prepare you for the actual 'impact' of the item in the room) but it ended up fitting quite nicely in his room. I would say that after an average-size child reaches age nine or ten this desk would be too small. ",5.0

" When I think of Heart's 1985 self-titled album I feel it should be renamed 'Resurgence'! Meaning this was their 'comeback' album after what everyone thought they were just wilting and fading away several years earlier. It seems like when Heart was popular with 'Dreamboat Annie' ten years earlier they were on top to stay. However when the 1980s began many rock artists were forgotten and to never be heard from again. Not Heart! Sure they were lost in the early 80s because of the MTV explosion and the world was living on 'Thriller'. Capitol's bold gamble paid off",5.0
" In 1985Heart made their Capitol Records debut with their self-titled album. The band themselves debuted in 1976 on Epic. They were dropped from Epic in 1983following the release of PASSIONWORKS. Bass guitarist Mark Andes was a member of the disbanded Firefallwhose hits included JUST REMEMBER I LOVE YOU and YOU ARE THE WOMAN. Now for the songs",5.0
" This is the best Heart album ever made in my opinion. I grew up listening to Heart and I still listen to them. I saw Ann and Nancy in concert last year they were awsome as usual. My favorite song is 'These Dreams'. Another good song is 'What About Love'. Heart has had numerous #1 hits and it's amazing people still love to listen to them. ",5.0
" I liked this album since it debuted. The radio stations in Chicago played the hell out of the singles. 9 good songs. The only one I didn't care for is ' What He Don't Know'.Ann was gaining alot of weight around this time and in the video's her body is blocked by props on stage or the camera zooms in for jsut head shots of her singing. She's still got a strong powerful voice. ",5.0
" I honestly think that the first song I ever heard was either 'If Looks Could Kill' or 'What About Love'. At the time I would've only been two or three but my older brother and sister had this record. I stole it from one of them and ever since Heart has been my favorite band of all time. This album is without a doubt their best work ever. The only slight weak spot being 'Nobody Home' but it's still a good song. It just doesn't fit the album very well. Ann's voice is raw and ethereal and the way Nancy plays the guitar is too great for words. So if you love this kind of music. Then you must have this record in your collection.Also Recommended",5.0
" In late 1984 after Ann Wilson had success with Mike Reno (lead singer of Loverboy) on their duet 'Almost Paradise' for the 1984 film 'Footloose' Heart regrouped with Ann Wilson Nancy Wilson Howard Leese Mark Andes and Denny Carmassi to start recording another album. Their last two albums had flopped and they had decided to go in another direction",5.0
" This is the album that brought Heart back on top of the scene. They scored many top ten hits here and there first number one hit 'These Dreams'.

I am not a huge Heart fan so it does not bother me as much they sold out but as long as they made good music it doesn't really matter. i recommend this album as Heart's best album to date. ",5.0
" Heart was back and bigger than ever. 'Heart' was a last ditch effort to keep the band together. If it failed Heart would no longer exist. Well history shows what happened.MTV made four videos for this album and they made Nancy Wilson every teenager's dream girl. Ann was always my favorite sister and she looked real good too. MTV milked this album for all it was worth and Heart was now an official '80's band' like it or not. This album brought a breath of life into their career that seemed to be standing still.Besides the singles I always liked 'The Wolf' but 'Shell Shock' was by far the hardest loudest most rockin' tune on the whole album.

" What The Cure was to new wave/punk Heart was to rock n' roll. These songs overflowed with all the passion excitement romance and love that typical meat and potatoes male rockstars of the era felt too embarrassed to express. On this album Heart is easy listening hard rock and progressive new wave pop all at the same time. There's an excellent balance of guitar and synth with thrillingly uplifting moments and heart-melting ballads. The Wilson sister's vocals are lush throughout but what really stands out are the songs themselves.'If Looks Could Kill' is a solid dramatic rocker. 'What About Love' is a dynamic ballad that features Grace Slick on backround vocals. Howard Leese lays a fine guitar solo. The last half minute pulsates double time with unbelievable excitement and conviction. You'll continue to hear the song in your head even after you turn off your stereo. 'Never' is sexy and serious at the same time.Written by Bernie Taupin 'These Dreams' has to be among the very best ballads of the 80's. This is Heart at its most romantic and seductive. It's medieval lyrical imagery gives it a timeless appeal. The song emblazons a gorgeous fantasy world upon your emotions. It's a better four minutes than any drug could ever give you.'The Wolf' uses primal imagry to put down the unwanted advances of sleazy guys. It's guitar solo will floor you with a determined and indomitable hopefullness! 'All Eyes' scores again with an alternately sexy seductiveness and lovestruck passion. 'You don't have to say a word to get a hold of me/take me...shake me/Burning gravity baby/Look at me look at me'. What guy wouldn't love to hear those words from his girlfriend? And there's another triumphant guitar solo that's brimming with happiness. The plaintive ballad 'Nobody Home' is beautiful.'Nothin' At All' has a pure pop genius. It's got that top of the world 80's happiness to it. The guitar solo is simple yet very satisfying. The almost country 'What He Don't Know' is a decent soft rock ballad. The closer 'Shell Shock' is a bit cheesy but displays an ample pop rock sensibility.This album is very happy warm and hopefull. But unlike the shallowness of most pop music it's happy in a deep and meaningful way. When you feel like the daily grind has bled away your passion this album is the antidote. ",5.0
" If there was a recording or type of music that represents the music of my life it would be mid-'80s Heart music. This music affected me more than any other recordings I ever bought. I have never listened to a recording so many times as I did this 1985 release after buying it.It's a high-powered rock recording with power ballads mixed in. I saw a Heart arena stage show in NorfolkVA in September of 1985 and may lightning strike me dead if I am not 101% honest in saying that I have never been so stunned impressed blown away awestruck mesmerizedor captivated by anything in life like I was by Ann Wilson's lightning bolt performance and stupendously glorified stage appearance along with Heart's incredible stage energy and unmatched professionalism in the live execution of this 1985 recording.Every song on here is good. Too bad there isn't a DVD of Heart's 1985 music. Over twenty years ago this recording came out and I am still so profoundly affected by this recording & Heart's 1985 show. Ann & Nancy really struck gold recording these songs and their live `85 performance put me in a state of awe that I never felt before or after this show. I have never been thrilled like that by anything ever! Heart's 1985 recording is more than just music to me it was an unforgettable life experience that's part of me forever. This CD is a memory picture of that experience.Hopefully a Heart 1985 CD will come out that has bonus mid 1980s songs on it (like 'Love Takes Over' which is on youtube as of 2011). I still have the cassette for this recording and can attest that this cd sounds like instruments are missing or severely faded especially on 'If Looks Could Kill.' Something isn't right with the process that put this recording on a cd. ",5.0

" Heart 'Heart' #1 (1985).The airbrushed Heart on the cover of their debut album with Capitol in 1985 was quite a shock but the music is what mattered and they delivered. The album begins with the synth rocker 'If Looks Could Kill' #54 hot 100 they reached the top 10 again (after 5 years) with the power ballad 'What About Love' #10 hot 100 and #3 MSR. 'Never' #4 hot 100 and #2 MSR is a nice little pop rocker. Sister Nancy sings on the sleepy power ballad 'These Dreams' #1 hot 100 (their first #1) and #2 MSR. The 80's sounding hard rock of 'Wolf' 'All Eyes' and 'Shell Shock'. You also get the not mentioned enough 'Nobody Home'. 'Nothin' At All' #10 hot 100 and #6 MSR another fine pop-rocker. The only song that doesn't hit home was 'What He Don't Know'. They would come back two years later in 1987 with 'Bad Animals'. ",5.0

" When Heart decided to return to the fold boy did they know how to do it. Not only did the Wilson sisters look totally gorgeous (Nancy practically makes love to her guitar as she throws her legs around in the videos for this album) but they selected a series of songs which reflected the popularity of soft rockl at the time without abandoning their vocal & musical prowess. 5 million album sales later proved that Heart had returned with style while delivering both a commercial & gutsy opus. What are now rock classix These Dreams (US no.1 & UK Top 10) & What About Love (US & UK Top 10) are contained here plus the uplifting Never (US & UK Top 10). The album is consistent with some gorgeous songs such as Nobody Home & some really gutsy rockers such as If Lools Could Kill (which remains a live! favourite) & Nothin' At All (another US Top 10 hit). The only really awful track is The Wolf which tries hard to be uniques but is really dreadful. The fportunate thing is that al other 9 tracks are that good that you forgive Heart that mishap. Moreover considering the immense leap in their creative & commercial fortunes on this album the album is destined to be a classic anyway! ",5.0
" I grew up listening to Heart on the radio and now they're still one of my favorite groups and my favorite female group of all time without a doubt. This is their best album that they made in my opinion. 'These Dreams' and 'Nothin' At All' have got to be 2 of my favorite songs ever.All the other songs even the ones that weren't hits are also good. If you're a Heart fan I recommend picking this one up without a second thought. If you can find it I would also recommend getting These Dreams",5.0
" While some think 'Heart' was nothing more than pop record are just wrong! This is one of rocks finest moments! Heart rocked with this lp in 1985 and introduced them to a wider audience Four big hits! Ann & Nancy and the band picked strong material for this project and 21yrs later(wow)it still hold up! (two of the girls on american idol have done good covers of two of the songs) even the cover photo was hot! ",5.0
" After the self titled album was released Hearts' domination of female rock was thundered home. Sadly Heart went back into the studio and ruined a couple of songs changing the guitar solo entirely on 'Nothing At All' adding some overdriven guitar power chords and changing vocal parts in 'Never'. Do not buy the Original Recording version thinking you are getting the original recording either. Heart felt that the songs were too reliant on keyboards and synths after the fact went back into the studio and added more guitars and even changing vocals. ie in 'Never' Ann originally sang the part 'walk those legs right over here'. After the studio revisit it turned into a pouty kinda spoken command 'walk those legs right over here. If you search hard enough you might find an old cassette of the original recording. I don't know how to differentiate before buying so good luck. Not to be nitpicking but when you get used to hearing a certain version you don't want it changed. ",5.0

" I suffer from chronic joint pain and severe headaches. My doctor recommened that I look into a maternity body pillow similar to this product since I could use it to support my back and hips when i sleep on my side and that by using the u-shaped pillow as my only neck and head pillow ease the muscle tension that aggravated my headaches. He was so right! I purchased this product the Comfort U pillow and once I modified a bit it was perfect. it tends to be a little too long on the sides and as a result it flattens out where your legs rest on it. It is also a little underfilled. To correct that I got two elastic hair bands and turned the U upside down so it was resting on the U. I then took the ends and shook all the stuffing down each arm until I had siz to 8 inches of empty pilow case. I wrapped the hair elastics around the ends pinching the empty part shut so that the filling couldn't get back in there. When I patted the pillow down to make the stuffing even it was nice and firm no longer had a tendency to go flat. It's an easy thing to do if you want a firmer pillow.That said I recommend that you Google a different store called 'the Comfort Store' because they sell this for the same exact price but offer free shipping which will save you over $30. be aware that the Comfort U pillow comes with one white pillow case shaped to fit the pillow. You can purchase extra pillow cases for aboyt $34. I bought one in beige and I liked it much better than the white one. it matched my yellow floral bedding. They offer a blue pillow case as well (sold separately). The money you save on shipping by buying from the Comfort Store can buy you an extra pillow case!Whatever you do consider getting this if you are a side sleeper stuffing pillows behind your back and between your legs for support. Once you get used to sleepig with this pillow with your arm underneath it and your other arm over it you'll notice you awaken less during the night to turn. My only complaint and it is a minor one is that the pillow tends to reflect your body heat back to you. I am always too warm even in airconditioning so I found cooling a gel pack in the freezer for half an hour and sliding that between my forehead and the pillow solves that problem quickly. That might not even be a problem for other people. trust me if you have joint pain this pillow is the solution. ",5.0
" I have fibromyalgia restless leg syndrome and endure much pain during the night. It was totally impossible for me to get comfortable until the Comfort U Pillow was delivered to my door. I can honestly say that it truly does help me get a better night sleep in addition to decreasing the pain. This pillow has brought me many painfree nights of sleep. ",5.0
" Out of all the products I bought for my pregnancy this was by far the best. I slept comfortably throughout my 9 mos. and still use it today. The only downfall is that your bedfellow might feel neglected. ",5.0
" I originally purchased this for my pregnancy as I was using 5+ pillows for support and i was tired of chasing them as they fell off the bed all night long. I loved the support and have slept with it ever since. (i even take it with me on trips.) its great because of the refluff-able fill and because you can roll over and not have to move it. I have yet to wash it in the laundermat and see how it turns out.one con because of its size it can be difficult to fluff... do it in the morning while you have energy not at night when you're ready to go to bed.

" This is an awesome product! I was hesitant to spend so much money on a pillow but it is worth every penny!!! I have fibromyalgia & I was pregnant when my husband ordered this pillow for me. It is wonderful. I wish I would have bought it years ago. I sleep so much better now. It is great for fibromyalgia sufferers & pregnant women. ",5.0
" I am starting my fifth month of pregnancy and bought the pillow to get used to sleeping on my sides. At first I was scared of the size and concerned it might bother my husband and my little dog that sleeps next to me. I tried it and absolutely loved it.

" I looked at all the different types of body/pregnancy pillows on Amazon and finally settled on this one.

It's like sleeping in a nest it supports me beautifully and its very comfortable. ",5.0

I have been using this pillow for several weeks now and my mornings have been completely transformed! I sleep so much more comfortably and experience virtually no pain upon waking. I am 5'11' so it is not to long for me and the pillow is just the right height for my head too. I am also a cold sleeper so the body heat reflection that another reviewer noted is a plus for me!

" I have trigger point and muscle tension problems and the extra support from the comfort U pillow has helped me sleep much more comfortably. I like to sleep on my side and realized that I was holding too much tension in my back and not relaxing enough. Now I just cocoon myself into my comfort U and tuck it in along my back and I can relax more deeply. I hate to go anywhere without it even tho' it is rather big and bulky to try to take anywhere. At first I thought it was a lot to spend on a pillow but it has been worth it. Previously I had used body pillows but the comfort U gives far more coverage and I don't have to roll my a body pillow over with me each time I roll over and my comfort U hasn't gone flat like the previous body pillow tended to do. I admit it would have been nice to have when I was pregnant too but those days are long gone. ",5.0

" It is our good fortune this collection exists to showcase the tragically ignored Payne.

" Why The Boys' self-titled release isn't universally recognized as one of the essential albums that defined the 70's punk rock phenomenon will remain beyond me. Maybe they didn't fit in because they didn't conform to the punk 'look' and because they were not sponsored by the right people. They were regarded as the Beatles of punk. The funny thing is that they were actually more punk than most bands of the movement. As far as I'm concerned their first album is the best punk rock album to come out of '77 UK. The sheer energy and overall drive of the music was nearly unparalleled at the time far ahead of the Pistols and the Clash.The music here is passionate and it has attitude; it is somewhat remniscient of the Dead Boys. This is true oldschool punk rock here the dirty kind of non-political I-don't-care rock'n'roll that set the foundation for the rest of the movement. The music is loud and energetic and the songwriting is top-notch almost too good to be punk (this may have been a reason why they were cast out). The Boys take no prisoners as they churn out classic after classic song. From the all-out rebellion that is the opener Sick On You to the f***-everything attitude of I Don't Care to the amazing Living in the City (which the Sex Pistols were never quite able to outdo in terms of raw power) you'll be turning this album up louder and louder until you can't hear anything else around you but you won't even care to.There are no weak songs here. Catchy riffs and hooks are all over the place in just about every song. This isn't punk for the sake of punk this is quality rock'n'roll that also has all the elements of punk including loud vocals distorted guitars and definitely an overall feel of youth aggression. Whereas other bands were busy coloring their hair and sticking safety pins on their clothes The Boys channeled the spirit of punk into the music itself. Do yourself a favor and buy this album if you want to hear the real deal. ",5.0

" I ordered this book after visiting the Amazon and Dr. Smith's clinic.

" We met Dr. Smith when recently in the Amazon in Peru. She cured my husband's plantar fascitis with a shot of lidocaine which we feel enabled him to walk properly and thus stretch the fachitis. It cost 25cents for the lidocaine and needle and he had spent way more of that in the States with a cordisone shotMRI special night boot creams to rub on his foot etc. In any event we love this woman and have begun a correspondence with her and her foundation. Her book tells how she left a thriving practice in Wisconsin to come to the Amazon and open a clinic. She is a very special lady. Her story moves quickly and is interesting. If you ever were tempted to do good in the world this woman takes you step by step on her journey. Truth is often better than fiction. ",5.0

" This is an inspiring book that's a pleasure to read. It gives the reader the vicarious enjoyment of being part of a noble endeavor. In an age of 'road rage' and the obsessive accumulation of more and more things (which often do not make us happy) it's exhilarating to experience a taste of Dr. Linnea's life.Dr. Linnea shows us how one can give up almost all the material possessions and creature comforts of the modern world and still find meaning happiness and personal fulfillment. Dr. Linnea has created for herself a significant life. A life with much to teach a troubled world.While missionaries have long sacrificed themselves to serve God win the eternal salvation of lost souls and earn a place in the pantheon of saints Dr. Linnea does it for the pure humanity of the effort. Goodness is indeed its own reward in this Amazon outpost.Because of Dr. Linnea's 'wonderful life' many lives have been enriched and some even saved. More importantly countless hours of suffering have been alleviated. This is the most humane thing",5.0
" As the author of a book about the same region HIDDEN AMAZON I found Linnea Smith's book fascinating. From Wisconsin Linnea tells why she has gone to the Amazon (she's still there) and how she feels about the conditions the jungle and the people. Perhaps most instructive is her detailed account of the medical conditions she encounters and how she treats them under the most primitive conditions. She works lives and eats at Explorama Lodge a popular stop for trekkers in the area. This is one of the few jungle lodges with a doctor on the staff. And LA DOCTORA is one of the best books about the rain forest and its medical services. ",5.0
" I met Dr Smith last month at her new clinic while vacationing on the Amazon River. This book was especially meaningful since we were in many of the places she talks about. I can understand completely why she came to the region for a vaction but never left. Her book provides a beautiful insight into the Amazon region and it's people. The Peruvian people in the Amazon have very little by American standards but they appear to be very content and happy with the lives they lead. And she chronicles this beautifully in her book both the positive and the negative aspects of practicing with very little equipment or supplies.She provides from an outsiders perspectivethe problems with practicing medicine not knowing the language and have to go thru so much 'red tape' to get the supplies and the Peruvian medical degree needed to legally treat the people she cared about.Fortunately she has been able to develop a great support system in Wisconsin people who are able to acquire the supplies needed to built and outfit her new clinic. She is a testament to the medical profession one who practice for the love of it after falling in love with one of the most beautiful areas of the world.A fantastic diary of a doctor making a real difference in the lives of people who had only the 'medicine men' of the Amazon...

You dont run into too many albums this complete from 1st track to the last. the sparse instamentation and productioin are such the canvas for Lhasa to paint her musical/vocal paintings you hear and feel such passion fire hunger distain in her voice it pulls you in and you cant help it. a nod to her collaborator Yves Desrosiers-what a fantastic musicain on a level few others achieve- playing multiple instraments with such a deft touch and a knowledge of where there place should be in the overall mix of the songs.

When shopping for a speakers this was one of the discs I always used as a reference. ",5.0
" Lhasa's voice is simply haunting. I cannot find any other way to describe it. Her interpretation although I would say it sounds extremely personal it is so emotional that it reaches way beyond her inner sanctum into the ears of any listener. The lack of major musical arrangements allows her voice to be heard in every breath. I can only compare her to Lila Dows in terms of her delivery. This album is a must have for any serious collector of world music and if you don't have any of Lila Downs I suggest you get hers too. ",5.0

If you want to spend a very very emotional moment get the CD it's a very good investissment. Special greatings to Yves Desrosiers guitarist and arranger. One of the best ones I can swear. My life has really changed since I've heard this voice so do the same and enjoy!! ",5.0
" With the recent release of Lhasa's new album I thought I'd take a moment to say how much I've loved this one. I happened upon it in a Borders listening station. It was during the brief flash of public interest in Cuban music and I guess somebody thought it fitted the mood. Well bless them for thinking so for I otherwise would never have heard it.I was pretty well sold by the first track. I had never heard such a 'rainy' song - it is held together with the rhythm of rain and water and Lhasa's voice was instantly enrapturing like as (I think) Susan Power wrote 'liquid sorrow beaded on her vocal cords.' (She said that of Patsy Cline but the impression is the same.)Thank goodness for the bilingual liner notes - my four years of high school Spanish helped me catch the occasional phrase but these lyrics are too good to be misunderstood",5.0

I'm allways on the lookout for interesting artists being one myself and I've been involved in the music industry for a long time working in a recording studio. I can't tell you 'Buy This' because I think it is great-that's a personal opinion. But I can tell you 'Buy this' because I like it and so will you and anyone else you play it to.

" Este Cd ha sido mi sorpresa del ano 2006 Puede ser un CD de musica mejicana una obra maestra???. Si la respuesta es YES entonces La Llorona='Obra maestra'. Lhasa no tiene una voz de las que podriamos calificar de 'bonita' pero si que es carismatica y tremendamente expresiva. Si a ello anadimos que las canciones presentan unas letras originales con sentido y mensaje unos ritmos que se meten en tu sangre y te acompanan alla adonde vayas unos arreglos musicales 'teatrales' en el mejor sentido del termino y unos instrumentos musicales irreprochablemente bien tocados el resultado dificilmente puede mejorarse. No tengo ni idea si Lhasa esta arriba o abajo en el raking de las cantantes superventas. Pero si es lo primero....es logicoy si es lo segundo...esperemos que tarde o temprano LHASA se haga justicia con tu forma de enteder la musica. ",5.0

" I recently heard this tape being played in a shop abroad and immediately enquired what it was and ordered it from Amazon the moment I returned home.

" Growing up on the border in South Texas and traveling through much of Mexico over the yeras this recording brought back a lot of memories through De Sela's Rachera style.

One of my all time favorite CDs!!! ",5.0
" I can't get enough of this woman's music! I shout More MoreMore! ",5.0
" After reading all the rave reviews for the past few years I decided to break down and get this CD. The art cover closed the deal. I was even more impressed to find out she did it. Where to begin describing something so unique and different? There is only one Lhasa de Sala there is no mold so they'll be no copies. The only voices I've heard that remind me of hers are Linda Ronstandt on her excursions into Espanol and Edith Piaf. Listen to the opening track 'De Cara a la Pared' as she hauntingly invites you into her own cabaret joining in as though her voice is a violin softly seductively enticing the listener entry into her world. The comparisons to the two above mentioned artists stop there and really do no justice to her brand of music created with Yves Desprosiers. This is really a collaboration as Desprosiers pens many of the songs with her and plays no less than eight instruments! He also is the producer. Of course the focus is the voice of Lhasa but the guitar and acordian work Desporsiers lend to the CD give it the sidewalk cafe sound. It is not just her vocals and the beautiful arrangements but the cutting lyrics that stand on their strength alone. Although the songs are all entirely in Spanish a non-Spanish speaker can understand the songs because the booklet is bilingual. To say that Lhasa's songs lament would be an understatement the pain comes out in her voice even if you don't understand Spanish. There is a mysterious quality to the songs a spiritual quality music from deep within her soul La Llorona cries out. I like to say which songs I particularly like but all the songs are strong and stand out with individual characteristics. If I had to pick one song it would be 'Los Peces' because of it's theme The Virgin Mary and the simple poetic lyrics she so eloquently demonstrates. The CD is a triumph for a first effort and will probably be hard to match. Although considering the talent and her last words in her acknowledgments 'Viva La Evolucion' she probably will make another stunning piece of music. If you like Gypsyesque-Spanish music tinged with folkloric Argentinian and Mexican melodies soulful interplay into categories undefined but refreshingly fresh this is a CD for you. I suspect Lhasa has much more to say and those that heard this CD will be waiting for her sophmore effort. I should have bought it long ago. ",5.0
" Some of Lhasa's songs on 'La Llorona' sound like they could have come from a Parisian (or Montreal) bistro as easily as from Mexico. Some songs feature accordion and klezmer. Lhasa de Sela is a Mexican-American who lived in Montreal until recently. She grew up travelling across Mexico and the United States in a schoolbus.'La Llorona' (the Wailing Woman) is the name of a legendary Mexican woman who threw her children into the river in her anger and jealousy. The villagers found her dead as well the next morning and her ghost continued to roam the earth wailing for her lost children. That title is appropriate enough for this splendid unexpected collection of songs (only three are not original).Lhasa's voice is haunting much like the mythical wail of 'La Llorona.' There is an urgency and passion in her singing. My favourite song has to be 'De cara a la pared' a haunting waltz with unusual sound effects (rain splashing musical saw). I heard Lhasa for the first time on the Canadian TV series Due South which actually introduced me to a host of lesser-known Canadian talent. I fell in love with the songs and rushed out to buy 'La Llorona.'This is my absolute favourite Spanish-language CD in my collection. It is mysterious uplifting joyful and energetic like Mexico itself. If you're looking for something uniquely Mexican in flavour something mysterious passionate and soulful or simply a change from the ordinary look no further than Lhasa de Sela's 'La Llorona.' ",5.0
" I heard Lhasa de Sela last June in San Francisco at the Lilith Festival. Although I myself am a struggling musician with my own CD's to sell I was enthusiastic enough to want to buy several copies of La Llorona. Unfortunately it wasn't availabe in the US and over the past several months I had searched for a copy to no avail. I was given the CD last week and have listened to it non-stop since.Lhasa and her band are obviously deeply steeped in the traditional music of Mexico Argentina Spain and Central Europe. But she has an authentic and original voice that is able to transform those influences into something truly original and transcendent. When you hear her voice and melodies you know she speaks the truth. She sings like a woman of passion who has no place in her life for cynicism or boredom.Luckily she has a band that knows exactly how to support her vision. The music balances on a strange edge between the haunted loneliness of flamenco and and the topsy-terviness of a small-time circus band.I will be buying several copies of this CD. ",5.0
" I've been listening to Lhasa De Sela all summer in the bistro where I wash dishes. Every time it plays Life seems to become more poignant. I can feel the clients en-Joying their food just that much more we are all trance-ported to the rythmns of this exotic and hauntingly beautiful music.I finally borrowed it to make a tape for myself. I was surprised to realise the singing is in Spanish. The music is just that international that the actual language is of the Heart!I have one critisism",5.0
" This is a masterpiece. Lhasa has a unique and powerful voice - flexible sexy and captivating. So subtle in its beauty it will make you tremble. And the laments will crush your heart.

" It's such a shame how relatively unknown this series is. Granted it does not appeal to everyone as it is a very subtle and quiet series. The genre is historical romance set in Victorian England.

However I only wish they dubbed it as well...I would've loved to hear it in English since the story is set in England after all. ",5.0
" This second set of Emma begins with a textbook example of how to do a recap episode as Vivian's reading of Romeo and Juliet prompts Hakim to coyly recount to the audience what's happened so far in the grand fashion of a Shakespearean prologue. As it ends with him proclaiming that the 'Second Act' is about to begin we're off with the continuing story of Emma and William.As it begins Mrs. Stowner's sad but natural passing has left Hakim - who isn't going to be in England forever - as the only remaining champion of Emma and William's relationship. Emma is fortunately not out on the streets as she's quickly employed by mischievous unconventional German expatriate Dorothea Molders - the woman she met at the train station at the end of the last set - who turns out to be a wonderful employer. Meanwhile to Hakim's disappointment and dismay William proposes to Eleanor in an attempt to please his father and forget Emma.Of course this is a romance so an outrageous coincidence throws Emma and William together again and William realizes his terrible mistake. But by that time Emma has started spending time with Mrs. Molders' gruff but kind handyman Hans with whom she has alot in common - and if William humiliates Eleanor and the Campbell family by breaking the engagement at a late stage it might ruin his father's business his brothers' employment prospects and his sisters' marriage prospects all in one shot in addition to profoundly hurting Eleanor who he doesn't love but considers a friend...Can William convince Emma that they can defy convention as well as convince his family that she is worth the financial downsizing they might all face if he leaves Eleanor for Emma?The answer is no surprise pretty much given away in the new opening sequence and by the fact that Hakim's one-episode prologue is delivered in a fairly light tone in spite of the Romeo and Juliet springboard. It's the execution of the story that's so wonderful. The new cast members are engaging and the scenery of the Molders' country estate expands the Victorian world largely limited to the stunning depiction of London in the first set.Ultimately Emma ranks at the highest level of slice of life anime and is a must for the collection of any fans of that subgenre - as well as period piece fans or even anyone who simply wants a change from the action/adventure genre of most anime.

" Emma season 2 was a surprise. It felt much more grand than its subdued classy first season.In season 2 of Emma our main character moves away from London to get away from the struggle of her affair with a noble and begins life as a maid in Germany where her first day is met with an accusation of theft. Things lead to an emotional but very happy ending and Emma finds herself a favorite among the maids and the masters of the house. Emma's love Will back in London can not get her out of his mind and falls into depression but finds comfort in Miss Campbell a sweet noble girl. The two begin to fall in love. Things seem to go smoothly until Emma and Will's lives cross paths again and the story takes a dramatic turn.Nozomi's release comes with perfect subtitles and a great set of extras. It's a quality release.I can't recommend Emma enough for anyone who loves a good story. ",5.0
" In Season Two we see Emma and William living apart in two households which when you come down to it are both upper crust but have different views on class money power and their places in the universe. As one review pointed out this is a very subtle and quiet anime and many people may not enjoy it or even watch it because it just isn't their thing. Like the first DVD set this one has a extra in the form of a book with few extras within the DVDs themselves. It is also like the first DVDs subtitled. It WOULD have been nice to hear English voices but I don't mind that much. On the other hand would have been nice to hear the German accent of the Molders maybe?Like the first series the plot is realistic and the characters very solid very aware of their place. They are characters of their time and don't pretend to have 21st Century values in a 19th Century world. And I still want to kick William in the butt - he is such a good character that he REALLY generates a emotional response from me. Mostly the need to smack him around.And the character of Monica felt off. The Campbell family came off as so proper and aware of their image...yet they allow the oldest girl to dress and act like that?!?!? Funny thing is I was starting to feel sorry for the Campbell family till...well that be spoilers. I guess the Japanese needed a villain for the piece. I think it would have been better off if they left out the Bad Guy and let the lovers have to deal with the real problem - deciding if their love was important enough to break away from their class their culture and their society. Would they be strong enough to believe in themselves? Sad to say we will never really know. The ending was not as realistic as I would have hoped and did leave some loose ends. True it suggests happy endings for all but we all know that there would be a LOT of fallout from such a ending.Enjoy with good English Black Tea (from India) and scones (from Scotland) and try to give the Maid the day off while you watch the DVDs.

" Emma is working in a new household with a team of other maids and servants. Certainly something she's not used to. William is seeing Eleanor Campbell. It's obvious both sides want marriage between them except for Eleanors father. You'll see why when you watch it. No matter how much William told his father he loved Emma in part one he's totally against him being with her. He wants William to marry into title to secure their place in the gentry.Eleanor is foolishly head-over-heels in love with William even though William has admitted that he just doesn't want to be lonely and likes her company. There is a scene that will floor you about how desperate Eleanor is. She is so naive! I love the blast from the past which tells how Williams father and mother met.William thinks he'll never see Emma again and Emma is accepting living without him and being a maid. Eleanor's older sister tells William off and gives William an ultimatum. William proposes and Eleanor the silly girl says yes. Hakim leaves England. It's not until Emmas new employer visits her friend 'Mrs. Trollope' aka Williams mother that things get more interesting. Emma nearly ruins her chances to go to London again with her employer but when she does go she is to accompany Mrs. Trollope to a party. They dress her up and sure enough she looks like a true blue blood and all eyes are on her.Of course William and Emma meet each other at the party where she learns that he is engaged. My favorite part of the movie! I also love the support from her new employer. She stands back yet encourages the match. From William breaking the engagement Viscount Campbells revenge Emma considering Hans a fellow worker Prince Hakims return to Williams unwavering devotion to Emma as well as his family it ends with the woman who started it all. Perfect! I wish there were more movies like this. ",5.0
" Most western animation for children is to put it simply really wretched. At best it's tolerable.But a shining exception would be the tale of the Avatar of all four elements and to restore the balance in the world. The first two volumes of 'Avatar The Last Airbender ' serve as a solid start to the series -- they smoothly introduce the characters and sets up some nice story arcs without skimping on development of either.South Pole Water Tribe siblings Katara and Sokka stumble across a glowing iceberg with a young Airbender boy named Aang (and his flying bison) inside. All Airbenders were killed long ago. You guessed it (and so does Katara)",5.0

" After purchasing and watching this movie I can see why there is such a cult following. The movie was obviously made with very little budget but the quality blew me away. The movie follows a town that gets taken over by vampires. They attack innocent people and drink lots of blood. The similarities to other vampire movies stops there however. The acting in this movie is non-existent but the action explods off the screen. The gore and death scenes are great and I was shocked (Thats real blood people). Chainsaw weilding maniacs and ghouls of the night.This movie took WAY too long in production but the special features and movie transfer are WELL worth the wait.Great (Dare I say 'B') vampire genre film.Keep in mind this IS very low budget-so if you're expecting 'Blade' you will be dissapointed.

" This is an excellent two disk set filled with tons of extras. The film is a gore soaked saga pitting a group of young people against an ever growing vampire hoard. Filled with tons of bloody spurting gooey deaths it should be a delight for gore-hounds. The film moves at a nice fast pace and is never boring. Where the DVD really shines is in the extras. Multiple commentary tracks are included with the cast and crew. This commentary illustrates the love these people share for the film as well as being very insightful on the makings of low budget renegade cinema. Also included is an original cut of the film that is also worth watching to see how 'Darkenss' morphed over the years into the current version. We are also given a nice set of interviews with many of the cast as they look back on their experiences making the film. All I can say is this movie is a lot of fun-check it out. ",5.0

" I usually buy the salted version of this butter since I mostly use it for spreading and for that I like the flavor of the salted version better. That being said there are a number of recipies that call for unsalted butter and then the unsalted Lurpak is as good as you will find.Note that Lurpak is cultured butter (not sweet cream butter like most American brands) and as such it has a deep and rich flavor that no simple sweet cream butter can match. Cultured butter of this kind is produced by fermenting the cream with lactic bacteria that convert sugars to lactic acid before churning the cream into butter.In my opinion the Lurpak Danish butter holds its own in comparison with far more expensive butters. I actually prefer Lurpak over brands like Echire etc. ",5.0

" The front man for bands like Not drowning waving and My friend The Chocolate Cake has released what I consider the best CD I have heard in years. There are too many great songs on this CD to name a standout track. (Not one 'skipper') Gentle piano soundscapes over a wash of atmospheric sounds and Bridie's unique vocal arrangements make this the best CD of its kind since David Sylvian's 'Secrets of the beehive' in 1987. This is a must have for anyone that enjoys fragile but moving music. It amazes me that this CD and this artist will never get the recognition in the USA he deserves. Thanks Australia! ",5.0
" The album 'Act of Free Choice' is a superbly crafted series of songs incorporating orchestral arrangements piano balladry electronica and David Bridie's own husky lyrics. The net effect is sublime with many thoughtful ruminations on traditional Australian life and also the people of Irian Jaya whose struggle for independence from Indonesia is one of Bridie's most public causes.This album is quite unlike a typical rock or pop work and it totally eschews the hackneyed and over-produced musical fare that typically dominiates our airwaves and album charts. The songs have a lyrical atmosphere that combines both melancholy and quiet joy - particular highlights for me are 'Dive' 'Kerosene' and 'Deserters'.Although this album was released around 4 years ago (in 2000) it seems to reveal more every time it is played. It gained quite an amount of radio airplay at the time of its release (largely on the independent stations) and is widely regarded in Australia as one of the best new releases of the past few years.For American and other non-Australian listeners who want to gain a sense of the best of contemporary Australian music ignore Kylie Minogue and her ilk - try this album instead. Also definitely worth a listen is Bridie's more recent release 'Hotel Radio'. - Pallando Sydney Australia ",5.0
" Australian Rock looks to be in good shape right now with the likes of David Bridie and Powderfinger flying the flag with excellent recent albums. It's evident on first listen that Bridie's 'Act of Free Choice' sounds like nothing else out there at once urgent graceful and haunting you can expect these 11 songs to take over your mind and senses for a good while to come. The sparse beats and subtle atmospherics may find an influence in Massive Attack yet Bridie goes one further marrying these tracks to lovely unfolding melodies. Nowhere is this more evident than on 'Dive' which just envelops you in it's sheer beauty 'Kerosene' too has this power. Even the more minamilist songs have a hypnotic pull with Bridie tackling social/political as well as personal themes. It's one thing to enjoy an album another to come away from it feeling transformed and somewhat beholden from the experience. It may not be widely heard ...yet but this is essential listening. ",5.0

" SOREN AABYE KIERKEGAARD (1813-1855) 'stepped' into history as the master in managing the weapon of irony. As a young student he was fascinated by SOCRATES and the German romantic thinkers and writers. This is one of the 4 most important works of him. Some Kierkegaard lovers even call it his magnus opum. In fact this rather early work (1841) is a dissertation which in particular addresses Socratic irony (and the German romantics). The irony was to him a protest against bourgeoisie and a strong weapon against the speculative philosophy from Rene DESCARTES (1596-1650) - Kierkegaard was the first person to demask the lie of Descartes i.e. his 'cogito ergo sum' 'I think therefore I am' - up until Wilhelm Friedrich HEGEL (1770-1831).

" When this album was cut in 1956 participants Kenny Burrell Pepper Adams Tommy Flanagan and Paul Chambers were all young modern jazz players just making names for themselves on the scene; it wouldn't be long before all were considered stars. All four of them were from Detroit - thus the title(only house drummer Kenny Clarke didn't qualify in this regard). It's a very relaxed date with just about all the tunes assuming a medium groove. John Lewis's attractive AFTERNOON IN PARIS gets an excellent treatment with Flanagan's piano solo being especially fine. Tommy is also brilliant on Kenny's original blues TOM'S THUMB a tune that reverses the order of things a bit by starting out with Burrell and baritone saxist Pepper Adams exchanging 4s at the beginning rather than at the end of the tune. YOUR HOST another Burrell original is perhaps the most relaxed tune on the date with everyone producing quiet yet swinging jazz; Kenny Clarke's brushwork is particularly delicate and delightful. This is a solid mainstream-modern jazz album from the mid-50s - definitely worth looking into. ",5.0

" Listen up folks if you want to add to your music library. I know a little bit about good music but of course that's just my opinion.If any of you our there are fans of classic 70's kind of music this is a CD that is obscure but you shouldn't pass up. I looked for this album for nearly 10 years and finally found it about a year ago. It is now safely tucked away in my safety deposit box. That's how good it is to me.If you like artists like Gino Vanelli or Steely Dan you need to check this out. Roger has an absolutely stellar voice and the musicianship (sp?) on this CD are simply fantastic. These guys who the heck ever they are are fantastic musicians.My favorite tune is well you don't really care about that but trust me please try this album you won't be disappointed.Great voice fantastic lyrics touching melodies. I can't say enough good things about this album that I thought was lost to me forever. I wish he were still recording!A '10' (well '5' to Amazon) if ever there was one. ",5.0
" There is no doubt that Anthony Callea has one of the best voices of all time. This DVD was recorded after his first album was released. It has a great variety of songs including his big hits like 'The Prayer' 'Per Sempre' 'Bridge over Troubled Water' and 'Rain.' I think my favorite might be 'Wanna Be the One' which is infectious and upbeat.Though this wouldn't play on my old DVD player I had no problem playing it on my computer. Besides the concert there are five videos a making of and a behind the scenes. All in all it's one of my favorite concert DVDs ever. Now I hope my dream comes true and he duets with Leona Lewis someday. ",5.0
" This may be a 'crib' but it is possible to learn a great deal from it. It is not only about the two plays but also contains a short biography of Sartre and summaries and analyses of his major works the novel 'Nausea' and his major philosophical work 'Being and Nothingness'.It also contains a summary of the essay on 'Existensialism' one of his most influential works.It does not however as it was published in 1983 contain the latest revelations about Sartre's life and work. At the time it was written my sense is Sartre's reputation was more unimpeached than it is today. This guide stresses how much of a 'humanist' Sartre was  and how he always focused on the human situation and how deeply his writing is involved in the social problems of mankind.But Sartre's gung- ho Communist Anarchism is seen by many today as less than commendable. And his personal life shown to be far more contemptible and exploitative than was previously thought.In any case this work which rightly see Sartre more as writer than philosopher provides an excellent introduction to his overall accomplishment.

When I heard this story for the first time I had no idea his life had been so difficult growing up. To see what the Lord did for this broken lost little boy is a magnificent testimony to His colossal love for us. Greg has been tested on the anvil of adversity and his story has profoundly affected my life and faith. As powerful as his ministry was before it is even more so now.

" This drawing textbook is a great deal. It has over 200 art lessons and meets the high school fine arts requirement. For the price you can't get a better deal. ",5.0
" I love to draw and have done so most of my life and yet have known so many who say 'I can't even draw a straight line'. I have found this book to be a great and simple manual to teach out of. I have personally known both adults and children who found the artist within from using the Drawing Textbook. This book gave me a way to explain some concepts simply that I didn't have the words for. To be able to do but not be able to understand HOW has been the chasm around drawing101. This book is your bridge over that chasm. It is great to teach out of but I doubt a child would want to pick up this book on his or her own to learn out of that isn't talented to begin with. The feel of it seems more mature than that.For those who can draw well this book was not made for you. It was made for beginners and those who look at drawing as something 'talented' people do. It is made for teachers like me who need words to describe things they know how to do. If you fall into one of those categories I really do not think you'll be disappointed. ",5.0

This course is part of our basic curriculum. ",5.0
" The author argues that everyone can learn to draw in a way that enables him to express his ideas in pictures just as he can learn to express ideas in words through writing. It takes no special talent and only a very tiny minority will be unable to acquire this skill.Conventional art education says that art is used solely to 'express yourself' without ever learning the basis of art - drawing. This is as silly (and frustrating and ultimately discouraging) as giving a child a violin and telling him to express himself through music. We can be taught the fundamentals of drawing just as we can be taught the fundamentals of music and while most of us will never achieve mastery or beauty we can at least achieve proficiency and have a new lifelong skill. This simple inexpensive text delivers on its promises!My 5th grade daughter and I have used this text and now can communicate readily via pictures for art math engineering (me) structural design etc. I've used these skills to renovate my master bathroom!

" David Remnick's 'King of the World' is one of my favorite books and it encouraged me to take on this meaty Pulitzer Prize winner. Remnick was on the ground as The Washington Post's Moscow bureau chief and in this work he strings together all of his exhaustive reporting for a compelling account of the collapse of the Soviet Empire.If you're running a mock U.N. at your school I'd rate 'Lenin's Tomb' as mandatory reading. ",5.0
" Reading David Remnick's unmatched work chronicalling the demise of the USSR may well have been responsible for my decision to major in Soviet History. As a professional student of the Soviet Union if I could recommend only one book on the USSR of the dozens that I have now read this would easily be me choice. It is as informative for the novice as it is challenging for the expert. If you have even the slightest interest in the demise of a world superpower and the twentieth century's most influential - and murderous - ideology you simply must read this book. ",5.0
" Despite the book's Pulitzer Prize I'm a little ambivalent about saying this in one of the best books I have read. For sure some of the best parts are that Remnick seemingly has open access to all the major Soviet political players while he was there. And he doesn't even brag about it. The titans of Soviet politics seem to be open to all who want to speak with them though Remnick's day job as the Moscow correspondent for the Washington Post certainly helped...a large part of his life in Russia then that he totally did not to write about.It's fun to follow him track down figures and weasel his way to get access to whoever he wants to talk with. He clearly is excited to be there during the transition and is personally invested in the story as he speaks Russian and both his parents and his parents-in-laws have Russian ancestry. On the other hand the book is a rag tag contemporaneous collection of personal reporting and interests lacking to some degree the broad overview that only comes with the passage of time.Doubtlessly you get the feeling of what it was like living in the Soviet Union during the Gorbachev years and the transition to Yeltsin and the end of the Communist Party....with the addition of having Remnick magically inserting himself in front of whoever he wants to talk with to fill you in on the inside story.Enjoy it.

" Remnick writes eloquently and grippingly. He amazes the reader with one heartbreaking vignette after another. It seems amazing that though while only spending a few years in Russia he seemingly met everybody who was anybody and traveled to the remotest parts of the dying empire.Remnick does not try hard unfortunately to maintain objectivity. He deifies much of the intellectual dissident movement even repeatedly callling Andrei Sakharov a 'saint.' Remnick turns Gorbachev into nothing more than a well-meaning Pandora responsible for and unable to control the breakup of the Soviet Union.Remnick does show what I believe to be responsible for the breakup of the USSR- namely the rot corruption and inefficiency endemic in the Soviet system- but he seemingly relegates it to symptomatic and not primary status. The empire would have inevitably broken up with or without Perestroika and Glasnost. The book should rank despite its flaws among the best books of contemporary history ever written-doing for Russia what Democracy in America did for the US. ",5.0
" Remnick masterfully kills the Republican/Conservative myth that Ronald Reagan 'a triumph of the embalmer's art' in Gore Vidal's words led the demise of the Soviet communist empire through buying ever too many useless weapons. By showing the implosion of a very cruel very corrupt poorly managed state there can no longer be doubt about the reason for the demise of Lenin's dream. It's interesting to note that since capitalistic democracy has been introduced in Russia living standards have actually dropped (in large part because of corruption and cronyism). I definitely want to read Remnick's follow-up Resurrection to learn more about this. ",5.0
" David Remnick reported on site for the WASHINGTON POST during the Soviet Union's last days. He interviewed many persons from society's bottom to society's top from homeless derelict to Mikhail Gorbachev. That and his readable prose help explain how he won the Pulitzer. Of course it also helped that he was against totalitarianism and for humanity.When I read history I prefer a firm grip on the date. Overall this story does flow in chronological order from 1988 to 1992 or to 1994 if you get the most recent edition with its afterword. But the story jumps backward occasionally when Remnick tells the history of a character and at other moments I was vague on the date. I think chapters should have been subheaded with dates and more spots within chapters should have stated the date.Nevertheless do not let my preceding quibble deter you. I think this book is already something of a classic and I'll be darned if I'm going to give it anything less than five stars. Does another book do as well as what this book does which is put you into the scene of the collapse of the vast Soviet empire?I would have advised Mr. Remnick to include a double-paged map of the U.S.S.R. and a glossary of names events and institutions. We do get source notes bibliography index a list of interviews and twenty-two pages of relevant photos.The Vintage trade-paperback edition is over five hundred pages in small font. So be ready for something to settle back with. It will be worth a portion of the limited time you have in life. The story and the people are phenomenal and they will expand your existential horizon.

" A stupendous chronicling of history in the making! We are presented with several differing viewpoints on the collapse of the Soviet regime and its splintering in these truly tumultuous years. As the author points out whereas other empires like England took decades to recede and change - this took place within a few years. Within days sometimes overwhelming transitions took place.The efficacy of this book is the internal focus on the people in the country itself; there is none of this hyperbole on how Ronald Reagan solely dismantled the evil empire! The book is about the Soviet Union - there is little on the break-away of the Eastern Bloc countries like Poland or East Germany. Mr. Remnick presents us with a wide array of people across this vast land - from various dissidents to various neo-Stalinists. We experience their anguish as the grim and brutal history of their country becomes revealed as once secret archives are exposed.This book is well-written engaging and sprinkled with some wry humour. If you are interested in this epoch it is a truly marvellous and first-hand account. ",5.0
" The book is a compilation of short stories (each chapter a dozen pages or so) about the author's first-hand experiences in the Gorbachev's Soviet Union. From Baltic to Sakhalin and from coal miners to Gorbachev himself from Stalin to Yeltsin and from Solzhenitsyn to Sakharov the book paints the picture of the monolith's fall. This colorful collage describing the critical period in Russian history combined with keen commentary creates for the reader the distinct flavor of the time.For Russia it was the age of confusion and disillusionment. Gorbachev's half-hearted reforms (the interest in truth ended where the Party interests were concerned the pursuit of democracy gave way to the pursuit of the runaway republics etc.) were matched by the half-hearted '91 coup (no real plan no propaganda with the military Lenin wouldn't have approved).For generations Russian people did not know much of the sad history of their country and less still about the life in the West. The blissful ignorance was one thing that helped them in their miserable existence. Their various degrees of belief in the grand ideals were the other. With glasnost Gorbachev aimed at opening the gates of truth while preserving the faith. In all honesty it was impossible",5.0
" Remnick's frank insightful analysis of the Soviet Union's final days filled me with inspiration and sadness. I'm inspired by the inhuman perseverance of the Russian and Soviet bloc people and saddened by the intense and lethal persecution of millions at the hands of their so-called leaders. Remnick shows a society led by decades of fear - citizens who feared persecution and leaders who feared the loss of power. The author flows easily from dissecting the Communist party and power brokers of Soviet society to eating cabbage with Siberian miners who don't expect to live past 35 to intense discussions with the Russian intelligentsia who fought the system quietly and desperately. It is a long book and at times I found myself needing a Russian history reference guide. But Remnick is not writing a history filled with facts and statistics. It is all about the people. Lenin's Tomb should be read by any journalist who feels the urge to go beyond 8 graphs. Truly wonderful. ",5.0
" It's hard to imagine there was any dissention from the Pulitzer committee over 'Lenin's Tomb'. This book excellently combines top-notch journalism and fine precise descriptive writing for an increbidly enjoyable and informative read. Considering how most such 'good for you' books are long slogs about as exciting as bran 'Lenin's Tomb' was a surprising pleasure.I came to this book with minimal knowledge of Russia in general let alone the Soviet transition and disliking what I had encountered of Russia's culture and people. 'Lenin's Tomb' manages to explain the basics to ignorant laypeople like myself without condescending or dragging through too much history. What you need to understand what was happening Remnick provides no more and no less.'Lenin's Tomb' proved an eye opener about the Soviet experience but it also reflects on the larger ramifications of Communist autocracy. So many of the explorations of the Soviet erosion of society and culture gave me a sense of Deja Vu compared with China only China has perhaps been less scathed by the shorter span of its bureaucratic red terror. Also while 'Lenin's Tomb' did not make me like Russia or Russians any more it did present the context of how and why people can be a certain way so that I now hold it against them less.'Lenin's Tomb' is almost novelesque in its readability a page-turner and easily beach or plane fare. I doff my hat to Remnick's ability to carve dense political stuff into an involving compelling narrative. Perhaps Russia scholars would find points to criticize but from a journalistic perspective 'Lenin's Tomb' is the book all of us wish we could write. ",5.0
" Mr. Remnick has given us a masterwork. He seamlessly meshes intimate portraits of Soviet citizens within the larger landscape of the last days of the Soviet Empire. He has a rare ability to blend the micro and the macro in a soul-stirring narrative. This is a profound work that is filled with compelling stories. Lenin's Tomb is so superb that even those who avoid 'history books' will relish it. Could not more highly recommend this book. The scads of glowing reviews below are all well deserved. ",5.0
" In the Pulizer-Prize winner Lenin's Tomb David Remnick offers the reader a trip through history that is at once frightening and enthralling. Beginning with the horrors orchestrated by Lenin and continuing through the rise of Yeltsin to power Remnick intertwines political and social history with first-hand accounts which he gathered during his time in Russia during the 80s. The result is a work of unparalleled genius taking hard facts and presenting them in a personal way that makes the reader feel as if he is actually experiencing them. The end result is a chilling dose of reality for those who have idealistic notions of the world in which we live. I highly recommend this work in which Remnick portrays the brutal realities of socialist life as well as the inevitable downfall of such a system. ",5.0
" Now that we are a decade removed from the fall of the Soviet Empire it is a wonderful to look back and read a fabulous primary source about the events. Remnick the Moscow correspondant for The Washington Post during the late 80's and early 90's (and since the editor of the New Yorker which was a well deserved honor for a fabulous journalist if I may say so myself) was right on the scene when the incredible collapse of Communism took place. He interviewed hundreds if not thousands of people who had lived through the Soviet regime and who played some role regarldless of how small and seemingly insignificant in the transformation of the nation and this research paid huge dividends. He combines all these personal stories into one great book that explains and analyzes why and how this happened. It is very well written and while being comprehensive remains comprehensible. It is a wonderful book and anyone who is interested in Russia (or would like to become so) likes history in general or enjoys good semi-academic writing this book is for you. ",5.0
" Lenin's Tomb is an autopsy of sorts performed by one present during the last death throes of the Soviet Union.

" Lenin's Tomb by David Remnick chronicles the point at which the rot at the center of the Soviet system became more powerful than the Communist Party's iron fist. Remnick is a storyteller telling the story of a riveting period in history. As he writes 'To live anywhere between Bonn and Moscow in 1989 was to be witness to a year-long polical fantasy. You had the feeling you could run into history on the way to the bank or the seashore.' Lucky for us Remnick spent 1989 (as well as the years before and after) in Moscow. ",5.0

" David Remnick has given us two things",5.0
" Remnick's book is easily the most graphic and accurate account in English of the Gorbachev years between 1985 and 1991. It is unlikely to be surpassed. I judge his accuracy from his account of the August 1991 putsch which is excellent given the information that was available. As the renegade agent that triggered the June 'constitutional coup' KGB Chief Kryuchkov's August 6th decision to draft coup documents AND the August 14th decision to again start drafting the documents I have referred to Remnick in my research on the coup and the events that lead up to it. Suffice it to say that Kryuchkov's final decision on August 14th was triggered by the Bulgarian President who fired the two KGB appointees at the head of his intelligence service at my instigation. I had disclosed to him some intelligence secrets that compromised both the KGB and the British MI6 and proved that his intelligence chiefs were communist puppets which was hardly surprising since Presidents Bush and Gorbachev had agreed to leave Bulgaria in the Soviet sphere of interest at Malta in June 1989. Like a lot of people in Bulgaria I disagreed with that decision. One of the best ways of judging the accuracy of a book like Remnick's is to see how the information given in the book dovetails with the secret stuff and his book does so nicely. ",5.0
" A great fresco of the dramatic death of the communist URSS. The author lived as a correspondant in moscow for many years during the final years of the cold war and describes the tragic living conditions of the common people the corrupt style of living of the burocrats the disgusting privileges of the elites. An enclosed empire founded on corruption lies violence and misery where the dream of a better life for the masses promised by the communist leaders in the decades only became a rotten shell of deception and misery. The author interviewed hundreds of people of any social class from the miners in the urals to Mr. Gorbachev from Yeltsin to the moscow houseviwes including scientists artists poets smart people confined to the edges of the empire because of their open mindedness and acumen. This book is another important tragic witness of a wrecked dream a tale told by hundreds of different voices that all tell thesame story of treachery and indecency corruption and stupidity. A great history book that I highly recommend and that clearly helps us to understand why now Urss is governed like an authocracy by an ex kgb officer. Great book. ",5.0

" Environmental protection programs in the United States have greatly improved the water quality in lakes rivers wetlands coastal waters and ground water during the past 25 years yet many challenges remain. Dr. Robert Reimold-an internationally recognized expert in wetlands ecology and active participant in the Water Environment Federation (WEF) a worldwide non-profit technical and educational organization-has written and edited a significant volume on integrated environmental management. Developed for environmental engineers planners and managers; government policymakers; economic planners; and other key stakeholders Watershed Management builds on the correct premise that many water quality and ecosystem issues are best addressed environmentally financially socially and administratively at the watershed level rather than at the individual waterbody or specific discharger level. The watershed approach addresses environmental issues within natural hydrologically defined geographic areas taking into consideration both surface and ground water flow. Important within the watershed approach is the cumulative impact of a wide variety of human activities and the prioritization of critical issues within a given watershed. Dr. Reimold points to work in the Chesapeake Bay and the Florida Everglades as two good examples of decisions being made and focused integrated actions being taken on a 'whole drainage system' basis rather than by controlling point sources of pollution only. Water Management spans case studies in the U.S. France the Nile River basin the Pacific rim and former Soviet Union. The book contains a foreword by Dr. Eugene P. Odum. Dr. Odum professor emeritus at the University of Georgia is a recipient of the Crafoord Prize-an equivalent of the Nobel Prize-for excellence in ecology from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. It is well-annotated subject-indexed and authenticated quantitatively. Robert S. Frey M.A. Editor/Publisher BRIDGES",5.0

" I loved this book- as a neopagan it gave me insight into how much of Wicca and in turn neopaganism developed. I realize it does only focus on Wicca itself and that there were several other movements contributing to the rise of Neopaganism but the book's title states the topic so no reader should be expecting much else! On the flip side because they helped contribute Freemasons Aleister Crowley and others are covered even though they themselves were not Wiccan. Overall excellent book well-written and a must-read for any and all people even interested in Neopaganism Wicca or modern witchcraft! ",5.0

" I love the realistic damage and the crazy ways you can race in this game. The only downside is it's difficult to race multiple opponents without getting knocked off the track as is most race games where the AI is pretty aggressive.

I've even run over my driver with my own car which I've never done in any racing game before. ",5.0

You forget you have anything on your feet. They have a very cushiony sole which feels delicious to walk on - kind of airy. I'm going on a trip in October and I'm definitely taking them even though the cooler weather is here. The jewelry in the design held up beautifully - nothing fell out or came apart or needed fixing. I ordered them in a size 11 so that's a lot of shoe. The straps across the top are secured toward the back of the shoe which all but completely removes that flip flop sound. They stay on the feet are quiet and are good even in the rain because of the non-skid sole. This has been my favorite thong ever and I will definitely be ordering more from White Mtn. and Amazon!

" I love this thermometer. Don't get me wrong it is definitely an expensive purchase. However the money was well spent. My husband and I went through a considerable amount of trouble in regards to our children and trying to determine if they were truly having fevers. For a period of about 6 months our kids were having fevers ranging from a low grade to a true textbook definition of having a fever. Well we were under the impression that they were. We have made several trips to the doctor's office even switching pediatricians a few times in order to try to figure out what was going on. We were using an Exergen thermometer (which our doctor's office used)that continuously showed higher temperatures. Now I'm not knocking the thermometer in fact it's helped us during other incidents of true fevers. But based on what our pediatricians kept saying the only way to get an accurate temperature reading is with a rectal temp. Now the basic rectal thermometers that can be purchased at local pharmacies/walmart/target/etc never work for us. This Welch Allyn thermometer is accurate and considerable fast considering how long it takes to get rectal temps. So for parents who have been having difficulty finding an accurate reading of your child's temperature save yourself the stress and purchase something that will definitely match up to your standards. It's expensive but will save you money in the long run. ",5.0
" Item is exactly what I wanted and expected. I decided after purchasing several other Probe Ear and Temple Thermometers and them not work properly as well as not being accurate it was time to spend the money and use exactly what they use at the Dr.'s office.

" My health condition requires frequent monitoring of my temperature. The inexpensive thermometers were inconsistent and replacement batteries were hard to find. The Sure Temp Plus 690 costs more but is very accurate easy to use and AA batteries can be purchased anywhere. I feel confident in the readings. A back lit display would be nice but is not essential. It probably would run down the batteries faster. I would recommend the item to anyone needing fast and accurate temp readings. ",5.0

" We were left with flexible spending money at the end of the year and thus decided to make the plunge and purchase this. This thermometer is expensive but worth it.

I'm very satisfied with it so far. ",5.0
" Very sturdy. Holds up well and performs accurately for long periods even in the context of high humidity and difficult conditions in a developing world hospital. ",5.0
" I got one of these for our office. This model is a big step up from the previous model (679) that it replaced. The 679 has only 1 button from which to access all functions. The 690 has 3 buttons so you can quickly access the function that you want. It appears to be durable & accurate. Highly recommended. ",5.0
" I love having this thermometer. We have three kids and one is an infant.I got rid of my pile of cheap thermometers! I don't have to second guess the reading like I did with the cheap ones. If you have an infant you will need a rectal probe. I ended up buying that and switch them out depending on which kid we need to check. It's easy to switch out and I recommend spending the money to have that peace of mind. ",5.0

I consulted with a health practitioner who recommended the Welch Allyn Suretemp Plus 690. It works. It gives consistent temperature readings.

It is still working perfectly and we would recommend this thermometer to anyone who really needs to take temperatures often. It is so reliable. This one gets 5 stars!!!!! ",5.0
" This thermometer is great. We went through a number of less-expensive thermometers before finally finding this one. As a parent of a young child it's really important to be able to quickly and accurately take a temperature. After an unexpected hospital stay we noticed the really awesome thermometers used by the hospital staff. While this model is not quite the one from the hospital it is the exact model used by our pediatrician. We can always count on it to be fast and accurate!If you have any money left over in your annual healthcare savings account I recommend spending the money on one of these! ",5.0
" My wife has some health issues and needs to monitor her temperature regularly. We have gone through all of the cheap digital thermometers we could find I finally got sick of having the variance in readings(some were off by as much as .5 degrees!) I decided to find the best one I could get. this is it. the same one found in hospitals and doctor's offices the 690 is accurate fast and reliable. It also has a history which makes reporting to your doctor if you need to easy to do. if you only need to take your temp once in a while don't bother with this but if you even have to take it weekly I would say this is the only one to consider. make sure you get extra probe covers and replace the battery regularly but otherwise using the model could not be faster or easier.

" In rich and poetic prose Kincaid powerfully describes the life story of Xuela a woman with an alienated and barren soul who cannot love and does not want to be loved yet surprisingly is very sensual. Kincaid points to the role of motherly love and the bond to the homeland in forming the individual personality and consequently one's flow of life.My quote",5.0
" I think more readers should read this in context of Jamaica Kincaid's own personal life especially regarding her torn relationship with her mother. It would then become extremely touching as Kincaid really writes this to save her own living. While other reviewers have found this book to be harsh or dirty in some sense we should gain the sense that this narrator is really at a loss for love that there is so little to love but was able to find love in herself. ",5.0
" If you understand the culture of the Caribbean then you will certainly understand and enjoy this book. As I read it I remembered all the intresting characters from my childhood that resembled the characters in The Autobiography of My Mother. Jamica Kincaid's style is so richly descriptive it takes you 'home' again. Xuela is a very strong female character and although fate has made many of her choices for her she ultimately takes control of her own destiny. A very good read as are all her other works. ",5.0
" Autobiography of My Mother is a powerful mesmerizing and other-worldy tale of Xuela a woman of Dominica West Indies who is a worthy subject for Kincaid's musical cadences and rapturous prose. Boy can this woman write - and she infuses all her prose with the lilting voices of her compatriots. There's no way to read her work aloud without finding yourself lapsing into the patois sing-songy style of speech that comes thru so clearly in her writing. This book is a painful tale the recounting of a difficult life without much love shown to the girl as she grows from motherless infant to strong and bitter young woman who aborts her pregnancy and remains defiant the rest of her life. Raised motherless herself she determines never to mother others. Taken on a metaphorical level the woman's story could be the story of Dominica torn by suffering racism power and the unbreakable bonds that bind them together.Powerful writing on so so many levels. ",5.0
" Although her story may not leave one with a warm feeling for Dominica just reading this book made me ache for the places in her story and I see every inch of the road the mountain the sea like it was in front me. She weaves it all together into sad life and yet how can you not long to see Giraudel and Mahaut Trois Piton and all deep green of that mystical place. I read it over and over and over. ",5.0
" Jamaica Kincaid's most recent book The Autobiography of My Mother is a poetically rendered account of a woman's journey through loss longing hope and strength. Kincaid's writing here is imagistic and human so that the reader can enter the character's life. The work questions our distinctions between poetry and prose fiction and autobiography the personal and the political. This book is a sensual and intellectual pleasure ",5.0
" Wonderful book! This book synthesizes the experiences of a young woman growing up on a Carribean Island. It provides a point of view into a world few people experience or understand",5.0
" This amazing novel succeeds at its ambitious and worthy goal which in my view is to show with precision - intellectual emotional visual auditory olfactory - the sinister mechanism and the devastating results of maternal abandonment. Kincaid's narrator suffers a grievous loss and the circumstances of her life reinforce and magnify that loss. No one has ever protected her and she hangs onto life by a thread. Though amidst 'family' she is truly alone in the world. Franz Kafka wrote that one should only read novels that hurt because those are the works that raise consciousness. This straightforward and skillful novel is replete with imagery of anger sadness and layers of detail that provoke utter despair in the reader - and that's just Kincaid's point. Kafka would have approved of this gripping story. ",5.0
" I think this is the general consensus from the reviews gathered here but I will add my voice to the chorus so to speak. This book is haunting. This is not one of those books that you forget about as soon as you've finished reading the last page. I've personally never been to the Caribbean and I do not think I will ever be able to personally visit Rousseau for instance but Kincaid's literary ability to make the descriptions jump off the page is something to be admired. there is a caveat to all of this of course. This book is not for the faint of heart. There are portions of this novel that are quite graphic and that is putting it lightly. That is not to say that it distracts from the work itself merely that it is there and certain sensitive readers may take affront to it. This is a rich text that can withstand multiple readings because you find something new every time. I came to this novel after reading. In a previous work ' A Small Place' and gratefully on my part the author was redeemed in my esteem. Not that I'm someone of any great import but I had completely sworn off the author as someone I could never enjoy. this book is really hard to describe beyond the utter basics to someone who has never read it. in order to do so I would need to commit a great disservice to the book and the author. There are elements of biography and autobiography as well as magic realism and what could possibly be construed as a cultural critique of the West. It is not necessary to see each and every one of these threads to enjoy the book I merely use this as a way to comment that the author certainly has an intellectual project in mind.of course this review is not an introduction to English. sufficed to say this book is worth your time.

" Those familiar with the dearly departed Miracle Legion (poster boys for the 'Should Have Been A Household Name Foundation') and the under-rated Upstate New York Americana-rockers Subduing Mara will find this little release to be a pleasant surprise. Sparse intimate and demo-ish (in the best of all possible ways) Mara frontman Peter Hutchison and the Legion's legendary Mr. Ray have combined efforts to create a casual and intimate folk-rock gem. Difficult to catagorize this short-but-sweet offering is reminiscent of everything from David Gray to Supertramp to 'Me & Mr. Ray' era Miracle Legion. Although the disc credits Hutchison with the songwriting Mr. Ray's Legion-flavored 6-string sonic stamp is readily apparent throughout. Despite the fact that it's a far from perfect disc ('Promise' for instance sounds like an exercise in 'we better put a pop song somewhere on this thing') 'exquisite corpse' has a distinctly unique character and is both beatific and quirky in turn. Unfortunately for Lucas Shine this record defies being shoved into any convenient little boxes for the sake of marketing. Fortunately for the rest of us however there are people still out there making this kind of music... hopefully we'll hear more from these folks down the line. ",5.0
" This disc contains Ornette Coleman's pioneering 37-minute 'Free Jazz' PLUS 40 minutes of shorter pieces recorded in the same year. So for a little less money than the American release of 'Free Jazz' you get about twice as much music and the title track is the final piece a fitting climax to a great set of music. That said the jazz on this disc may be more challenging than some listeners would like but among the extended collective improvisations of the sixties besides being the first this one is more immediately accessible because it SWINGS and it COOKS! And you can tell the musicians are actively listening to each other and responding to each other's work not just showing off or venting their emotions. So in a nutshell 'Free Jazz' is less cosmic than Sun Ra's 'Magic City' less cerebral than Cecil Taylor and less primal than Coltrane's 'Ascension' but probably more likely to hook you into an intensely brilliant musical world.

" This book is a paradox. It is written in a casual conversational style yet it contains very scholarly information. Ostensibly aimed at a young adult or even younger audience it appeals just as well to adults. The main text runs about 105 pages with an appendix. It gives detailed information on the arms armor and fighting style of the Germanic peoples that overran the Roman empire in Western Europe from around 400-800 A.D. It is the little details that really appealed to me such as how the sword hilts were constructed different makers marks on blades and centers of manufacture. The excellent illustrations by the author compliment the text nicely as well. The author ended this study around 800 A.D. because that is when new metalworking technology changed the types of swords being made thus beginning a new era in weaponry and swords in particular. I will definitely be reading more books by this author. ",5.0

" I started taking Vitex after reading about it on many fertility sites. My husband and I have been trying to conceive for over 6 months and are trying everything to make it happen before he deploys. I have always had irregular periods- even my first one was. I had been on birth control mainly to regulate my periods before meeting my husband and then afterwards to prevent pregnancy. I was having two periods a month or one every 45 days- just all over the map. Since coming off of birth control 7 months ago my cycles would vary in length between 25 and 35 days. It was driving me crazy having to wonder for weeks at a time if I was just 'late' again or if I was pregnant. Then when the cycles were shorter my luetal phase was not long enough to carry out implantation thsu preventing pregnancy. So I ordered Vitex. I have had a regular 27 day cycle for four months now. I can even pinpoint the exact day I will start my period which has NEVER happened. I will be taking this from now on instead of birth control (after a pregnancy- hopefully!) to regulate my cycles. I highly reccomend it. ",5.0
" I have been reading about vitex for a year or so. I tried using another brand of vitex and I would feel very weird (dizzy light-headed super heavy flow)...I guess it was because the levels of vitex varied with each capsule....so I was never able to get the correct dosage. So after reading the reviews for the Solaray Vitex I decided to give it one more shot. I highly recommend THIS brand of Vitex because the ingredients are standardized...meaning you are guaranteed get the same potency with every capsule.I have been seeing my doctor for two years now to correct my infertility problems. He told me that I was not able to ovulate on my own. I would have to take drugs. I wanted to try a more natural way first. Last month I wasn't taking vitex....and I did not ovulate. This month i am pleased to say that I have a positive on my ovulation stick! I was so happy that I took a picture of it to show my doctor!! It is definitely working for me.

On a side note about two years ago I bought some Vitex for PMS and it didn't seem to work. Later I found out from reading that it's the Vitex Extract that is supposed to be more effective for these feminine problems and what I had purchased before was just Vitex Fruit. I'm not sure whether or not the Solaray Vitex Extract I'm taking now is helping my PMS crabbiness but I think it is helping with my bloating. ",5.0

" I spent a lot of time researching natural remedies to help with fertility. My husband and I had been trying for 2 years and no success. I am 36 years old with no children and it started getting frustrating. I had 100% normal periods 28 days exactly every month. I had read some reviews that said do not take Vitex if you have normal periods. I also get migraines. BAD migraines usually the exact day before my period.Because of this economy my husband moved out of state to look for work and so we have been seperated for the past 9 months. We timed out visits with eachother around ovulation. Still no luck. In May 2010 I started taking vitex. My first period happened as normal as usual but this time no migraine! In July I planned a visit up north to visit my husband. Upon returning to Florida I discovered I was pregnant! This after 2 months of taking Vitex!SO I am a believer in this! I'm sure there may have been other factors involved the food is much fresher and healthier up north and we were just haning out having a good time no stress. If nothing else if you get hormone related migraines I would try Vitex. I have had migraines for many years so bad I have been in the hospital for them and I have a high pain threshold! Still have a long way to go and I am considered 'high risk' because of my age but an thrilled with Vitex! Highly recommended even with regular periods. ",5.0
" This works! It is AMAZING! It helps your body to produce progesterone. You don't need to take progesterone if you take this. It made a huge difference with my emotional symptoms before my period. I am like a new person! And it helped with spotting that I was having from not having enough progesterone. I didn't have to take the risky progesterone my doctor wanted me to take- I cured myself with this. Make sure that you take the Vitex that is the extract with .5% Agnuside (this one). Don't take the one that is just Chaste Tree fruit. It does nothing and it's a shame that they make it because people might try it and think that Vitex doesn't work. I want every woman who is suffering needlessly to discover Vitex because it helped me SO much! ",5.0

" I have always had a normal menstral cycle until about a year ago when I stopped getting my period.

I read in a book that Chaste Berry Extract could make that possible. It said it could take a few months but I thought I would give it a try. I have been taking it (one pill a day) for months now and for the first few months the change was minimal but I could tell a little bit of a difference. Now it seems to be working it is a lot more regulated than it was. I've only had to take the Provera one time during the first few months of taking this extract. Hopefully soon I won't need the Provera at all! I will continue to take this product for a long while. If you are having the same problem as me I STRONGLY recommend this!

" This is the most awesome product ever! I used to have regular periods till I hit my late 20's then my system started going crazy. I'd miss a period then get one the following month. Then I went for 3 months without...hence a trip to the dr and left with a prescription for Provera. I started researching Provera and only found bad stuff about it being synthetic... my search lead me to Vitex and since its natural I thought it's worth a try. I took one pill a day and the following month my period was right on schedule...and each month since!! I think it works wonderfully.Before writing this review I read the others and noticed one lady writing about the decreased migraines. I used to suffer from migraines at least once a week and they were bad & horrible. Bad enough to make a trip to the ER sometimes as I was sure something much more was wrong...they were that intense! I noticed in the last past few months that I've had less migraines and they were less intense some that I could skip taking a pill. Upon reading the other ladies reviews I'm now confident it was Vitex regularing out the hormones that were causing the migraines. I too found that I'm less irritable and moody.I want to call Vitex the magic 'lady fix'. ",5.0
" When I found this product for my daughter she was 20 years old and just diagnosed with PCOS. She had moderate beard growth very overweight and extremely painful periods. After having a CAT scan done that diagnosed PCOS (they found cysts on her ovaries) and a blood test that showed an extremely high testosterone level (way above the normal range) I was quite alarmed when the doctor told us that he wanted to put her on Yaz birth control pills and spironolactone a potassium-sparing diuretic (it acts as an anti-androgen but then you have to monitor your potassium intake). I didn't want my daughter on these powerful drugs that both can have dangerous side effects (strokes for Yaz cancer for spironolactone). So I decided to research a natural supplement that she could try first before resorting to the prescription medications. I found Vitex Chaste Berry Extract and I started giving my daughter two capsules per day. There have been no side effects from taking this product. My daughter went back to the endocrinologist 6 months later for another blood test. I admitted to the doctor that my daughter had not taken the meds he had prescribed - that we had tried her on Vitex for the past 6 months. I promised him that if the blood test showed no improvement in her testosterone level we would start her on the meds. Lo and behold when the results of the blood test came back my daughter's testosterone level was reduced to one-half of the previous level--and it is back in the middle of the normal range!! I was thrilled! This is a great product and I highly recommend it for lowering testosterone levels in a female. ",5.0

" From the charming opening sequence of memories from Rosemary and L. Sprague de Camp to the interesting list of Heinlein's 'Unwritten Works' this volume provides a fascinating insider's look at Robert Heinlein's life and work.It purports to cover every one of Heinlein's published works ... short stories novellas and novels all ... and I believe that claim. If it is missing anything I would be unable to name it. The book generally assumes that the reader is a Heinlein fan and has read all or most of his work. You won't find much in the way of plot summaries here. What you will find is information about various drafts of novels where information is available and for these it is interesting to see how an original concept was molded into published form.There are some notes and tidbits about every work often including information about Heinlein's inspiration for the work as a whole or for elements used here and there in the story. Other pieces of trivia are liberally mixed in.Oddly the author makes a number of mistakes when trying to enumerate various plot ideas. For example when listing Heinlein works which use time travel as a device he forgets 'Farnham's Freehold'. In listing books that use the surface of Venus as a location he forgets 'Space Cadets.' However I can forgive these oversights. If nothing else it gives the reader a chance to 'participate' by knowing that you remember something about Heinlein's work that this researcher overlooked or forgot. ;-)If you haven't read at least most of Heinlein's novels and many of his short works then this book probably isn't for you. You'd be completely lost in not knowing the context of the discussion for most of the works. Without an abiding love of Heinlein's fiction much of this could be deadly dry.For someone like me who literally grew up reading Heinlein (I read 'The Star Beast' during the first month of 4th grade when I was nine years old and I'm pretty sure that was the first sci-fi I'd ever read) this book is a treasure and I wish I had happened across it long ago. I don't agree with every conclusion drawn by the author but there are many things about Heinlein's writing that even two die hard fans will disagree about.If you haven't read a lot of Heinlein the information in this book is not of the type to often inform you or inspire you to read particular Heinlein works. For folks like me who have devoured his every word often many times each page contains interesting information.Highly recommended for every Heinlein fan. ",5.0

Instead of a dramatic presentation it's a deep exploration of choices and alternatives and risks that such a mission would face.

" The amazon.com reviewer hits it right on the nose regarding this set. Stravinsky was not a conductor at the start of his career but began to conduct his own works in public in the 1920s when he was in his mid-forties doubtless in part because he needed the income. Some of his earliest recordings are not entirely successful (at least in my opinion) but by the time he made the ones in this set in the early 1950s he was truly expert in getting his players to produce what he had in mind as much as any composer/conductor I can think of. Sometimes his recordings feature studio or pickup groups that are not quite on par with the top orchestras but they often are and his performances are always well worth hearing.Amazon's reviewer mentions the splendid Histoire and Octet. Stravinsky did stereo versions in 1961 though the stereo Histoire features Los Angeles musicians including violinist Israel Baker rather than the New York-based musicians in this 1954 version which includes violinist Alexander Schneider. All of these are excellent but the Histoire and Octet here in excellent mono sound get my vote as more dramatic and exciting overall.The original LP of the Histoire and Octet is a rare collector's item (the excellent notes to this set by Tim Page actually mention this) and the CD sound is superior to that of the original LPs so it's great to see this set at a low price again. Grab it quickly before only the expensive ones are left. ",5.0

" Having gotten tired of passing by my bathroom only to hear the vent fan roaring away from having been on no telling how long I looked around and found this simple one-to-one swap for my existing switch. Design-wise it is a spring loaded timer that can be set for anywhere from about 2 to 15 minutes. Setting it causes the fan to come on and then the timer simply winds down to cut the fan off after the set amount of time. The unit comes in either white or beige (which for some reason costs more on Amazon). The installation package includes screws for the power connection screws for the switch plate a plastic knob and a small plastic plate with timer markings and retainer nut. The timer plate is flanged to fit a traditional switch plate and is sized to fit into a decora styled plate. By the same token the unit has screw points for either style. In my estimation the thought that went into the design makes this a 5-star product. Obviously it does require an electrical installation and if you don't have the confidence to replace a wall switch by all means call an electrician or a more confident friend to do the work.If you are doing the install here's some info that might be useful. The unit's connection points are clearly marked as 'line' (for the input power 'hot' wire) and 'load' (for the appliance it is being connected to in my case a fan). It's usually pretty easy to determine which cable is bringing power into the junction box and normally the black wire for the cable is hot (that being said it's always best to check using a volt meter between what you think is hot and the ground wire - you obviously should drop power to the box before proceeding to installation). The timer may work if hooked up in reverse but I assume there is a reason the manufacturer has designated which connection is to be hot. The connection mechanism uses a screw with an integrated wire clamp to hold an inserted wire easy to do if you have plenty of wire to work with. In my case I didn't have long enough wires in the junction box to make this kind of connection so I first attached a pig tail wire to each connection point. For the actual install I attached each pig tail to the line and load wires in the junction box using wire nuts. Just a thought but that may well be an easier approach even if you have plenty of wire to work with. ",5.0

I was hoping that there was a more attractive alternative and the FD15MWC switch was exactly what I was looking for. So I replaced the old FF15MC with a FD15MWC and my new timer switch fits in beautifully with the two adjacent light switches and has performed flawlessly.

" Firstly let me tell you that if you are an elite critic and watched this movie ask yourself why. Do you even like the action-movie genre? No? Then don't waste our time by writing reviews about stuff you don't enjoy. We like it here and we like Hollywood. So astalavistababy.For all WWE Fans and those who have come to see John Cena blow things up by more than just his fist - this is an awesome action flick. I too came to see this movie because I am a fan of WWF now known as WWE and because I admire John Cena as a person and not just as what we see him do inside the squared ring.The first 5 to 10 minutes of the movie needs to be passed over. To be forgiven. It is not the best start to an action movie. And this is an out and out thriller of an action movie. But then Robert Patrick shows up and everything rocks and everything is cool again. Yes I came to see Cena and got bowled over by Robert Patrick. Patrick carries this movie. I would say he saved the movie. Cena is great. He is our hero. And we cheer for him throughout the movie as he gets beat while trying to rescue his dear wife. But you can't help fall for Robert Patrick. He waltzes in all bad-a$$ and mean. He is ultra uber-cool. He makes the badguy role come alive and give meaning to the whole story. As in any story for the hero to be a hero you need a strong adversary. We get that in the form of a team of criminals led by Robert Patrick.The action is non-stop. As soon as the villain has done his first job in the movie - the action keeps up the tempo and we get big gunfights and bigger explosions. The crazy black dude routine is well played here by a henchman of Patrick. I was a bit disappointed with the truth behind the 'rock candy story' - they should have made it as big as it sounded. But there is plenty of more fun in the movie. Some dark humour and Cena is incredible as he chases down the bad guys in the mandatory car chase sequence and then on in the swamps. This is thrilling from there till the very end. Some good hand-to-hand fights. Cena gets punished and he triumphs. The deviation with the 2 other crooks in the same swamp thinking Cena is a cop looking for them is also brilliant turn of events. More action. More a$$-kicking. The scenes with the explosion are very well shot.The two big ones with Cena at the petrol pump explosion and him at the shack in the swamp exploding are incredibly well captured. You could feel Cena getting the fury of the fire. Awesome stuff. And Patrick is unstoppable too. He is determined and he has the wife as a leverage and hostage. There is the essential bad girl accompanying the villain Patrick. She does a great job better I think than the actress who plays Cena's wife. In all I would rate high the casting as the team of Patrick is well picked bunch of actors doing what they do best. These bad guys are worth cheering for.Cena of course makes it to the climax. An epic one it is involving a truck a motorboat explosions fistfights splattering of blood and the suspense of whether Cena's wife will survive this ordeal or not.Watch this one and make sure you reload the popcorn.

" The Marine DVDIt's interesting to see Vince McMahan and the WWE going into another form of 'scripted entertainment' i.e. diversifying. Smart business move.This is in fact a terrific action/adventure movie in the mold of the Rambo or Schwarzenegger films (e.g. 'Commando') or the Indiana Jones series. The violence is not accurate in depiction of results but neither is it in any movie where female stars takes full-power strikes and come bouncing back. If reality counted in the movies there would be no girl-star action movies.The violence is actually toned down in favor of action. For example Sgt. Triton chooses to takes out two very tough villains in exciting brawls when he has a good fighting knife with him. Reality would have been different .... and much bloodier. Not much gore or blood in this picture however and you can safely take your pre-teen or teen son. Or yourself. My wife liked it too for that matter.Don't be surprised to see the knife on the market soon ala Rambo.The acting was top-drawer within the context of the plot. I never heard of John Cenaso I can't be considered biased. Triton was seen first in front of his commanding officer then interacting with his wife. He was supposed to be emotionally restrained with his commander and strong but a little reflective with his wife. He was. Then The Marine had a mission. He had to complete it not emote and burst into tears. After the adrenalin high wore off he'd probably start shaking but while things were going on he didn't have time to be upset. Man haven't the sweetie-boys who have panned his acting ever been in a fight? I never heard of the starbut he turned in a very believable good performance for the part. The excellent-looking wife did a fine job as well. No nudity in this movie. Unfortunately.In sum a fine example of its type and highly recommended for all. It requires some suspension of belief but most action movies do.Recommended for fans of John Cena the WWE and Arnold and Rambo for that matter.GunnerGunner December 2007 ",5.0
" The Marine is quite a phenomenal action film! The amounts of insanely addicting and devastating-looking action scenes are overwhelming. The film stars WWE wrestler John Cena in search of his wife who was kidnapped by a bunch of guys who weren't afraid to die or kill anyone who unfortunately happened to get in their way.Anyone who enjoys action films with lots of hand fighting and lots of shooting (and I mean LOTS of these things) you will definitely find yourself enjoying the Marine. It's nothing but total nonstop action for the last hour or so. The movie clocks in at 1 hour and 23 minutes (even though some other places have said the time length was a bit longer it's actually not). The negative reviews are really strange to me- John Cena himself promoted the movie as nothing but an action film. It doesn't pretend to be anything else. It's just lots and lots of ACTION!My favorite moments were the exploding gas station and the bad guys shooting Cena's car WHILE it was flipping around in the air! These are truly some of the greatest action scenes a movie could ask for. Anything better than this would be impossible! ",5.0

" O.K. The basic plot -- cop forced by vengeful ex-con through a series of timed challenges -- isn't unique . But the story has unexpected twists and turns and uses the city of New Orleans to its advantage. John Cena does a great job and I would be willing to watch any of the other actors again. The story is violent -- explosions are the threat the movie begins with -- and there are maybe two mild profanities in the general release version. But if you snack while you watch your movies beware. Get the snacks beforehand because you can't miss a minute of this fast paced thriller. ",5.0
" I thought this movie was incredibly entertaining and filled to the brim with action suspense explosions and comedy. John Cena stars as a Marine named John Triton who is being honorably discharged for disobeying a direct order. When he returns home he decides to go on vacation with his wife Kate. While at a gas station Kate is kidnapped by a jewel thief named Rome and his associates. John goes on a 1-man rampage in order to get her back. Throughout the day Rome and his group try to kill John but he's too stubborn to die. If you love action I highly recommend THE MARINE!!! ",5.0

" This is undoubtedly the best cure for a boring sunday afternoon. Our hero (John Cena ) is poised to pick up the mantle of America's next Hero / Champion. The man can take a full force blast to to his cranium with Thor's Hammer and resucitate after a minute; feeling invigorated enough to resume his Crusade. The wunnerful Robert Patrick (Terminator II) is his challenging nemisis and does not dissapoint.Now THE ACTION sequences of this movie is what is worth the price of admission. From frame one the pyrotechnics/asskicking is WHIZ BANG. The dialogue provides some fine comedic relief ' MAN BROTHERS JUST DON'T DRIVE MINI-VANS YA DIG? ' (the pimp).Cars disintergrate bombs blow bullets buzz fires blaze no time to bleed complete the mission! This BLU-RAY izda bomb! Grandson pass the popcorn. ",5.0
" 'The Marine' was pretty much a bomb when it was released in 2006; fans and critics alike hated the movie but if you have a fondness for action films and if you are a huge fan of wrestler John Cena purchase the DVD. I bought the movie purely because I like looking at Cena not because I think he can act. There is a lot of male testosterone available but both the script and performances are flawed. The plot deals with a marine who discovers his wife has been kidnapped by an evil demented villin and it's up to this marine to track down his wife's captor and make him pay. TV's 'Nip/Tuck's' Kelly Carlson plays the wife and Robert Patrick is an OK villin but it's Cena'a perfomance and presence that make the film. I am sure with the write script Cena could be a huge movie star; he has amazing screen presence with the looks and body that most actors would die for.The DVD comes with many bonuses including both the theatrical and unrated versions the featurette called 'The Making of The Marine' WWE Promotional Features John Cena Featurettes and more.

" This movie was the debut of wrestler John Cena. He is the many timedheavyweight champion of the WWE. He has proven to be entertaining as a wrestler. In this movie he saves the lives of some fellow marines in Iraq from some al-Quaidi terrorists. He is discharged for disobeying orders.He and his lovely wife Kate whos is played by Kelly Carlson decide totake a trip into the mountains. On their trip they drive into an altercation involving some dangerous jewel theives. His wife Kate is snatched and taken hostage. These jewel theives are led by a viciousvillain played by Robert Patrick. He truly comes off as being evil. Thiskidnapping results in some nonstop action. Triton gets involved in high speed chases and many hand to hand situations. Triton even encounters crooked policemen. There are even explosions all during the chase scenes.Cena and John Patrick have a battle to the death to end the movie. Thereis also an exciting rescue scene. All in all this was a very entertaining movie. ",5.0

I don't see the differance is between the unrated version and the rated version but it still a great action experience.I think John Cena should stick to being an action star besides wresling because fans would want to see him in future actions movies as a tough man.

" I first read 'Create a Life....' about a year ago at a time when I had been phased out of a job I thought I loved my mother died and a friend was suffering from depression. I was angry stressed and burnt out. As a sort of one year anniversary gift to myself I have just re-read the book. It is concise. The writing is clear and crisp and the ideas are beautifully supported with everyday examples. Among the most meaningful tidbits for me are the three words 'You are enough.' For most of my life the more I accomplished the harder I pushed. I was rewarded with bonuses and kudos and still felt the need to compete. Finally I gave myself permission to get off the merry go round and pursue other interests. And as Zoglio advises I let go of anger and resentment and began to take care of myself. I now choose what I do. I have time for volunteering and time for me. This is a book of simple truths... if you want love and abundance in your life give it away. If you believe in something believe in it all the way. Choose how you use each day of your life. The pages are filled with passion. My best advise after the reading the book a second time is buy one for a friend. ",5.0

Until I read Tickle I never really thought in terms of a second phase of life the way the author presents it (the best one!). I enjoyed Dr. Zoglio's approach to 'reinventing your life' as she takes you through a touching thought provoking empowering process where you will among other things let go of old baggage move out of your comfort zone dream find your purpose and take action. I found the exercises to be fun and easy and they left me feeling enlightened energized and focused.Tickle is loaded with practical wisdom so I suggest a highlighter.

It gives you positive steps to take control of your life. I especially liked the section on dreams. So many people put down the notion that we should have dreams for our life. We should dream and dream big. It's very easy to read and flows easily from chapter to chapter.

" Circa WWII - back in the days when some of our allies were not much better than the enemies we were fighting something happened at Katyn that provides some rather considerable insight on the ways and targets of tyranny. Wipe out the intelligentsia. As in the formative days of America the intelligentsia can be a powerful force for liberty - even counter revolution. When tyrannical change becomes fast and revolutionary the opposition must be wiped out in a single stroke if possible - as at Katyn. The Russians tried to blame it on the Germans and largely succeeded in a day when America was to say the least much more pro-Russia than it was pro-German.The slow revolution presently taking place in America has succeeded in wiping out the intelligentsia in a different not to say more 'moderate' way - death by media - death by the arts - death by academia. Either way truth and liberty end up lying in the streets. Ultimately tyranny is a war against the truth. Perhaps you've noticed there's not much of it around lately.

Lauren has tried to move on but has not had closure on the tragedy so decides it is time to head to the South American country to learn what caused her mother who seemed to have it all to suddenly kill herself.In Peru Lauren nearly dies in what seems like a questionable accident. Only the quick action of local psychiatrist Dr. Armando Torres saves her life. He tells her she should go home as it is not safe for her here. She wonders whether he wants her to leave for his own reasons as she demands he tell her what he knows about her mother's death as he was there when she took her life.NOT WITHOUT THE TRUTH is a fast-paced romantic suspense tale that starts at hyperspeed when Laurena arrives in South America and never slows down until the final altercation. Lauren is a terrific center holding the plot together with her need to know which in turn provides some insight into her mother (at least from her memories). Armando in some ways is the more interesting character as the audience wonders what was his relationship with the mother including how involved was he on the night of the accident.

" I doubt I shall ever come across a better writer of history or Science Fiction in this lifetime.Asimov was a great student of history psychology and science. Unlike most students and academics though Asimov also was a superb writer in each area and could distill the essence of his knowledge into entertaining non-fiction or fiction. Read his books regarding history of civilization or about Black Holes or about religion and I'm sure you will appreciate his knowledge about such diverse topics and his ability to keep you awake at night reading!I'm not saying you will agree with his every point - only that you will be exposed to a well-articulated discussion.In the Foundation series it is clear Asimov has combined history and psychology to an extraordinary degree. The question is was this young man of Russian birth writing of Russia's future or was he merely writing of England's past?You see a great civilization has encompassed all the known world. Then inevitably it will begin a collapse. As in other empires collapse begins in part due to the burdensome administrative hub (Moscow Washington DC or London?) combined with a recession at a time when the outcast and downtrodden are fed up with unemployment and unfulfilled promises of a better future (Eastern Europe or the inner cities of America or Britain). This dilemma is further exacerbated by revolutionaries and terrorists in the hinterlands.Enter Mr. Seldon. Clearly he is based on the alter ego of Asimov himself for the man is a student of mathematics psychology religion and history as well as of politics.I could write a book to dissect the brilliance of the writing and the lessons for all leaders but will simply say that Foundation Foundation & Empire and Second Foundation make up my favorite all-time trilogy. No knock against Lord of the Rings intended. LOTR is terrific but not quite as good. ",5.0

" This book is amazing. After waiting all these years to jump onto the Asimov train I am glad that I am finally here; the book is thoughtful smart and paced wonderfully.

" The first book of Asimov's classic Foundation Trilogy. It is a must-read for any true fan of science fiction. Like other great works of the genre it has held up over time and is one of those books that you'll find yourself going back to read again and again. I highly recommend it. Be sure to also check out the other two books of the Foundation Trilogy 'Foundation and Empire' and 'Second Foundation'. ",5.0
" Here in the second installment of Azimov's fantastic Foundation epic you have a continuation from the first that at first seems a let down. Then the Mule shows up and the action really gets going.The first part is about the General and the reason I say it's a letdown is that what you think is going to happen and hope for the sake of action is going to happen doesn't. It's important that it doens't and makes a good point.The Mule however is where the meat is as others have stipulated. He's a monkey wrench in the whole plan Hari Seldon put together to save humanity during the 'Dark Ages' after the collapse of the Galactic Empire. Well written and a definite must for any who claim to love sci-fi. ",5.0
" I first read Foundation as a bored teen with no idea what it was about. Foundation is a book which demands to be read quickly and thus the impression amidst the brilliant storyline is often shallow.I read it this time in a couple of hours; I would've read it quicker without work and cafes and other impediments but basically I devoured it. And because it read so fast the impressions of the individual stories flickered past too.The sense of history as pattern is stronger in this book than any single narrative. Having read the brilliant new Foundation trilogy written by the three Bs (Brin Benson and Bear) which tells the personal life story of Hari Seldon the very brief treatment of Seldon in the first trilogy is more notable for what is unsaid. Hari is just another name in history for Asimov; the hero is the idea even the fast-flow of the narrative of itself might be called the Hero because the whole notion of story here is webbed against historical patterns so closely.Briefly then Foundation has the setup and three payoffs. The setup is Hari Seldon arranging exile to Terminus.Salvor Hardin's politicization of Terminus is the first payoff and is especially brilliantly written.Smyrnian Trader Limmar Ponyet's chicanery on planet Askone's closed market demonstrates the limits of religion and is the second payoff.Then Hober Mallow's power grab and abandonment of religion for trade as a means for influence in the third.The story starts and ends with court cases first against Hari Seldon and last against Hober Mallow. The ideology of the book is anti-violence and pro social and economic measures. In fact it may be the first really positive exploration of what has come to be called 'soft power' of which the European Union is the present example.The great touches of image serve to cast a deeper shadow on the role of public morality in sustaining a civilisation. For instance the ambassador from Anacreon presents the hilt of his gun as a symbol of peaceful intentions when he visits Salvor Hardin on Terminus.In the context of history the book is extraordinarily complex and sophisticated. Social and economic complexity is reduced and strained free of dense matter and difficulty like consomme soup made to be thin yet delicious and easily consumed. The very first thought I had at the end of reading Foundation was 'how I wish there were a history of Rome so readable and fast and easy to consume!'Normally I read Foundation in a great hurry (as I have this time) in combination with the other two books Foundation and Empire and Second Foundation. But I only have a copy of the first book of the trilogy and must make do with it.The first payoff is quite brilliant because it is delayed and played out indirectly thus deflecting the thrill of emotional rush into intellectual wonder. Specifically Salvon Hardin delays the confrontation between Terminus and Anacreon for thirty years years which Asimov summarizes in a bitter and brilliant battle of words between the old Hardin and young Sek Sermak. Thus the reader feels that the payoff is deferred. The reader senses an even bigger payoff at the far end of the section 'Mayors'. And Asimov does not fail us. For Salvor Hardin travels to Anacreon to personally entrap the evil regent there and defeat him - again inevitably with soft power. Hardin defeats his enemy on the enemy's territory at the precise moment when it seems all is lost for the Foundation.One is left with the distinct impression that brains defeat brawn skilled inaction and insight defeat busyness and boldness and that the power of wisdom and foresight overcomes even a social collapse on the scale of the fall of the Roman Empire - as indeed they did. For the Fall of Rome resulted in the rise of Christendom and with it a grand tradition - so Asimov's message by locating a historical European lesson in the distant future - becomes a timeless affirmation of human excellence.Foundation thus stands virtually alone in the field of science fiction novels in excellence.

" You've already read the publisher's summary for yourself so let me just add that this is THE classic SF trilogy. Book one 'Foundation' creates the future world its declining culture and how a group of strong-minded individuals don't want to see knowledge die. How they do that drives this novel. In book two Asimov introduces the mystery of the mule and in book three Asimov pulls a rabbit out the hat called the Second Foundation.If you enjoy books that entertain books that offer good mysteries and books that make you think about bigger things in life than this series is for you. It's too bad our political leaders don't read novels like this. Maybe we'd avoid the continual messes they get countries in. ",5.0
" Asimov is a must read for any science fiction reader. Even though the writing style leaves something to be desired the pure imagination of his writing is something memorable. It's hard to imagine Star Wars or any other sci-fi without this book. Asimov barrels through time and the universe passing through hundreds of years in the turn of a page in a way that is rich and convincing. He builds many worlds characters and ties it all together through Hari Seldon and his psychohistory (a previously worked out map of human reactions and thus events for generations to come) and the Mule (a mutant who throws a wrench in the plan and--like most bad guys or in this case mutants--seeks world domination). What's incredible about this villian is his strange depth which the reader gets completely secondhand. The book goes on and on with one beautiful idea after another. For example a strange jester/clown character Magnifico that the heroes--Bayta and Torie--pick up plays an instrument called the sono-visor. This instrument harnasses the alpha waves of the brain and mixes melody with image in each listener. Now how's that for cool? Asimov wows the reader again and again with clearly explained inventive ideas. This book is the first of a trilogy. A must read for anyone with an interest in literature or science-fiction. ",5.0
" The Foundation Trilogy is timeless. Asimov is the master. No wonder it won a Hugo for best all-time series.It's the fall of the Galactic Empire and the rise of the Foundation guided by psychohistory (a scientific method of predicting the future) developed by the Foundation's founder Hari Seldon.Classic Sci Fi! ",5.0
" This book sets the stage for the rest of the series. Hari Seldon is introduced and his theories of Psychohistory are explained. Then Seldon's Foundation is established on Terminus a remote planet at the edge of the Empire with the goal of shortening the period of barbarism the universe will experience. However there are no Psychohistorians located in the Foundation... only scientists. The planet has very few native metals and virtually no defenses. The scientists must figure out how to rule their world and fend off avaricious neighbors as the Empire begins to crumble. The majority of this first volume contains vignettes chronicling the Foundation leaders responding to various crises that Hari Seldon predicted centuries before. The crises are varied and plausible. The solutions to the problems that arise are not solved by any miraculous means but by tough clever political maneuvering. Watching the crises and their solutions unfold is very enthralling and keeps you turning the pages at a rapid pace. ",5.0
" This book was recommended to me for a writing exercise and I was surprised to find that I enjoyed it as much as I learned from it. I had lumped Asimov in with Clarke as a boring SF writer and I was quite wrong. This book also works amazing magic with the passage of time and circumstance and despite how quickly characters drop out of the landscape of the novel the reader remains interested. A masterful work from one of the great masters.If you don't know much about SF this is a good book for you; if you are a SF fan who thinks Asimov has nothing to offer you this is a great book for you. Pick it up. ",5.0
" People like to throw five star reviews at just about anything. I suppose they feel that almost everything written is as good as it gets. Foundation is one that deserves all five stars.It's a classic. The premise is intriguing. The story unwinds brilliantly over three books. Don't expect to read The Foundation alone. It does leave you hanging. The next two books in the trilogy are a must.This is one of a handful of solid enduring works that will be enjoyed long after other works fade off the lists... ",5.0
" Ah Foundation this is perhaps one of the best and highly original works of Dr. Asimov. I was impressed that a man of only 20 could come up with such a creative vision of the future it was not only the very distant future but one aside from most of the common stereotypes. This books plot line was excellent he sounded like he really knew what he wanted from the get go and not make it up as he went along. If i had to change a thing it would be; i would like to see some of these characters come to a complete close I'm not saying that i would like to put a stop to the big gaps through time but make the characters have a little more closure.I think that you will get a lot out of this book as far as understanding plain human nature it shows that no matter how far you go into the future there are some human characteristics that will never go away such as faith and greed. Foundation really opens a door for science fiction especially in the two books remaing in the trilogy you should definatly read those as for the other four that is your choice i would read the reviews before reading them.As for Foundation it is an excellent book the characters are as defined as well as can be for the time alotted for them to portray the story. This is a must read epic that spans almost a thousand years (if you read the whole series) ENJOY! ",5.0
" Foundation. Arguably the greatest creation of science fiction to date from the most prolific writer of the genre. Isaac Asimov's tour de force first graced the pages of the May edition of Astounding Science Fiction in 1942. By the time the last instalment of the saga was finished in 1992 (only a matter of weeks prior to Asimov's death) the story had gone full circle so that you finished almost where you had set off from. We are initially told of The Seldon Plan; A one thousand year strategy mathematically and statistically conceived by Hari Seldon to potentially minimise the eventual downfall of the once almost omnipotent but now crumbling Galactic Empire. Seldon's Plan is for a group of specially chosen settlers to emigrate to Terminus an uninhabited planet in a remote corner of the galaxy from where they will create the Encyclopedia Galactica a definitive omnibus of information necessary to aide a new and even stronger Empire rise long after the anarchy of it's predecessors demise.Throughout five of the seven Foundation books Asimov wrote the reader witnesses the unfolding of The Seldon Plan and how the original settlers of Terminus evolve over the centuries as the work of the long dead Seldon comes to fruition. The two 'prelude' books in the series tell of Seldon's life and his initial realisation as a young man the gravity of what must be done to save the people far into the future while simultaneously trying to instigate his master plan.Upon reading the end of the last of the books in a chronological sense (Foundation & Earth) the reader is gifted with the biggest jaw-dropping mother of all twists in the story which turns almost all of what you have read in the previous books upside down. Read Foundation and guaranteed you'll read the other six books all in immediate succession. ",5.0
" Foundation is the first of three books in the original Foundation trilogy. It's a wonderful exploration of what might be if psychology sociology and statistics could be melded together to predict the future with a high degree of reliability. I found it fascinating as a spiritual analogy even if that was unintended by Azimov. Read it through the lens of Hari Seldon as a god-type perhaps you'll find the same interesting subtext that I did.

" I like science fiction in a generalized idea but sometimes in particular it doesn't work. I think this is mainly because I see two kinds of science fiction. One is what are essentially westerns in space. The second tries to give perspective on the current times by creating some sort of objective viewpoint on current events by giving it distance in space or time. Asimov is more of the second one. I haven't read much of his work as an adult but I did like his short stories as a child in magazines. Genre stories until lately haven't had any pull in the academy so they don't get studied or legitimized scholastically. I like this second kind much better.I like this book the first of a trilogy and the foundation for several others (pun intended). Asimov explores our relation to information and the predictability of the future based on full information awareness. I will read more of these books perhaps the whole series because I enjoyed and was tantalized by the possibilities of action in the future of the series. However one interesting thing is that although Asimov was looking to the future he was still a product of his time. When he was writing the technology was nuclear and the future was nuclear. Thus the future Empire is ruled by nuclear technology. Compare for example the cyber-punk fascination with computer technology as a driving force. Computers are almost absent from the world of the Empire and the Foundation. Instead there are still newspapers (96) and messages are transferred physically. At the very least if you take this as a futurological document humanity abandoned mythological superstition. So - you have to read this book as both a look into the future and a historical document. Asimov is a fantastic writer but he couldn't overcome the limitations of his time. ",5.0
" The Foundation series is one of the most renowned arcs in all of science fiction. Spanning several volumes and thousands of years of time Asimov provides us with a blueprint for our own decadent ailing society--a prevention if you will against the society of the 21st century as realized later by men like Stephen Baxter inTitan.In the billion-star inclusive Galactic government Hari Seldon a brilliant mathematician devised a way to accurately plot the future by analyzing past events trends and movements in human history. Branded a madman he and his followers are given a kind of half-exile half-grant to the planet Terminus to found their Foundation which it seems is to be a focal point of knowledge for Seldon's predicted coming galactic catastrophe.But is that all the Foundation is? A glorified university?Asimov is the herald of a new age filled with robots spacetravel and weird technologies beyond our understanding and sometimes even our imagination. A thinker philosopher and theologian Asimov's books are chock-full of singular personality and wit.I recommend Foundation as necessary-reading to any fan of science-fiction who has somehow escaped it thus far. You will NOT be unimpressed. ",5.0
" I never imagined it would have been so political. I also never imagined I'd enjoy a political story so much. The characters are brilliant and well written. I was concerned for them despite how quickly Asimov moved on to the next group. It's more realistic this way than to have just one protagonist that you know will make it to the end of the book. This story take place over a long period of time though it provides for a surprisingly quick read. A good balance of action and brain stimuli. (Not for adrenaline junkies.) ",5.0
" Foundation is the only book I have ever read twice. The second time around I was shocked to realize that not much ever happens. There is something about this series that makes it one of the best I have ever read but I am not sure what it is. ",5.0
" Having always been a big Asimov fan (after readingmany of hisshort stories along with some of the Robot series) I was very excited to start reading the Foundation series. The Foundation series describes a world in which humans live on planets throughout the galaxy. In this world the 12000-year old Empire is in decline and Hari Seldon has established a Foundation in the corner of the galaxy in order to reconquer and rebuild a new empire after the current one dies -- he estimates the intermediary period of barbarism can be reduced from 30000 years to only 1000.Going into the first book of the series I have to say I had high expectations but this book managed to exceed them. Many people complain about the character development in these novels but while each of the five stories introduced new characters I still found each set of characters to be interesting in very important ways. Throughout these stories the question of individuality is touched on",5.0
" Throughout the past 12000 years the Galactic Empire has been expanding from Trantor its capital planet throughout the galaxy. How humans found Trantor or where Earth is (and other questions about Earth) are currently unanswerable. All that is known is that this empire which controls billions of worlds is in a permanent social and political recession -- in other words it is dying. Hari Seldon reknowned psychohistorian (AKA scientist who predicts future trends) has predicted that 30000 years will pass before a second Galactic Empire will rise. To shorten the dark age to 1000 years he has created a Foundation - a group of people dedicated to preserving knowledge - on the edge of the galaxy in the hope that they will share their knowledge after the fall of the Galactic Empire and create a new and greater Galactic Empire. Foundation is divided into four stories which go through history from Seldon's project through the ascent of the Foundation. Taking concepts from Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire Foundation is an extraordinary book and is strongly recommended to all readers of science fiction. ",5.0
" In a word story. That's what this is book is meant story. As a best-class story-teller Asimov leads the reader into an intrincated labyrhynthical STORY where mathematics play a role as important as human emotions meanwhile both are interlaced so closely and deeply that psicohistory raises up to capitalize human knowledge in 'favour' of the final survival of the galactic culture.Despite the general opinion of classical criticism  that Asimov was not quite a good SF writer but a fantasy one with no base to be considered in the universe of 'hard' sci-fi I should say that it's a long way walk between writing and simply reading a book and this may not be the most-spectacular guide to science and techno-details but it's in a way (a very particular one) the best ever writen ",5.0
" Many of the ideas and terminology is very old time and retro. The idea and plot of this book may in fact have kicked off the whole space opera sub-genre that i love so well. For more larger than life galaxy spanning sci fi mind blowing try Vernor Vinge's 'A fire Upon the Deep' ",5.0
" The fall of the Galactic Empire having been foreseen by the great Hari Seldon through his Psychohistory a colony of sorts of scholars was established on a planet far from the center of the Empire.This Foundation as the colony is referred is intended to limit the chaos sure to follow from the Empire's eventual fall. Proceeding the fall various small dominions erupt and for a time the Foundation treads water as a neutral entity but things soon come to a head and action must be taken. Unfortunately scholars are not the best equipped to handle such situations.From the outcome of these events the political structure of the Foundation is altered and from there again does a conflict occur. As there was such a concentration of intellectual beings in the Foundation there was no decline in technology as in the rest of the former Empire. And so might superior technology aid in the well-being of the Foundation as well as its regard from neighbors.This book is actually several separate stories taking place at different times in the early history of the Foundation as the citizens try to fulfill the goal of Hari Seldon now long dead but nonetheless still influential. These stories are very well written and obviously had a great deal of thought put into them as to how the collapse and restoration of such an entity might proceed. If you like REAL science fiction I highly recommend this book you won't regret it. ",5.0
" The Foundation series is the best ever. True it is set in the future but you don't have to like sci-fi at all to appreciate the true brilliance of Isaac Asimov. The Foundation is a short book. Give it a try. I'll be surprised if you don't immediately pick up the next in the series when you are done! ",5.0
" Two stories in one this book is an excellent follow up to Foundation and a dramatization of the strength of mind over muscle.First the Foundation is threateded by the Galactic Empire. While I disagree with the unimportance of the individual (after all wasn't Hari Seldon himself one person who changed history) it does show the travails as a small group of Foundationers try to stop the General when he is stopped by the very corrupt bureaucracy he serves.In the second he brings in a new factor. The Foundation secure and dominant but not agressive is threatened by the Mule a person who can control the emotions of others reshape them into whatever he wants. Part of a slightly more fantastic area of Science Fiction he still pulls it off well. This time it does come down to individual effort again to stop the Mule by opponents who could not defeat him one on one but do so by their determination and individual organization.This time he did not labor under the false assumption that he had to write a limited number of pages so he was able to flesh out the characters more and make the plot twists more intricate and did a truly excellent work.

" This is the second Foundation Novel I have read in the whole series and it just gets me more excited for the rest. This book really brings into light the tone of the series and where it can go. Honestly Asimov is a genius. ",5.0
" SPOILERS AHEAD!!!When I wrote the review for the first book in this series my review was number 336 this time I'm number 90 which probably means that most reviewers said what they had to say about the trilogy in their review of the first book. This is ironic considering this second book is where the real fun begins.I'm assuming here that you read Foundation I'm HOPING you even liked it. If you did then you will probably notice that there are only two stories in this book as opposed to the five in the previous one. Don't let the lack of quantity bother you though These stories are longer for the simple reason that they need to be.For me personally there was always something that bothered me about the premise of this series. Simply put I didn't like the fact that humanity is reduced to mathematics. That's TOO simple though because I happen to think that if you try hard enough you CAN reduce (or perhaps distill is a better word) humankind down to mathematics but the Seldon plan makes no allowance for the individual.At least that's what I thought after reading Foundation. As it turns out these two stories deal with just that theme. Not only that but they seem to state opposite views on the subject.The first part of the book finds the Foundation taking on the remains of the Great Galactic Empire. The heroes of this part are as usual simply the mouthpieces for the various viewpoints and have little personality of their own. They run about and try to save the Foundation with some daring do (but it's Asimov so the said daring do mostly involves people arguing with each other about stuff) while the Foundation calmly trounces the Empire and renders their whole storyline moot.Here the group wins out while the individual is rendered completely impotent while the group kicks butt. So group 1 individual 0Then comes the second (and significantly longer) story",5.0
" The second book in the Foundation series continues the narrative of the first; it chronicles the defeat of the decaying Galactic Empire by the Foundation and its subsequent defeat by the mutant intelligence that is the Mule. Asimov's books are an almost perfect blend of suspense action dialogue character-building world-building narrative and plot. He knows how to keep the pages turning. Even the less interesting half of the book (the first-half) is still enjoyable - it's just that the second part is so much more interesting; the twist at the end is especially something to be savored. Like all his books the joy comes from not just the narrative itself but the situations that Asimov places his characters in and how they ingeniously improvise solutions to their dilemmas. The Foundation series is irrefutably classic science fiction and it makes one wonder why Hollywood hasn't taken these literary gems and processed them into something less fine and lacking luster.One minor grievance; some phrases seem to reappear in multiple books of the series. Asimov seems particularly fond of the adjective 'sardonically' - but this can scarcely be deemed a flaw just something that one might notice. ",5.0
" The second book in the original trilogy and the fourth book overall Foundation and Empire is the great sequel to Foundation. It's really two different stories set many years apart.The first story covers the empires attempt to conquer the First Foundation led by its last great general. The second covers the mutant known as the Mule and his attempt to conquer the entire galaxy. The mysterious Second Foundation comes into play for the first time at the end of this book.Like its predecessor at only 320 pages it makes a quick and interesting read. As one of the few sequels I've ever read which isn't a let down from the book it follows I highly recommend it as well as the rest of the series. ",5.0
" Asimov has crafted a sci-fi masterpiece in this novel. It is this novel that takes the Foundation series to a new level of brilliance. While the original novel is strong this book is stronger. One advanatage of this book over its predecessor is that it is a single story as opposed to a series of novellas. This yields greater investment in the characters as they develop throughout the book. Asimov displays here all the attributes that have earned him monolithic status among sci-fi writers--unforgettable characters ahead-of-his-time technology and an entrancing plot with endless twists and turns. Essential reading for sci-fi fans. ",5.0
" Great book! Second in the series of three novels all three are worth the read. I read all three in about two and half weeks.

" I first read the foundation triology in high school in the early 60's.Nearly 50 years later reading it again was almost like reading forthe first time. Asimov added two more books later but the first threeare the real classics here. The concept of psychohistory may be as importantas the novels are good. I haven't seen any movies made from thesestories but it seems like they deserve that.Before there was ever an x-man there was the mule;that chance of genetic nature of a psi mutant who could change mens mindsas he pleased. The plan couldn't account for this but the second foundationwas never found by the mule. I recognized in the mule a manvery like the French Napoleon who could take advantage ofthe weaknesses of others. In later life Asimov became verymuch 'hard science' orientated so that these early space operatype novels were actually rationalized into an artificial unified time linethat really does a disservice to their original intension in my view.I still like this book with age!

" If you consider Star Wars as George Lucas's answer to Asmiov's 'Foundation' then this is very much in the mode of Episode V. Asimov spent the first book building up his psychohistory paradigm just to knock it down in Foundation and Empire. A much darker and more intense book downbeat in mood and leading to the inevitable conclusion in Second Foundation. ",5.0
" I think asimov truly showed his ability in Foundation and Empire. Whether or not Foundation was better is debatable. But to create 2 knockout novels is pure gift. All the people who say it is bad are wrong. they say you should read a classic. It is a classic! A modern classic! the series deserves a place among Dune and other SF greats. The Mule was stroke of genius. The surprise ending was wonderful. whatever they charge you for this it is a deal. ",5.0
" I recently read Foundation all I can say is Wow!. First let me say this is not STAR WARS and it isn't STAR TREK This is what Science Fiction is all about. Truly epic in every sense of the word Foundation offers us a window into a future so far away Earth is forgotten completly. And like any good epic their is no main character instead the story is a series of short stories. Each story features new characters and plots decades sometimes centuries apart. The best part of this book is that its only part one! I can't recommend this book enough! If you consider yourself a serious Sci-Fi fan then get this book today. ",5.0
" Foundation and Empire is the second of the original Foundation trilogy written in the 1950s. The first book is Foundation and the last is Second Foundation. I enjoyed Foundation but I liked F&E; quite a bit more! Foundation consists of five disconnected short stories too short for adequate development of the settings or characters. F&E; is much more focused containing only two stories the second of which really impressed me.A quick refresher on the background",5.0
" As in Foundation this is actually not a single story. Here are presented two separate episodes in the development of the Foundation toward the establishment of the Second Galactic Empire.The first details the encounter between the growing Foundation and the still-very-powerful Empire. At the forefront is an Imperial General of outstanding ability and charisma. Unfortunately Hari Seldon the architect of the Foundation predicted all this with his psychohistorical calculations. While the general is very successful in his opposition to the Foundation his very nature ensures his downfall.The second story is quite ingenious in that the single large failing of Seldon's psychohistory is brought to light. An individual beyond the predictive nature of psychohistory has appeared and done the impossible. While there is a type of mystery presented Asimov either wanted the reader to know the answer before the characters or he didn't try very hard to obscure the nature of things. But this is a crucial moment in the Foundation's development as they seem to be vulnerable after all. This story depends heavily on a plot element present in all the Robot-Empire- and now Foundation Series",5.0
" When Isaac Asimov was writing at his best he was the one of the best science fiction writers to ever heft a typewriter.He wrote the orginal short stories to make up the Foundation novels in the 1940's for John W. Campbell's Astounding Science Fiction Magazine. In large messure he modelled the history in the stories after the fall of the Roman Empire.Hari Seldon Salvor Hardin Hober Mallow are names that stand in the history of Science Fiction like the names of real people in many ways. 'Violence is the last resort of the incompetent' and 'Never let your morals get in the way of doing what is right' are quotes that every reader of SF knows well.Only names like Jubel Harshaw and David Bowman (who came to life from the pens of Robert Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke) rank with these characters created by Isaac Asimov. I'm not positive if this is the best SF/F novel ever written but it definitely makes the top five list of best SF novels ever written.It is a great loss to the world that Asimov slipped off his mortal coil back in 1992. His writting is great. At least we still have his books. ",5.0

" Recently I picked up a copy of the first book in Issac Asimov's Foundation series for which this review is written. I will not spoil the book in this review as some others have done.The theme was quite interesting. Essentially one man somewhat manipulates humanity into protecting its knowledge and creative abilities by setting them apart from the 'masses' so that they can weather the coming dark ages. The great joke of this book is that Asimov almost makes it seem as if history is pushed forward by the 'masses' themselves but in reality his apparent humanism and rationality comes through as he shows that it is always the 'individual' who in the end can save or destroy humanity.If you are a man (or woman) who cares about how ideas move history if you believe in the sanctity of the individual if you love life then this is a book for you.Asimov is a man of reason and he shows it well throughout this first in what I hope to be an excellent sci-fi series. Often times contemporary authors infuse their lack of values into their books and characters making one wonder who one should be rooting for. Asimov paints a clear picture of the values within man that make him worthy of praise (or not) - reason justice and a love of life.This book can proudly stand side by side with Ayn Rand's Anthem and Orwell's 1984 as a warning to society about the dangers of the 'irrational' in all its glorious forms.

" Iaasic Asimov is one of the best known Science-Fiction Writers and for good reason. He wrote this award-winning book at the age of 21. Foundation is one of the best books I have read to this date.Science Fiction is a broad area and can only be defined by these two words hence the name. Asimov utilizes very realistic facts in a novel placed 15000+ years in the future. In the year 1951 when the novel was written was just 5 years after the first computer showed its face. Yet Asimov utizlizes the common computer and calculator in many scenes in this novel.The use of nuclear power for showing superiority is also used often. This book was way ahead of its time.Anyone who enjoys science fiction or even one who just enjoys being entertained by realistic facts put into a story will enjoy this book. Foundation is also very suspenseful. Such as life-changing decisions to be made assination attempts spaceflight and the exploration of new worlds in detail the reader feels like he is in the mix of the action. ",5.0
" This novel the first in a (50's) series of three has not dated one bit since its first appearance. Like The Lord of the Rings it should really be read in combination with its sequels but the book contains its own strong moments especially the first section on Trantor. I was amazed and moved by the cleverness of Asimov's plots something he is of course well-known for. Highly recommended. ",5.0
" If you had bothered to read the entire series you would know that one of the major heroes in the book is a young girl Arkady. In fact once the Foundation books tie in with the Robot series you will find another woman hero the 'mother of robotics' Dr. Susan Calvin. So your comment about the 'deplorable' lack of women in the Foundation books is off the mark. And the characters are not poorly developed - what you learn about characters like the Mule is staggering - but you wouldn't know that because it is in the second book. I hope you don't do this with all literature - try getting the facts first then give an honest opinion. You will be well respected for it even if most people disagree with you. ",5.0
" I am making my way through the original Foundation trilogy for the third time now and I'm still gaining new appreciation for it. Fifty years after it first appeared Asimov's Foundation series can still justifiably be called a classic. A clear influence on the Star Wars saga and probably Star Trek as well along with a large chunk of all science fiction that has come since. Sure there are a few things to quibble about with this series and with this first book in particular. Asimov's vision of the distant future with its nuclear reactors microfilm communications and picture phones all seems ridiculously quaint today. As the story blasts through several decades interchangeable characters come and go without making much of an impression and this first book is so obviously part of a trilogy that it doesn't have a chance of standing on its own. But that's not the point and by focusing on these quibbles you're missing the forest for the trees. Here Asimov has created a tremendous masterpiece of the imagination that is larger in scope than just about any other literary creation. The saga is built around the intriguing concept of psychohistory in which the movements of huge masses of people can be accurately predicted over thousands of years (while it is still impossible to predict the actions of any one person). An ossifying empire obviously based on the Roman Empire in its death throes is on the verge of horrific collapse when the Foundation is created to subtly change the course of history behind the scenes and gradually rises to prominence and tries to usher in a new golden age. The entire saga (not just this first book) takes place over a thousand years across a whole galaxy while Asimov believably incorporates a full palate of psychology politics and sociology to lend the story credence. Still a masterpiece after all these years. ",5.0
" Well here goes. You mention that Foundation is dated. Of course it is it's 60 years old! You'd be surprised at how badly dated some of the stuff being written today is in 60 years. You say a galactic empire can't be made with 'atomics'; you call it good old nuclear fission. Well not all nuclear power is fission; there is also fusion which was not a bad idea for space travel in 1941. Strike one. You also mention that Asimov writes in the old 60's detective style of writing. So this dated book is writing in a style popular 20 years in the future. Strike two. You ask if anyone edited the corny dialog; you call it tripe. Of course it was edited; it was made into the editors idea of what would sell in 1941! Remember science fiction wasn't taken seriously then; it was supposed to be rather childish. One need only read later Asimov work (something you admittedly haven't done) to see that he wrote for the market at the time. Books such as 'The Gods Themselves' even have (gasp) sex in them something that would never have gotten past any editor at the time of Foundation. And guess what? It was written in 1972 a time when society as a whole was more tolerant and ready to accept such topics. 'The Gods Themselves' would have been banned as obscene in 1941. Strike three. To answer your query - Why in the name of antimatter would a galactic civilization be organized along the lines of a fuedal system as were the Middle Ages? - why not? Just because it isn't very popular nowadays on Earth doesn't mean it can't work elsewhere. Besides the story is a retelling of the decline of Rome - shouldn't there be obvious parallels? Strike four. You mention that the plot doesn't go anywhere. How would you know? You've only read one book. Asimov does a brilliant job of reconciling the original trilogy with the robot novels - especially considering he began the fourth novel 40 years after the original trilogy was written. At a minimum to really understand the story you would have to read at least the next two books. Strike five. You say the book is pointless. Well ask yourself this. If that were true would it have near-unanimous rave reviews? Are you one of a select few that have been able to see the book for what it truly is - a piece of junk? No the reality is that the state of science fiction in 2001 is that it is generally read by intelligent people - thoughtful well-read and informed. The wool hasn't been pulled over their eyes it has been pulled over yours. Strike six. And you misspelled premises and neutrino - Strike seven. You lose. ",5.0

" Foundation clearly deserved its awards and recognition for being a classic science fiction novel. The creative and unique story line presents the reader a sensation of the future. In the beginning of the book Hari Seldon was introduced as a psychohistorian and mathematician who could chart the future of the human race for tens of thousands of years. He predicted a decline of the Galactic Empire which had lasted for twelve thousand years into a state of disorder and barbarism for the next thirty thousand years. Hari Seldon then established the Foundation to serve as the purpose of shortening the period of chaos into a single millennium or less.The book was extremely enjoyable and the pages went by fast. However the only problem I had was that once I got to know the characters the story went on to a situation a couple decades later with new characters. Though it bothered me the way the author wrote his novel was necessary to put a whole century's plot into a book. Despite the many characters in the story the author created a distinct personality for each. Yet each of the leaders in the different parts of the book were similar in a way; they all dealt with conflict extremely calmly and ingeniously. They cleverly manipulated their enemies with their words and were always prepared against threats or opposition. They knew how to win the people's votes even when they were in a weak position to run for a government position. I could not help but to ponder about what I would have done in each of the situations. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone that likes science fiction or anyone who likes reading about how characters cleverly solve their problems. ",5.0
" I think this is a great book by itself and worth the time in reading it but if you have time I would recommend reading the whole series. If you do that you might want to start with 'Prelude to Foundation' but you don't have to. Pick up this book right away! ",5.0

" On first reading of this trilogy starting with Foundation I was a bit bored by the politics. But all three books were in one volume so I kept reading. I'm glad I did! Every time I've read them since I discover something new to love. The ending of this book blew my mind! If there is such a thing as a literary high I was on one for a week after reading this eight years ago. No book or movie you can name comes close to this kind of thrill or scope. And just when I thought Asimov couldn't take it any further he does with a character's last statement. By now the Foundation has gained dominance over its surrounding enemies. All part of Hari Seldon's (the Foundation's founder) Plan. And they are strong enough to face the Empire. The first half of the book is a power struggle of the leaders of the Empire more politics and a small band of traders rebels and scholars who wait for the coming of the 'magicians' to someday be their saviors. The second half of the book follows a small group of people belonging to the Democratic Underground who expect major political changes for the next Seldon Crisis. They hear of a man who calls himself the Mule. Generals surrender to him without a fight. His worst enemies become his most faithful subordinates. They seek him out thinking he can help their cause. No one can explain the success of the Mule. Where did he come from? Was he planned by Hari Seldon? Hari Seldon appears as before as a hologram explaining the crisis and the course of action. But he makes no mention of the Mule. Everything has gone awry and Seldon's plan is out of whack and the galaxy might revert to the 30000 years of barbarism Seldon was trying to avoid. Hari Seldon counted on several things that there would be no major changes in the galaxy's technology such as something that could withstand any bombardment or strange neurobiological weapons; and that human reaction to stimuli would remain constant. If it's not the first it must be the second-- the Mule has mental powers. How do they fight him? By seeking out this Second Foundation. Hari Seldon mentioned it vaguely but there is no record of its purpose and no proof of its existence. This same small band from the D.U. including a psychologist (as the Foundation considers one) set off to the center of what's left of the Empire The planet/city Trantor to search Seldon's records. The whole time managing to stay out of the way of the Mule's path of destruction and ends with the awesome climax I mentioned. Does the Second Foundation even exist? What is their purpose? The psychologist working on overdrive seems to have found its location. 'It was so simple' he said. But he doesn't live to reveal his discovery. Did he really find it or was his mind too distorted to make any sense? There are more surprises and excitement to come in the trilogy's third installment Second Foundation. Some people have the gall to call these books wordy or boring. Keep in mind that Lord of the Rings had its slow parts too but the few exciting parts are what you remember and hold it all together. It's better to take these books as a whole. For that one is not necessarily better than the other two they are all essential to the whole story line. Perhaps someday we can look forward to a mutilated Hollywood version then go back and re-read the books and hold them dear to our hearts. ",5.0
" From Selvor Hardin taking power from the encyclopedists to Hober Mallow conquering Korell by doing absolutely nothing I found this to be the best sci-fi novel ever. Ender's Game and Dune don't hold a candle to it. Each story is a 10 on it's own. The way the foundation grabs victory from apparent defeat is amazing. Even though Isaac Asimov (my favorite sci-fi author) has nuclear power be able to do anything it doesn't take away from the story. It's the best book of the foundation series for sure. If you read sci-fi you've got to read this. ",5.0
" By now you should be familiar with psychohistory and the exploits of Hari Seldon Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow. If that first sentence just left you slightly confused then go pick up Isaac Asimov's 'Foudation' before reading 'Foundation and Empire'. 'Foundation and Empire' picks up where 'Foundation' left off with the First Foundation rapidly expanding throughout the galaxy. In 'The General' (the first half of 'Foundation and Empire) Foundation space bumps up against what remains of the old Empire and the Foundation must square off with Bel Riose the last great Empire general. This story is basically a continuation of the ideas started in 'Foundation'. 'The General' is definitely the weaker of the two stories in 'Foundation and Empire' however it is a necessary story to show the growing strength and influence of the First Foundation as well as the decline of the Empire.'The Mule' (the second half of 'Foundation and Empire') tells the story of the Mule a mysterious galactic superpower who begins conquering planets in Foundation space. The leaders of the Foundation struggle against their new enemy and try to figure what it is that makes the Mule so efficient and effective. Meanwhile a small group of characters working for an underground group try to find the all important location of the Second Foundation before the Mule can beat them to it. The ending of 'The Mule' is absolutely amazing and the grand reveal at the end can be foreseen by an observant reader which makes it all the more satisfying.In short 'Foundation and Empire' along with the rest of Asimov's Foundation Series is a great science fiction story beautifully blending advanced mathematical and scientific ideas with good ol' fashioned adventure. Some readers complain that Asimov's characters are not as deep as they could be and they do have a point but Asimov never wrote the Foundation books with the intent of having deep realistic characters; it was all about the story and the ideas. If you are looking for strong characters in your science fiction then go read Heinlein however if you are looking for a drop dead fantatic story propelled by great scientific speculation then you can't go wrong with picking up 'Foundation and Empire' and the rest of the Foundation Series.

" This is tied for first place in all books I have read (other book is Atlas Shrugged). The series in all is great but this book tops them all. Imagine a combination of psychology and math used to predict the outcome of population mobs and how a man would apply it to an empire he sees falling apart (not really a spoiler cause that's a bit of what they tell you in first 2ish chapters). This book is great not just because of the idea but because the characters are relatable face extremely difficult situations and yet take what seems to be the only logical way out. I highly suggest you read this book and the whole series. ",5.0

" Isaac Asimov's 'Foundation' was my favorite book in high school. I read the other 2 books afterwards 'Foundation and Empire' and 'Second Foundation' right after and by then Asimov finally finished what he started so long ago by writing new books to the Foundation saga more Robot novels and prequels. I am re-reading Foundation right now only this time on my Kindle. It's just as good now as it was 20+ years ago. Asimov's novels remind me of Star Trek because the stories could probably fit in any time or place including right now. My only issue is that Asimov is deceased for a number of years now. Other writers have tried to take on the challenge of continuing his stories but no one tells a story like Asimov! ",5.0
" Over the years I have read a great many books from many many authors and yet the 'Foundation' series pops back into my head somewhat regularly. I often wonder why it has not been made into a series of movies. After all in my mind it would rival 'Star Wars' or 'Lord of the Rings'. Isaac Asimov was a gifted writer and I was fortunate to know his works while he still lived. Unfortunately I never got to meet the man. This series is some of the best stuff he ever wrote. It delves into humananity and how our unique abilities may sometimes stand out. In the case of 'Foundation' it centers around one empire and it's unusual ruler that expands their domain beyond any other into the far reaches of space. It looks closely at how a handful of people truly make a difference in the scheme of things and what becomes of that empire. Another great series the 'Robot' series was later linked to this series and although I enjoyed the link not everyone may enjoy it. Nonetheless you should read the 'Robot' series as well if you get the chance. I will be very surprised if after you set the 'Foundation' series aside it doesn't make you reflect on it the rest of your life. Excellent read from a master of SciFi. ",5.0
" To me the Foundation series is the greatest sci-fi series of all time. The earlier books are the best as the latter books aren't as good. This is favorite of the earlier books.It's broken into two halves. The first half is pretty good but it's really the second half called The Mule that's incredible. It's fantastic.It's style isn't like modern sci-fi which is usually dark and action-packed. If that's what you're looking for you won't enjoy this series. This series is much more about imagining a universe with a certain set of rules and how those rules might play out over time. To enjoy it you have to think and imagine along with Asimov. If that 'golden age' style sci-fi suites your taste you will love this book.Obviously you can't read this book in isolation. You really need to read the Foundation before it and Second Foundation after it. The three togother make the best triology I've ever read. After those three you can continue but the quality of the books trails off from there.If you're a 'golden age' sci-fi fan and somehow haven't already read the Foundation series get the first three Foundation books. You'll really enjoy them especially The Mule. ",5.0

" Fifteen years ago this book was the zenith of SF to me. Today I know there are many better books. But you should read it anyway it's a classic. You can't be taken seriously in any SF discussion if you aren't familiar with the great Foundation.Isaac Asimov is of course a very skilled writer. Most SF writers allow themselves embarrassing blunders that make their universes physically absurd. In this book you're not likely to find anything like that. To really appreciate Mr. Asimov's genius you should read other SF novels written in the same time. Nearly all of them look ridiculous in the year 2000. Mr. Asimov's books don't. If you wouldn't know you couldn't tell that the book was written half a century ago. ",5.0

" Foundation is the first book of the outstanding Foundation Trilogy. Asimov builds drama with believable characters struggling against bureaucracies and political manipulations on a grand scale. As a central government weakens planets often show less respect for the core authorities and go there own way sometimes forming their own alliances. Hari Seldon master of Psychohistory uses Psychohistory to make predictions far into the future. Hari Seldon does more than predict outcomes--he has a plan. Seldon does not expect to alter the eventual course of huge historical events but constructs a strategy to minimize the length of time of the darkest days for the Galactic Empire.The emphasis of the book and what makes the book a true science fiction classic is the imagination that takes the reader through mind whirring possibilities for the future.

" 'Foundation and Empire' the second in a trilogy of classic science fiction novels by Isaac Asimov is a must read for historians of science fiction. For those who like science fiction itself this volume is also valuable. Asimov can madden especially in his early novels but his imagination is wonderful. His strength is conceptualizing systems (whether empires or cultures) and he often plays with big ideas.I first read the trilogy while in college and was fascinated. This triggered a long-lasting interest in the fiction of Isaac Asimov (and some of his non-fiction works as well).Those familiar with this trilogy know that the key character is psychohistorian Hari Seldon who believes that one can predict the behavior of large masses of people via mathematical equations and thus predict how events will develop in the future.This book is a bridge between the novel 'Foundation' and the third in the series 'Second Foundation.' And of course later in his career Asimov returned to the Foundation well--with more interesting and literary results. Indeed in one of the great tour de forces in science fiction he ends up linking two classic series--the robot works and the Foundation series. But I'm getting way ahead of myself.This novel focuses on two instances--one the rise of a youthful and talented military leader who goes after the Foundation. And just as Hari Seldon's mathematical equations predicted he failed. The logic for this is classic Asimov and is why he was so entertaining to read even though his characters have little life in these works and even though his writing style is at best functional in these works (he improved with time).Then there is the case of the Mule where Seldon's equations failed in prediction. And that itself is fascinating as explained in this novel. Thus the comparison of the correct prediction and the failed prediction add some real heft to Asimov's tale of the rise of the Foundation as the Empire slowly descends to its end.For those who have never read Asimov the Foundation trilogy is a good place to get a sense of his talents of seeing big pictures. His writing style is not great but the images of this future that he developed are compelling. I still enjoy going back to the Foundation series the Robot series and their fusion as Asimov's vision evolved. ",5.0

" Isaac Asimov's 'Foundation' was not conceived as the beginning of series of novels. It was not conceived as a novel. It was not even conceived entirely by Isaac Asimov.Beginning in the late 1930s and for decades thereafter the editor of the most prestigious and far more important the best-paying monthly publication in science fiction was John W. Campbell of Astounding Science Fiction (now known as Analog.)Before taking over the editorship of the magazine Campbell had been a popular hack writer of unabashed wild-eyed space opera. A typical Campbell plot involved a couple of young American go-getters who whomp up a superduper space cruiser in their garage set out on a test flight around Saturn find themselves hurled into another dimension by a short circuit and stumble on a planet inhabited by humans who are at war with some interplanetary Nasties who display unusually bad table manners. They forge an alliance with the good humans against the bad Nasties which a few hundred pages later inevitably leads to the utter annihilation of the world of the Nasties not to mention the Nasties themselves and every vestige of their million year-old civilization and culture. By the literary standards of pulp magazine science fiction in 1936 this was pretty sophisticated stuff.When Campbell took over the reins of the magazine in 1938 he raised his sights. In short order he dumped the old stable of writers whose collective knowledge of science could have been stuffed into a peanut shell with room to spare and began cultivating new ones. A. E. van Vogt specialized in social science mumbo-jumbo that actually sounded like it meant something. L. Sprague deCamp had a sense of humor. Robert Heinlein possessed a literary spark that might be carefully fanned into a flame. And Isaac Asimov was a college kid from Brooklyn who wrote stories to stretch out the limited income generated by his father's candy store.All these and many others were overawed by the wondrous fact that the godlike JWC deigned to accept their humble stories--after he mercilessly picked apart their flaws and demanded re-writes pronto!Those were the heroic days of magazine publishing. Editors in general and Campbell in particular did not wait for undisciplined and slothful writers to hatch ideas. No JWC would call in his disciples and hand out plot lines and devices to be made into short stories novelets and serialized novels. To van Vogt he tossed the idea of a totalitarian society whose tyranny was leavened by weapons shops that sold guns which could only be used in self defense. From deCamp citing Mark Twain's 'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' he demanded to know what would happen if a contemporary American were hurled back from Mussolini's Italy to post-imperial Rome. Of Heinlein he demanded a series of stories that would collectively outline the history of the next few hundred years. For Asimov he reserved a far larger patch of history. What he queried would happen when a galaxy-spanning empire finally decayed and began to fall?Asimov pondered. Then in his own words 'With a little bit of cribbin' / From the works of Edward Gibbon / And that Greek Thucydides' Asimov took the Roman Empire of the Fifth Century and cast it into the stars as the expiring Empire of Trantor. From Eighteenth Century France he took the Encyclopedists and renamed them the Foundation. Finally he spiced up his literary gumbo with blather about 'psychohistory' a mathematically-based fortune telling system which yielded valid results when the human population achieved the vast numbers only attainable in a galaxy-spanning civilization.Campbell bought the first story. The fans--at the time a demographic aged 12-25 and virtually all-male--loved it. Campbell ordered more stories. The Trantorian Empire fell but slowly and reluctantly. The fans loved it. The Empire blazed up under the last great imperial general Bel Riose. (Gibbon's Belisarius get it?) The fans loved it. A Napoleon-like conqueror appeared to muddy up the predictions of the psychohistorians. The fans loved it. Darkness and barbarism followed the collapse of civilization across the Milky Way. And the fans loved it. On and on it went to book to trilogy beyond--even to new books written by other hands long after the passing of Campbell and Asimov.The fans still love it. ",5.0
" Foundation is not a novel but a series of stories which had been published separately. The entire trilogy was written in nine stories which were completed in the period between 1941 and 1951. Asimov notes himself in the foreword that part of what he intended with the fourth book _Foundation's Edge_ was to have a chance to write an actual Foundation novel.I actually like the effect that the story-based approach gives particularly considering that Foundation is meant to be covering the fall of galactic empire and the rise of a new power. Having chapters based on discrete periods I think the reader gets a better sense of the sheer time involved in politics than any 9000 -page space opera could ever achieve.One of the things I like about Foundation and its subsequent other parts is that it isn't an action-packed adventure. There isn't high romance. It isn't really about individual heartache and success although the role of the individual is important. It's a meditative look at both politics and the future and a darned sharp one at that.An excellent read even worth the time for people who don't think that they like science fiction. ",5.0
" Personally I don't like 'classic' sci-fi. It can be preachy dated dry corny or just not as 'mature' as modern science fiction. However Asimov gives just enough characterization not too much science and the right amount of action adventure and conceptual gems to keep your mind racing. He truly is the grand daddy of science fiction.Quirky lines like 'Galaxy knows!' or 'By Seldon!' evoke nostalgia for the time of space rangers and laser guns. So what if nuclear power is a thing of the past? Asimov doesn't beat you down with tecnobabble. You just know that thats the prime power source in his idea of the future. Remember this was written in 1941. Furthermore the writing style and dialogue don't seem dated at all. Asimov's writing is simple clean and doesn't get bogged down with excess ramblings. His true talent is in plotting unexpected twists and turns that make this book a pageturner.Hari Seldon created psychohistory. It is mathematics applied to the development of human society on a grand scale. Seldon's new science predicts the path of human civilization with no regard to individual actions. Religion has given us fate vs. free will. Asimov poses a perhaps even more frustrating question what if science tells us that one man's will cannot change the path of history?You're not going to get soliquoys droning on and on about a lost love or a crumbled courage; But what you do get is a brilliant collection of short stories Asimov wrote separately that later were compiled as one novel.The four(?) stories are brief yet cohesive glimpses into the developing stages of the Foundation's rise amidst the decay of the Imperial Empire. Each character driven event propels the Foundation through its first stages of development",5.0
" Asimov's classic series has a quaint nave simplicity about it that never fails to entrance this reader. For all its episodic construction (unavoidable considering the unparalleled scope) and its rather flat exclusively male characters the Foundation Trilogy takes readers back to a time when America was making the world safe for democracy personal freedoms were a given and science seemed to be the salvation of a fallible humanity.The first volume Foundation sets up the whole idea of the Seldon Plan a mathematically based view of sociopolitical forces that enables one brilliant scientist to mold a new galactic empire from a foundation of one hundred thousand scientists and their families. After the introduction whose final paragraphs subtly lay out the whole structure without our knowing it we get to see the Plan in action as the Foundation faces a series of political and military crises. Because the scientist/hero is long dead before the second chapter the heroes are the political and economic rather than scientific leaders who must resist the temptation to take direct military action and instead allow events to proceed until Seldon's Plan points out the answer. The magic of this book is the exquisite means the Foundation uses to defeat its enemies without resorting to force and the convincing arguments Asimov uses to make these solutions seem inevitable. As such each chapter is like a sociopolitical puzzle that challenges the reader to find the move that will defuse each situation and taken together these stories comprise a virtual primer in diplomacy.Countless millions of fans have enjoyed Asimov's Foundation Trilogy consisting of Foundation Foundation and Empire and Second Foundation. Other Foundation novels written by the master in his later years lack the simple charm that makes these earlier works so popular. They were tacked on solely because the power of those first three created a demand that Asimov felt obligated to try to fill but they have an entirely different feel and don't possess that single-minded surety of artistic vision that marked the original series.This book is about political maneuvering not action so it may not be a favorite of action/adventure fans although the next book in the series Foundation and Empire is a little more dynamic and reading the complete Trilogy is a must since the first two volumes don't so much end as just leave off. Still the vast historical vision begun in this book is so sweeping it should not be missed by any fans of speculative fiction. ",5.0
" This book is the best scifi besides Dune. The book is so witty and so indepth. The story is great the writting is great i strongly recamend this book. ",5.0
" The original Foundation trilogy won the Hugo for the best series of all time. It deserved it. For those who like 'hard' (science-driven) sci-fi as opposed to emotion-driven sci-fi this is a must. Actually the premise is not as outrageous as it first appears... We can all vaguely predict the general reaction of the human race to a certain idea which means it does follow some rules. It would be difficult but not impossible to find some generalised maths to describe it but the rewards would certainly justify it. ",5.0
" This review is intended for the entire Foundation trilogy and as such this series of books even though written in pieces in Science Fiction magazines is woven together in an astonishingly complex web of ideas and mystery. This series stands as the epitome of the science fiction classic what science fiction should be about and how it should be written. As a classic it is only superseded by 'Dune' and only a few others come close eg 'Ender's Game' (Orson Scott Card) series and the 'Galactic Milieu' series (Julian May). The whole series is epic and yet does not loose sight of the characters or the story which is all important in science fiction without it the wizz-bang effect takes hold and the whole thing collapses eg Terminator could not have been held together without the excellent storyline. Other examples of great science fiction stories include 'Blade Runner' and 'Alien' both of which had great stories without a reliance on effects which some films have done eg the extra added graphics to the original Star Wars and too much graphics in Episode 1.These stories also provide a fascinating tale of science yet to come such as psychohistory which totally fascinated me when I read about it and some other physicists I have known. The possibilities are incredible a science of probabilistic mathematics used to predict the future given historical events. In addition we are of course confronted with the politics and the usual human weaknesses including greed corruption and the like much akin to the degenerate aspects of the Roman Empire. The new mathematics of psychohistory developed by Hari Seldon working on Trantor and trying to set up the two Foundations to at least control the eventual collapse and fall of humanity into a dark age and the Mule the one person not predicted by the original theory who is the defeated through remarkable twists and turns in the story which is full of intrigue and mystery simply unputdownable. I have read the books many times and will do so again although psychohistorical mathematics is beyond current attainability I believe but then maybe not.Other books are judged next to this. ",5.0
" I've seen a few bad reviews of Isaac Asimov's Foundation and it grieves me really grieves me. When Isaac Asimov first came up with the idea for his Foundation series it was planned that he would write the future history of our galaxy. It could be said that it was an experiment in a method of writing fiction.If Asimov's characterizations or scenery descriptions seem bland or garish to some readers that's because Asimov's focus was on the story. Despite Foundation's original ad hoc nature I have read no other series which has so intricately weaven the elements of the plot so finely together. Alone the novel Foundation may seem mundane and it may not be your best bet if you're seeking instant gratification. But together - together with the other two books in the trilogy together with the two later written sequels together with the later two written prequels together with his other bodies of work which have been woven into an expansive interplay of stories and plot together with three 'pre'prequels written posthumously by outside authors I know no greater complicated work that brings with it such depth and expansiveness.In short Foundation serves as a sounding board for a series of future historical accounts. And Asimov never fails to deliver suspense drama and surprise throughout them.But that's just my biased opinion ;) ",5.0
" So you're thinking about delving into Science Fiction and you just don't know where to start.Start with Asimov's _Foundation_. Simply put this is where science fiction starts. You will be introduced to the concept of a vast complex history of a civilization which is certainly not Planet Earth... and get this it was written several decades before we sent anyone to the moon.And there's more... Foundation leads to an entire trilogy which leads to another trilogy which get this actually leads you back to Planet Earth.Five stars. Possibly more. ",5.0
" I would recommend this series to anyone. Asimov is a great writer who's very prolific (He's written over 400 books! ) This is the start of his Foundation series which is a well-developed series detailing the fall of a Galactic Empire and one man's attempt to shorten the dark ages that are to come after the fall. For those of you who like hard sci-fi this is the series for you. ",5.0
" Ultimately the hardest decision about the Foundation books is to decide how to read them. Maybe I'm being ridiculous but I think you will enjoy them more if you read them in the order they were written. If so this is the second book. If you have not yet read Foundation then you need to go back and do so before tackling this one.Your other choice is to read the prequels first then go onto Foundation. In that case this is the fourth book you should read.Whichever choice you make don't read this book first.On the surface Foundation and Empire will seem like an uninspired playing out of Hari Seldon's vision for the future. Ah! But there's much more happening so pay attention. When you get to the end of the book you may find you have missed the mainstream and will have to go back. Don't worry almost everyone has that reaction.Asimov is a brilliant conceptual writer but not someone who slaved over every word (in fact he was famous for writing most of his many books in only 1 or 2 drafts with little editing after that). This book begins to develop the full Foundation concept in all of its stunning beauty.In many ways you will be reading this book from the eyes of the first Foundation. But that's the unimportant one. The real action is with the second Foundation. Be sure to keep that in mind.When you meet the Mule don't think of him as an aberration but rather as an extension of today's potential. That will make the book more interesting for you.Many people find this book to be the least interesting one of the Foundation series. Let me warn you that reading this one will greatly increase your pleasure in the following books beginning with the Second Foundation (which is your next pleasant reading assignment).Enjoy this irresistible series! ",5.0
" You can read the publisher's summary for yourself but let me just add that this is THE classic SF trilogy. Book one 'Foundation' creates the future world its declining culture and how a group of strong-minded individuals don't want to see knowledge die. How they do that drives this novel. In book two Asimov introduces the mystery of the mule and in book three Asimov pulls a rabbit out the hat called the Second Foundation.If you enjoy books that entertain books that offer good mysteries and books that make you think about bigger things in life than this series is for you. It's too bad our political leaders don't read novels like this. Maybe we'd avoid the continual messes they get countries in. ",5.0
" I have not readf the Foundation series in years. However the other day I was thinking about how much fun the trilogy had been. One has to remember that most of the scifi you read today has at least some of its roots based in Asimov's work Asimov was not the best writer nor was he the most creative. What he did accomplish was selling you another time and world that you could believe in. So taking it for what it is not a great piece of literature but a really enjoyable trip i need to give the trilogy 5 stars. ",5.0
" I always prefer to think of the foundation Trilogy as one book.They are meant to be read one after another and are also written that way.While the first part(Foundation) gives us the historical perspective and a sketch of characters who influence the eventsthis book is where it gets better in a serious way!!There is not much of a point in discussing the plot-lots of other people have commented on that.But i'll tell you this - the 2nd part of this book- which talks about the Mule and his rise to power is THE best part of the ENTIRE FOUNDATION series ( Yes all the 7 books!!).IT ends with the most famous twist on paper it will make your mind reel!! It sets up the things nicely for the Second foundation - the 3 book in the series.I have read almost everything that Asimov's written.The foundation series and the End of Eternity are my favourites.The difference between Asimov and the other Science Fiction writers is that he makes the Science Fiction believable.Asimov is also a very good mystery writer(no kidding!! - he's right up there with the authors who write mystery alone).It's easy to write a Sci Fi book with an amazing amount of Science and imagination- but how well you can bind it to a story and make it real that is the deal.Apart from the idea the story has to be told well. This is where the good doctor excelled.Trust me if you have not read the Foundation Series you are missing something which in indelibly written in the records as the one of the best books on paper.Asimov's written it so that you are sufficiently intrested for more at the end of the book one  by the time you finish the second book you are thinking this is great stuff - desperate for more you go the 3rd book. By the time you are through you think this is soooo cool - it might be the best thing you ever read.Do yourself a favour go read the Foundation and Empire  follow that up with the Second Foundation.You'll be glad you did when you return to it over the years!! ",5.0
" I just finished Foundation and Empire and so far it is my favorite in the series....Foundation presented us a struggling organization of scientists on the Planet Terminus who must deal with the newly formed barbarian kingdoms that arise from the retreating Empire. Important figures within the Foundation use religion trade and technology to dominate over adversarial planets....In Foundation and Empire we are given a new perspective on the Foundation. Before we were lead to believe that the Foundation must survive and that no one could hinder its progess; that Hari Seldon's predictions of the Foundation were infallible; that the 1000 year plan was set in stone and that a new Galactic Empire will arrise in such time thanks to Hari Seldon. However these beliefs are put into question when an individual calling himself 'The Mule' threatens to destroy Hari Seldon's 300 year old project. He is a mutant of considerable mental powers who can seemingly convert anyone into his cause even the greatest opponent. Thus we are asked 'Does Hari Seldon's precious Psychohistory take random genetic mutation into account? If not then is it possible for the Mule to destroy the Foundation?'...I loved the ending to Foundation and Empire. Like Empire Stikes Back it leaves you hanging desperately wanting to find out what happens to the main characters (and the galaxy) after the book ends....I've always loved enigmatic characters in books. The Mule fits this catagory which in my mind makes him even more sinister and evil. We never see him or hear him speak (for all those who have read the book don't say anything) and yet we experience his destructive force. It reminds me of Sauron of The Lord of the Rings. At the end however we are given a profound revelation of the Mule that adds a new dimension to his character....All in all it was the dispair and depression in the book that captured me. There was little hope and yet the human spirit was still evident. I applaud Asimov for creating a believable story in which death destruction and dispair overshadow an entire galaxy but hope and determination remain. This theme I think is present throughout the series and in my opinion is the most important human quality that makes us who we are. The foundation is ultimately an exploration of this theme. Clearly Hope is the most formiddble force that human history and according to Asimov the galaxy has ever seen. ",5.0

There are 14 books in the series! In the end it was R.

" The time frame in which the book takes place can best be described as 'A Long time ahead in a galaxy far far away'. Yes that is a cheesy Star Wars cliche. However readers expecting anything star warsey about this should expect to be sorely disappointed. This book focuses primarily on politics. There is not one ounce of violence in the book which is a good thing it is a nice break from almost everyother contemporary scifi novel which all seem to impress people with their space ships 'n' aliens. The book is very good but sometimes does get a little boring. I suppose this may be my fault as I do have a short attention span. Anyhow this book does a few twists in it as everything may not be what it seems with Hari Seldons dream!So if you've been on the fringe of being a sci fi fan but detest the embarassment of carrying around a book with giant robots on it this book is for you.

" Foundation is the story of one man's attempt to positively influence human history beyond the grave for centuries to come. Set far in the future Hari Seldon's goal is to shorten an impending period of Dark Ages from tens of thousands of years to one thousand years. To do so he creates an organizational entity the Foundation and maneuvers to create circumstances so that the Foundation will recreate the Galactic Empire amid a blossoming of science and technology.This book is the first in a series that will keep you happily reading for days. In Foundation the stage is set for the problem and you will begin to understand the plan that Seldon has employed by examining the first 150 years after the Foundation is established.The book is built around four crises (Seldon Crises) that shape the potential of the First Foundation to fulfill its goal. In the first crisis the Foundation is viewed as being a traitorous activity by the political authorities. Seldon explains that his purpose is to create an encyclopedia to encompass all current knowledge before it is lost. The crisis is survived when he agrees to take the project into exile on a planet with few natural resources at the far edge of the galaxy.Fifty years later that fledgling is threatened by its powerful neighbors who have greater resources and military power. The Emperor can no longer protect the Foundation. Thirty years after that another attempt to militarily capture the Foundation occurs. Another seventy years later a fourth crisis occurs when remnants of the Empire start funneling advanced weapons to planets at the edge of galaxy that oppose the Foundation.Each crisis is overcome with a different approach by a different leader. And the Foundation continues to develop towards its eventual form.These crises are much like a good mystery story. You know there's been a crime that needs to be solved but you haven't quite figured out how yet. Because there are four crises you get to enjoy that problem-solving experience four times in one book! Pretty neat!The Foundation's advantage in all of these crises is that it has advanced knowledge and has applied it while the rest of the Empire is losing knowledge. Pretty soon things are falling apart technically for those outside the Foundation. The key technology is built around atomic power (as it appeared it would developed in the 1950s).Reviewing Foundation is a challenging task. This book has become a science fiction classic yet many will see little value in it because the science fiction perspectives and forecasts about science are dated. The book has to be read in the context of the books that follow to be fully understood and appreciated but how does that help the person who has just finished Foundation? Isaac Asimov used a most unusual style in the book as though you are a historian uncovering bits of primary and secondary sources concerning a long ago period in time (that occurs in our future). That either makes the book more authentic (if you like that) or annoying (if you don't).At bottom these contrasts require the reviewer to attempt to capture for the potential reader what makes this book an enduring classic.First Foundation squarely asks a fundamental question",5.0
" In his Foundation Trilogy (later to be extended in additional books) the prolific science fiction/fact writer Isaac Asimov told a story of a small group of people who secretly steered the course of history using technology that we would now recognize as an outgrowth of memetics. By recognizing group psychology and the effect of various memes on populations they were able (Asimov creates) to shorten the intergalactic Dark Ages by millennia. Is such a thing possible? We are seeing the beginnings of attempts at memetic engineering today. Advertisers are designing memes that are becoming fairly effective at penetrating populations in hope that they will carry with them a message influencing consumer buying behavior. Have you heard someone say 'I love ya man!' lately? Anheuser-Busch is delighted if you have. More broadly I'm seeing a steady trickle of organizations copying and mutating successful Profit Viruses (MLMs) and Power Viruses (cults). It's an interesting question whether the population as a whole will ever build up an 'immunity' to this kind of thing or whether the evolutionary-psychology buttons of lust power fear and so on are too powerful to overcome. Who knows? There may have been a small group of Illuminati steering us for millennia past without us even knowing...--Richard Brodie author Virus of the Mind",5.0
" In response to the reader from San Fransisco who gave this book a 3 they should know that the reasons the characters don't match up is because the first three foundation books were written 30 years before the last three. Furthermore they were written out of order Foundation was the first and the other two Prelude to Foundation and Forward the Foundation were written 35-40 years later. Also the stories were not 'tacked on' each of the first three books is actually a collection of connected novellas which orignally were published seperately in magazines. ",5.0
" Simply the best science fiction series ever. No one macthesAsimov in the combination of thought provoking futurism andsheer out and out entertainment. This book will get youstarted on the rest of the series (which you willimmediately want to read) and hopefully on a long career ofreading all of Asimov's fiction. The Good Doctor's greatestcontribution to the genre is the notion that brains willalways win out over brawn. His plot twists never turn onmajor battles or laser fights but always with the triumphof reason. It's all here in abundance. ",5.0
" Though 'Foundation' was later tied to many other novels and stories that Isaac Asimov wrote many of us considered this story to be the first of the Foundation Trilogy. We meet Hari Seldon and learn of the beginning of psychohistory. Hari has predicted using psychohistory that the 12000 year old galactic empire is facing eminent collapse. Hari determined through this calculations that the collapse of the empire will lead to 30000 years of chaos before a second empire forms. Hari also determined that by taking certain actions that the 30000 years of chaos could be shortened to 1000 years.Considering that this novel is only 256 pages long it covers a lot of ground. The novel begins on the ultra-urbanized planet Trantor and then heads to the edge of the galaxy. We watch the empire collapse and then the struggles of the Foundation as they attempt to re-start civilization. We also watch as the Foundation changes from a religious organization to a scientific one.This novel is the best of the first three Foundation books. Part of the reason may be that these stories were originally short stories. Also Asimov was not trying to form a single cohesive story lasting 1000 years; at this time he was just trying to launch an idea. I sometimes think it is easier to launch an epic adventure than it is to evolve the epic over hundreds or thousands of pages. Certainly Asimov's launch in this book was grand and is one of the best classic science fiction novels.The next two books in this series are 'Foundation and Empire' and 'Second Foundation.'Enjoy!

" We already knew that 'psychohistorian' Hari Seldon had predicted the demise of the galactic empire and to shorten the length of time for 'barbarism' he established two Foundations. He placed these at oppposite ends of the galaxy one known one unknown. Things were going smoothly until the periodic prediction (when Seldon appears holographically) was obviously wrong.The cause is the Mule a mutant of incredible mental powers who no one has ever seen. The introduction of this character was one of the best plot devices used in a long time and it gave the fledging story a much-needed boost. Who is this mutant and why does he do the things he does?

" This is truly a defining book for the genre of science fiction. The beauty of this tale is that Asimov began penning it when he was only twenty one years old. The story centers around a falling empire and the many characters throughout its history that define it. It also deals with a sort of scientific prophecy in what is termed 'psychohistory'. This is the manner in which the future can be predicted using scientific evidence and the laws of probability. This is truly a masterpiece of the genre. A standard which all sci-fi authors should hope to attain. I would recommend this read to anyone that is a science fiction fan. Many readers are familiar with Orson Scott Card. This is the novel which prompted him to become a writer. That this novel is a cornerstone in the genre is an understatment. ",5.0

" There's so much to be said for Foundation. We start out with the psychohistorians with their leader Hari Seldon who has predicted a 10000 year Empire is about to crash to its knees and herald in a new Dark Ages. Hari can't stop the Dark Ages but he can shorten it.Interestingly he creates a priest class that runs the 'nucleonics' of the Foundation its erstwhile goal of creating an Encyclopedia Galactica set aside by stemming the tide of losing technology.You see the Empire is losing its grip on the other sectors of the galaxy. More and more are dividing and becoming their own little kingdoms. The book centers around several characters who through inside and cleverness make things happen to keep the Foundation and create an insidious society that keeps it going.Asimov as an author I have always been impressed with. His ability to create and predict (micro-miniaturization) parodies and criticism of religion and science trade and technology is throughout the book.Near the end we find that The Foundation is set to expand. Each chapter stands on its own and can be difficult for some to follow. But each chapter expands decades some more and as such can be hard to keep up.Highly recommended.

I find this satisfying in a way similar to the Dune series but I didn't have to read 6 books.As with every Asimov book I've read the plots in this book are forged and hewn into complicated machines that are disassembled before your eyes at just the right climactic moment. It makes for a hard book to put down. ",5.0
" The Foundation is a series of books about two Foundations at the end of the Galaxy at the rotting fringes of the Galactic Empire. Psychohistorian Hari Seldon has predicted the fall of the Galactic Empire and 30000 years of barbarism that will follow. The Foundations are established at two opposite edges of the Galaxy little settlements that contain all human knowledge. The problem is that there are certain crises that the Foundations must overcome with as little guidence from Seldon as possible.This was the first Asimov book I've ever read so I didn't know really what to expect. I found I loved it! It was full of interesting characters and each novelette showed a different point of time in the Foundation so instead of slowly going through each year in the 1000 years of barbarism you actually get somewhere. The characters had pros and cons to them and seemed well rounded. It also showed a change in character through time such as characters that were once sharp become dull and characters that used to rebel fall in line. Instead of telling you all about the character on the first page it gave a general idea and then let the story tell the characters. One part I really liked was that it had plot twists that I didn't see coming and the plot wasn't completely transparent.In the end this book was a very interesting sci-fi novel that kept me going and held my interest until the end.

" I realize that it is a fairly arrogant thing to think that I have something new to say about this classic work that the 335 people who reviewed it before me haven't said already so if you are reading this you must REALLY be interested in this series.The only reason I'm bothering is because I tend to write personal reviews with personal musings a habit which has cost me more than a few 'helpful' votes here and there.My purpose here (really) is to be a sort of compass for people especially newer SF fans who are just learning about the genre.If you are a member of this group then you need to ask yourself a question.

" Comes this novel given to me on Christmas by my dad on the recomendation of one of his co-workers. I am not a big science fiction fan not that I've read dozens of sci-fi books and hated them. It's just that besides what I run into in the occasional Koontz or King I have little interest in sci-fi.So after Christmas a month or so goes by and I finally open 'Foundation'. Doing research before reading this I am quite impressed at how popular this series is. After reading the book I clearly see why. The first few pages took a re-read as I was very confused. Before I knew it im onto part 2 and not able to put this book down. All I can say now is I can't wait to get my hands on the rest of the series. I was in the mood for something different than my usual reading and this really delivered. Asimov writing is intelligent yet simple. His character's aren't deep but the plot amazes. His imagination is amazing.What I especially enjoy about this book is that each of the five parts takes place many years after the previous part so you really feel as if you know the whole empire's history.All in all this book took me from not caring much for sci-fi to at the bare minimum reading the rest of this series and eventualy probably reading alot if not all of Asimov's work. A book that's on the short side never contained so much in opinion. I am now an Isaac Asimov fan. Recommended HIGHLY! ",5.0
" Foundation is a great book to read. The Foundation trilogy is a great series to read. That being said there are little elements within the story that date some of the points of reference Asimov ascribes to his characters but it's actually charming to read the references to 'atomics' etc. Asimov is a master at story-telling and this series certainly helped to cement his reputation.

" I'd like to begin this review by saying that I typically don't particularly like most science fiction. In fact I hate most of it. What Asimov did here was create an outline of continuity that seamlessly followed a logical progression displayed memorable characters that begin and end as heroic figures and never once does he insult the intelligence of the reader.The primary difference between Asimov and the Sci-Fi writers that I loathe so much is that Isaac does not stoop to create melodrama; he doesn't exaggerate his descriptions or dialogue in order to convince the reader that the heroes are great rather he let's their actions demonstrate their greatness.The only thing that does bother me about Asimov is how many terrible authors who have clearly attempted to emulate his ideas and writing style only to create abominations of thought and literature. I'm looking at you L.R.H. ",5.0

If I had to be stranded on a generational space voyage and could only bring one book this would be it.The grand scheme of this is so vast it's difficult to translate. But let's say that it encompasses a future history spanning tens of thousands of years at it's most crucial time - when the very fabric of its society is about to plunge into a dark age. Only one man can save it Hari Seldon by writing an Encyclopedia Galactica that will redirect the knowledge of mankind into a small group of scientists who can rebuild humanity in just a few thousand years.Epic in proprtion brilliant in detail this is a must read for anyone who not only savors the salt of Sci-fi literatue but anyone who just wants to read the best of the best of any genre.

" In my humble opinion this is the best Foundation book and the best overall novel that Asimov ever wrote. It's a work of genius! There are two sections of the book. The first is a seemingly typical war story of the conflict between the Galactic Empire led by a strong emporer and a firebrand general and the dumb-luck mediocre leadership of the Foundation. It illustrates how under the Seldon plan it is virtually impossible to defeat the Foundation. The second part is just phenomenal. Word spreads of a mighty mutant the Mule who is conquering the galaxy with unprecedented mental powers. The Foundation is astonished when they don't beat him;the Mule is the .001% that the Seldon plan left room for and dismissed. The Foundation falls and only a small group of hopefulls dare to go to the library of Trantor to find the Second Foundation and defeat the Mule. This book has it all;plot twists philosophy and colorful memorable characters. I highly recommend it. ",5.0

" Foundation was by far one of the best science fiction novels I have read. I especially loved his take on religion and actually making a parody of it! Through the Foundation's organized religion Asimov showed how science can possibly and really be equated with a new religion or a set of superstitions and preternatural phenomenon. Asimov also showed how religion can sway the minds of the masses as the subjucation of the Four Kingdoms illustrated. Asimov wrote his wonderful opus as a parallel of the Roman Empire and the historical allusions show. However there was something in the book that was surprisingly missing. There were no female characters! Except for the Commdora of Korell most of the figures holding real political social or economic power in this society of the future thousands of years ahead were male. I find this hard to believe. I reasoned though that because Foundation was written by Asimov in the 50s during the 'Golden Age' of SF female characters were a scarcity in most science fiction anyway. There were no female writers of SF either. Other than this glaring omission Asimov has done a brilliant job with Foundation. ",5.0
" I can see why Issaac Asimov is consider the king of science fiction. To be honest this is the first book I read by him. When I read this book I was flabbergassed that this book was written back in the early fifties. He was so ahead of his time!!! I was amazed of how much this book was mostly all dialouge usually I would of been bored if the book was mostly dialouge but the theories in this book can they be all real one day!! The thought of psychohistory should be a considered science of future and politics. Most of the books I read that are consider science fiction I feel is mostly influence by this man. I know there are more to this series but after I read this book I felt I needed much time to absorb of what I just read because it was such a mind opening experience. ",5.0

" I personally enjoyed ever word of this particular work. Many other reviewers have gone into the plot etc. so I will not do so here to any depth. This is one of those works of SiFi that will appeal to certain taste while others may find it not to their liking. There is a great deal of politics (almost Pre WWI European) involved in the story line. As the story covers (all books included) over one thousand years there are many many characters to track and keep track of. This is indeed a series of short stories all linked. I personally enjoy this sort of thing but can see where some might not. That being said it the book can certainly be regarded as a classic in this particular genre and certainly should be read by any student of such. You certainly cannot fault the author's story telling ability and imagination. I enjoyed this one a lot and do highly recommend it. ",5.0

" Unlike a lot of other sci-fi books Asimov has the ability to include not only the sense of futuristic complications and inventions he has the unrivaled ability to also include a dramatic and intense showing of personal interactions which is what makes him such a master.Its more than an idea Asimov makes it a story. Great book and possibly the best of the three foundation novels. ",5.0
" Get this book! One thing that may help is that the farsighted hero Hari Seldon sets up a plan that supposedly needs no individuals to make it work forces of humanity and all that but the stories repeatedly show the importance of individuals.

" Asimov remember wrote this initially as a series of short stories for a sci-fi magazine. Only later were the stories combined as a book. That is why of course no great character development occurs and the stories seem tidbits rather than grand scale work. Granted there is not much science in the book but I have always felt that sci-fi is a form of fiction to allow the author to write freely on a subject and be able to mask what he is really talking about. Think about it change the story to another world and have strange names for planets and suddenly nobody sees it as an attack against their country or their people. I have also felt science fiction to be more political than science (even though we call it science fiction). Politics are immense in Foundation and the style of having conversations to tell the story vs. having lots of action and space battles is fantastic. I read this first when I was 18 and did not appreciate what Asimov is trying to do. At 39 I get it. Asimov is looking at society in general and commenting that no society can be perfect and ideal and all wonderful and that dirty tricks and greed and compromise and working with others (including our enemies) is the only way a society can survive and the rest is simply propaganda. It's a direct attack against all societies that foster the idea that we're the best and the greatest and we stand for freedoms and love of country. Instead he states that what all societies become are survivors finding their strengths to counteract the enemies weaknesses. It's a great reality check which is why this should be required reading for all political science majors. ",5.0
" Asimov participated in American science fiction's golden age helping to convert pulp fantasy stories into realistic predictions of the future based on current science. It isremarkable that he wrote the Foundation while a young man barely 20 I believe a work with grand themes and the cornerstone of his massive and sprawling future history of mankind which I believe went into more than 50 volumes. The basic plot is that a scientists created a new discipline psycho-statistics I believe that could predict the future behavior of huge masses of humans. He then attempts tomold - or at least influence - man's fate over the next 30000 years. What is truly amazing is that Asimov succeeds in this and the two following volumes. In a way he should have stopped here with the series. The ideas are crisp and not yoked into a determined framework so are fresh with lively characters. Later novels in the series - the overwhelming majority - feel more stilted bound by concepts more than by a plain old good story.A sci fi classic. ",5.0
" The books in Asimov's universe are by far the best scifi to date. I enjoyed the Foundation and Robot books so much I collected all 45 books that are set in the Foundation universe written by Asimov and other authors.

Asimov is a great writer who's very prolific (He's written over 400 books! ) This is the start of his Foundation series which is a well-developed series detailing the fall of a Galactic Empire and one man's attempt to shorten the dark ages that are to come after the fall.

" I'd say that you will probably be a bit lost if you don't start with foundation and plan to continue with second foundation after this book. Reading this as a stand alone would be a bit like reading Tolkien's two towers without having started at the beginning of the series. You could probably do it and get something from the story but the beauty of the foundation series is that it is a series telling one coherent story. This book shows it's age with some of the technology it discusses but it is also vividly imaginative and full of timeless lessons. ",5.0

I am currently on second foundation the third book in the series and i am looking forward to finding out what happens next. I can't remember any other book that i've ever read that covers such a large time span in the way that this book does. Characters are introduced they play their parts and then fade into history as a new set of characters is introduced. As a fairly well read individual i would recommend these books to anyone. ",5.0
" Foundation and Empire is the second volume in Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. Originally published as two novellas Foundation and Empire the novel is made up of 'The General' and 'The Mule'.In 'The General' as the Galactic Empire crumbles General Bel Riose launches an attack on the Foundation. Although the Foundation is theoretically stronger than the Empire General Bel Riose has access to greater resources and personnel and so his attack does begin to threaten the Foundation. A Foundation citizen named Devers intercepts a communication that details the General's double dealings and attempts to escape to Trantor so that he can show the communication to the Emperor and hopefully stop the attack.'The Mule' is set roughly one hundred years after 'The General'. The Empire has crumbled Trantor has been sacked by invaders and most of the galaxy has split into barbaric factions. Due to its extensive trading routes the Foundation is now the major power in the galaxy. Until that is a new threat arises in the form of a growing army of barbarians led by a mysterious individual known as the Mule. Once it is discovered that Hari Seldon has failed to predict the existence of the Mule Foundation citizens Toran and Bayta Darell along with psychologist Ebling Mis and a refugee clown named Magnifico Giganticus travel the galaxy attempting to locate the Second Foundation that had been established by Seldon.Although a much darker and more intense book Foundation and Empire is an excellent follow up to Foundation. Asimov's writing is excellent as ever with his descriptions of the alien worlds and his characterisations being particularly strong. The whole Foundation series is fantastic and Foundation and Empire is further proof that Isaac Asimov is one of the greatest science fiction writers of all time. ",5.0
" Foundation a collection of five short stories is the first book in Isaac Asimov's epic century-spanning science fiction masterwork known as the Foundation Series.The first of the collected stories 'The Psychohistorians' takes place on Trantor the capital planet of the 12000 year old Galactic Empire. Mathematician Hari Seldon has developed a new science known as psychohistory which equates are possibilities in large societies to mathematics allowing him to predict long-term outcomes. Using his psychohistory Seldon discovers that the Galactic Empire is decaying and that it will collapse within 500 years the collapse being followed by a 300000 year period of barbarism in the galaxy. When his findings are declared to be high treason Seldon and a group of hand-picked scientists agree to go into exile on the planet Terminus where they intend to create a mammoth Encyclopaedia Galactica as the repository for all human learning. In this way they hope to limit the period of chaos that will inevitably follow the collapse of the Empire.In 'The Encyclopaedists' having progressed 50 years into the future the planet Terminus is facing its first Seldon Crisis. The Foundation on Terminus is caught in the middle of a power struggle between four neighbouring planetary systems and the scientists are ill-equipped to deal with military matters. Luckily Mayor Salvor Hardin is quick to realise the danger and attempts to work out a solution. Hardin receives guidance as to the way forward for the Foundation from an image of the now deceased Hari Seldon that appears in a specially created Time Vault and confirms that psychohistory has predicted a series of crises that will occur on Terminus.'The Mayors' takes place 30 years later when the Foundation has used its scientific knowledge as the basis for a pseudo religion that keeps neighbouring planets in order. However the Prince Regent of Anacreon seeks to overthrow the Foundation and so Salvor Hardin is once again called upon to avert a Seldon Crisis.In 'The Traders' another 55 years have passed and a trader by the name of Limmar Ponyets is sent to the planet Askone to retrieve a fellow trader who is facing execution. The leaders of Askone are determined to avoid contact with and contamination by Foundation technology so Ponyets must employ devious methods to secure the release of his colleague.The final story is 'The Merchant Princes'. The Foundation has expanded and grown powerful through the use of its science religion and economics but three Foundation vessels have recently disappeared in the vicinity of Korell a civilisation trying to develop their own variety of technical superiority. Trader Hober Mallow is sent to uncover information on their technology and hopefully find the missing ships.Foundation is clearly an epic undertaking especially since anyone who reads this first book is pretty much guaranteed to want to progress on to the further books in the series but it is well worth the effort. The Foundation Series is perhaps more esoteric that Asimov's Robot Series but is still a rewarding read. The characters planets and indeed empires that Asimov has created are truly immense and his storytelling ability is outstanding. Foundation is a fantastic book by one of the greatest science fiction writers of all time. ",5.0

" Isaac Asimov is an exception author in any genre he just happens to write in science fiction. His Foundation novels are at the apex of classic science fiction.

" Asimov's Golden Age classic Foundation Trilogy is one of the early milestones of the science fiction genre. This second installment is less episodic than the first volume focusing on just two specific stories. The first volume 'Foundation' sets up the whole idea of the Seldon Plan a mathematically based view of sociopolitical forces that enables one brilliant scientist to grow a new galactic empire from a foundation of one hundred thousand scientists and their families. 'Empire' starts off in the same vein showing how the Foundation staves off annihilation at the hands of the currently decaying but still dangerous Galactic Empire. Once again the magic of this section is the subtle means by which the Foundation overcomes impossible odds and the convincing arguments Asimov uses to make the solution seem inevitable. Part Two involves an internal struggle between the Foundation's authoritarian central government and the Independent Traders who spread that government's economic power. While the Foundation is threatened with civil war the rise of a new warlord on Kalgan poses a danger to the entire human race.Because each story is substantially longer than those in Foundation this volume focuses more on individual characters. In fact it is not too much to say that a major theme is the historical question 'Do individuals matter?' As a result the characters are developed slightly more and there's even a wistful love triangle and considerably more action than was featured in the first volume which tended to be distant and impersonal. If you liked Foundation you'll surely enjoy this and the climax to the series Second Foundation.Although these books will strike many as hopelessly dated Asimov's sweeping historical vision should not be missed by any fans of speculative fiction. They have a directness and honest charm about them that is rare in contemporary science fiction. Later additions to this series both sequels and prequels don't adhere to the tone of these original novels and really add very little except bulk. ",5.0
" If you have the patience to read the first 100 pages you'll not be able to put this book aside.The first time I read this book I was 14. I've probably read it a dozen times by now.

" I had read Foundation when I was in High School and I decided to revisit the book later. Last summer I revisited the book and by the end of the summer I had read all of the books in the series. Asimov had combined 3 series into one leading to 15(?) books. I can't remember how many I read. I even checked out the Foundation books written by 'the Killer B's.' Read this book. It is a pillar of Sci-fi as is his 'I Robot.' There is a reason that these books were in contention with Tolkien for the Sci-fi series of the century. Foundation is a wonderful starting point for an engaging series.If you decide to read the 'series.' Understand that he took 3 different series his robot series foundation series and the empire series and combined them to create a vision of future history. Few authors have tried to create a series in such a grand scale and Asimov is the master of grand scale. Only the empire series (which is currently out of print) feels outdated. Yet all parts must be read to truly enjoy the second foundation trilogy.If you want to get your feet wet with Asimov start here or with his 'I Robot.' ",5.0
" Besides his Robot stories and novels Foundation stands as oneof the greatest science fiction novel written by the late IsaacAsimov.By mixing properly the future humanity and the sociopoliticaldevelopment of our race on a galactic span using the decline ofthe Roman Empire as a base Asimov tells us a story of one man'sstruggle and the product of its stubborness in following stories.This book is a must for anyone genre fan or not I guaranteeyou will read it more than once in your lifetime.

" Isaac Asimov captivates the reader in this book the 'unofficial' start to the Foundation series. The story revolves around 3 major characters Hari Seldon a famous psychohistorian and predictor of the Empire's demise Salvor Hardin mayor of Terminus home planet of the foundation and Hober Mallow a Master Trader who rises through the ranks. I found the 3 separate yet interweaving storylines appealing much like The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury but not nearly as divided. Each character has their own opinion in how to accomplish a goal and presents each in a logical and realistic way. The thing that's amazing about the Foundation is that it doesn't have to rely on epic battles hyperdetailed sensory imagery or ridiculously long monologues by static stereotypical characters. The characters are real they get afraid they make mistakes and they change throughout the story. The writting is paced just perfectly so that it doesn't tire you out yet it provides enough details about any given situation. Asimov is a literary genius and I can't recommend the whole Foundation series enough to anyone who just has a little free time on their hands. And remember 'Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent' - Salvor Hardin ",5.0

" All I can say for warm start is that Isaac Asimov is a genius. Acclaimed Hugo Award winner he really makes you feel a part of the future as he proves to be a genius not only in a robot way of thinking but also in politics economy religion mass manipulation and of course in every way that makes a human human. And I am pretty sure this characteristic of him is really connected to his also great robotics series.Imagine yourself in the future. Now imagine yourself in a further future where you are studying the chronology of the future. Remember your history classes in school? Yeah that's where he's taking you. Analyzing the Galactic Empire from a distant and omnipotent way of view he sets a pattern in the development of mankind that repeats itself various and various times that's why this book could be written set in Middle Age. But it isn't and that's one of the most fascinating things about it.Everything starts when Hari Seldon a famous psychohistorian - a new science developed by himself based in history statistics and mathematics - predicts the fall of the Galactic Empire. To save mankind from thousands years of darkness and restart he suggests setting a new colony at the fringe of the Galaxy - Terminus System - to develop the greatest literacy work of history and regroup all knowledge ever acquired",5.0
" The Foundation Trilogy is a 'trilogy' of thirteen books. This review will mainly talk about book one. The Foundation a group of scientists and engineers writing a galactic encyclopedia starts before book one takes place. The prologue is about an apparently irrelevant person. Nonetheless I think it is important to read the beginning because it sets up the story. The main story takes place much later when the actual Foundation is formed at the edge of the galaxy. This entire group of people are the main character though at time other people take the spotlight.During the book challenges arise to meet the Foundation and at each challenge the Foundation uses a different and unique method of dealing with the task at hand. As the book progresses the Foundation gets more and more technology while the empire at the center of the galaxy dies away. The Foundation was created to start a new empire after the old empire is destroyed. To make sure this would happen Harry Seldon used psychohistory to predict the future and lock the foundation in a path that will reach its goal.I think that this book should only be absorbed by people in college or beyond because it has very advanced ideas.

" Foundation And Empire by Isaac Asimov is the second book in the original Foundation trilogy which won a Hugo Award in 1965 for Best All-Time Series. It follows much the same narrative structure as the first book Foundation save that the book has only two `books' to the original's five which allows for less epic scene setting and much more character development. And don't let some of the books' critics fool you. The characterizations in these books are wonderful deep and complex. They simply are not done in the usual ways. They use a characterization style I term `silhouetting' wherein characters are portrayed not so much by what they do as the important things they do not do or that which is not described in `on stage' actions. This book though is not merely a continuation of the first book but an expansion of its themes which includes some more detailed characterization.The first book set up the history of a senescent galactic Empire on the verge of tottering into oblivion and thirty thousand years of barbarism. A scientist named Hari Seldon attempts to shorten that Imperial interregnum by establishing two Foundations on either end of the galaxy ostensibly to compile an Encyclopedia Galactica. In reality these two Foundations will be the cornerstones of the Second Empire which Seldon's Psychohistory- a deterministic pseudoscience predicts will cut the interregnum down to s ingle millennium. By the first book's end the first Foundation on the planet Terminus has survived several `Seldon Crises' via his holographic intervention which helps the Foundation outwit its enemies and the work of legendary leaders- Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow and a few centuries in to its existence seems poised to actually take on and destroy the ruined Empire.This is where Foundation And Empire starts....the book is relatively easy to get into- even if you've not read the first book. That's because Asimov's style of the pseudo historical work allows for quick recaps (in the old movie serial vein) and the fact that each chapter within each book has new characters and situations means that they can stand alone even as they add to the overall tapestry. Asimov also makes a wise dramatic choice in The Mule section. By spending a book and a half showing Psychohistory's upside and proving its internal `validity' the second half of Foundation And Empire shows the downside of lulling oneself into a false sense of security as well the consequences that coyuld await the Foundation if it falls the same way the Empire did. The funereal descriptions of Trantor contrast vividly with the awesome complexity that opens the first book of the trilogy. Then the Empire seemed impervious. Yet Asimov is so good a writer that he rarely lapses into caricature. Even The Mule is sympathetic when we understand his drive to prove himself. Even more interesting is that he seems no worse than the old Emperors nor even the dynastic heirs of the current Foundation. With his powers his Second Empire might even be better than the Seldonian one. Yet lacking an heir- due to his sterility. and his own powers it would seem likely that even greater chaos would befall the galaxy upon his death.This begs the question that seems to be central to the trilogy",5.0
" Asimov's Foundation books are well-crafted masterfully imagined and peopled with fascinating characters. Spanning some several thousand years and multiple generations of characters (often more than one per book) the author does a fantastic job keeping each set unique and captivating. The stories follow the progression of Psychohistory a technique for predicting the future behavior of masses of people and the people set up to use its information to further the birth of a greater galactic empire. Space battles intrigue mutants telepathy and mind control as well as personal triumphs and failures run throughout all the novels.

It's touching the other person's mind.There are enough circles within circles things that aren't what they seem to be surprises that put the theories into a cocked hat to keep you on your toes.Don't deprive yourself of the best sci fi series ever written.

The only minor critique I have of this book is that as a series of novellas that continually advance into the future characters you have grown to care about are quickly whisked away and replaced by new ones. Therefore it is helpful to approach this book as a set of separate though interconnected stories. When all is said and done this book sets the stage for one of the greatest sci-fi series of all time. Complete with larger-than-life characters unforgettable twists and suprises this book is sure to satisfy any who have an interest in science fiction. Highly recommended. ",5.0

" 'Foundation' is a must. Even if your taste is for other styles Asimov's 'future history' has rightly become part of the science fiction canon of great books.The first episode in 'Foundation' appeared about 50 years ago as a stand-alone story in Astounding Science Fiction under the title 'Bridle and Saddle.' At the time Asimov had no idea where it would eventually lead. Hari Seldon Salvor Hardin and the Galactic Empire emerged in that single story to shape all the 'Foundation' novels that were to follow. It's all the more remarkable then to read that story today with the realization that none of the sequels or 'prequels' had yet been thought of.The original 'Foundation' trilogy is written in a style that may seem quaint or even prim in comparison to the baroque convolutions found in some novels of the '90s. And at the time one reviewer had trouble with the episodicity",5.0
" Although Asimov's Foundation Trilogy is over 40 years old his overall writing is still top notch. There's just something about it that draws you in and then you can't put the book down. Unfortunately many people get unhappy when they read this first book alone. Because it was written originally as a magazine serial it sometimes has a choppy format. But as a whole its superb. Only after reading all three one can appreciate the magnitude of Asimov's work. There is simply not a sci-fi trilogy anywhere that can compete. ",5.0

" This book is my favorite book. It is very well writen and it pulled me in. It wasn't quite as gripping as some other books but after I read it the first time (and every time after) I felt changed.

" Foundation and Empire is the second book in this series. If you have not read the first one yet you should. Still because of the rare and very clear writing found here you can read this book and never be confused. Since both books are so good why skip the first one?In this book we return to the future. A small empire the Foundation is on the edges of a greater one. The 'Empire' currently encompasses thousands of worlds. Still compared to its past it has been shrinking. One of its most able generals aware that the Empire is less then it once was decides to expand the Empire. Unfortunately for the Foundation he has choosen the systems occured by it as the best direction for his expansion.Like the first installation this book continually talks about the 'inevitable' victory of the Foundation. Since they are being systematically destroyed by the Empire such predictions ring hollow. How the book solves this problem seems to make sense. But this war is only the prelude for a greater conflict - a Civil War in the Foundation itself.Here is a really interesting dilemena. Since the Foundation is 'fated' to survive what will happen if it wars with itself? And to make things more interesting a third party joins the conflict. This mysterious entity the 'Mule' leads forces that beats both foundations back. What is happening here?Again like the first book in this series Foundation and Empire is as much a mystery story as science fiction. How the author solves these problems are great fun. The ending actually the middle of the book is a great surprise on your first read. What happens afterwards and the new developments make for a great twist to this story and a powerful new development in this series. A great story. It is great fun and easily as enjoyable as the first book which on its own was a classic. Read and enjoy. ",5.0
" 'The Foundation' by Isaac Asimov is a very thrilling science fiction book. This book takes place so far into the future that they do not know which planet humans came from! This book spans over 160 years and shows the developments of the Foundation. The Foundation is a group of people sent to a remote planet to preserve information and to secretly start a new empire. When the old Galactic Empire begins to crumble Hari Seldon starts the Foundation. He and his followers work on an encyclopedia to help shorten the barbarian age that results from the destruction of the empire. Seldon's true plan for the Foundation is to raise the next empire that would control the galaxy. As the book continues the Foundation grows and tries to spread their beliefs across the galaxy. Powerful neighbors become jealous and try to conquer the foundation and destroy it. The Foundation wins usually using non violent means unlike their violent foes. When the Foundation starts to conquer the other surrounding worlds they expand and send out traders. Traders hold the Foundation together and keep up the economy by trading with the inhabitants and bringing them the Foundation's beliefs. Much of the galaxy is unaware of the Foundation's secrets and the power it holds! This book is divided into five sections starting at different time periods with new characters and conflicts. The beginning of each section is difficult until you learn the new characters. However the books flows well since the ideas of people in the past sections are presented in each new section as historically important. Each section is exciting with descriptive characters and a suspenseful plot. The book is a fast read written for pure enjoyment and entertainment. It does a terrific job of both. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good book. ",5.0
" The Foundation novels of Isaac Asimov are the standard by which I judge all science fiction. The stories center around the mathmatical mechanics that allow for the prediction of the future in a statistcal manner- individual lives remain unaffected but humanity's future can be charted and directed. All this comes to pass as the great galatic empire slowly but surely fades into chaos. Only Hari Seldon creator of this science of prediction can save the universe from a galatic dark age. The short stories contained in this volume set the stage for the rich universe that the other volumes fill and explore. This is the series that testifies to the genius of it's author and is perhaps his greatest legacy. ",5.0
" The Galactic Empire is crumbling and only one man can save the universe from chaos. That man is mathematician and historian Hari Seldon. To minimize the effects of the fall of the Empire he sets up the Foundation a group of people following his carefully laid plan to preserve the achievements of humanity. So begins the reader's journey through hundreds of years of history and turmoil watching as Asimov paints his picture of the tiny Foundation and its struggle to keep Seldon's plan alive. Asimov's characters are first-rate grabbing the reader's interest with their intelligence and charisma. The plot is solid and fascinating to watch as it unfolds taking twists and turns every one guaranteed to surprise. Originally published as four short stories Foundation is the beginning of the classic science fiction epic and is not to be missed by any sci-fi fan. ",5.0
" Foundation is a must buy by writing this Asimov opened a gateway for other science fiction writers none in my opinion who have been able to better him yet. Issic Asimov doesn't just give you one set time period but 5 jumping 50 years or so into the future each one with rebelious and revolutionary characters adding colour and flavour to a already brilliant plot. If this wasn't enough and the books well worth reading for just for that you are introduced to a new kind of warfare- giving the enermy something that they want and become dependent on then when they become too mencing.... well you can read it for yourself. Foundation is pure genious you MUST read this book ",5.0
" Foundation has been called by science-fiction lovers all over the world as a cornerstone for science fiction. Isaac Asimov's all time best this book tells the tale of the crumbling of the Galactic Empire and is only the beggining of a 7-book series. The way Asimov uses the analogy of the Fall of the Roman Empire has pleased readers for decades. Asimov tells the story of a planet alone at the edge of the galaxy awaiting a future already planned for it. Leaders struggle for the planets survival for this planet Terminus holds the future of the Human Race in its hands. Isaac Asimov tells the thrilling tale of human survival in an environment that is against it. ",5.0
" It had been quite some time since I had read Asimov so I was relatively excited when I picked up Foundation. I was not disappointed in the least. This novel is an absolutely fabulous piece of psycho-political drama that is perhaps most enjoyable because of its suspenseful trill as well as its political/sociological considerations.The entire text built on the theories of the fictional character Hari Seldon is driven by the concept of psycho-history. This is primarily a form of mathematical sociology that allows for the statistical prediction of galactic masses given a set of variables. As the Galactic Empire is beginning to crumble Hari Seldon perceives this fall and takes the precautions to insure a quick return to a Second Empire. The development of his Plan spurs him to create two foundations at the ends of the galaxy to promote this return.This text chronicles the early founding and rise of the first foundation. Given the nature of psychohistory most events unfold in such a way that a critical moment at which the probability of success is nearly 100% always arrives for solutions to the problems facing the foundation. This drives the story in a suspenseful manner as Asimov pursues the interrelation of individual freedom and the 'mob psychology' of psychohistory. The text is also an interesting exploration into the rise of power by a means of a variety of factors concealed in this review for the sake of not spoiling the story.Foundation deserves the accolades of the Sci-Fi community and truly should be read by anybody who has any latent interest in science fiction or fantasy. It is an exciting and fulfilling read. ",5.0

" I first tried reading this book when I was 11. For me at the time it seemed boring at that age and I had trouble reading it. Next year I picked up the book again and couldn't stop reading it. Asimov sets up a realistic structure for how to contain millenias of combined information from across a galaxy and build a stable remote world to contain the falling Empire's scientific knowledge. But especially after reading the entire series I always must ask is psycho history scientifically possible? It states that the actions of an individual doesn't affect the flow of the universe. Later int he series though you will learn of the mule that broke this rule and even later after the trilogy where he came from. But how could mathematics and the general pschology of peoplepossibly predict when specific crisis's happen. Even though in Second Foundation where the reader learns more about the second foundation which is based not on science but on pschohistory helps maintain the course of the Foundation. You can get lost in thought trying to discover the possibilities psychohistory could bring if it could work.???? ",5.0
" It is astonishing to realize that science fiction consisted of a relative humble portion of Isaac Asimov's ouevre. While most of his time was spent on nonfiction work his contributions to science fiction proved so monumental that there is not a single science-fiction writer today who has not been influenced in some way by Asimov's writing. His intellectual and engaging fiction has produced some of the finest short stories and novels in the genre in classics such as 'The Last Question' and 'Nightfall'. But his seminal work is the top-of-the-pyramid groundbreaking and famous 'Foundation Trilogy'. He is to SF what Tolkien is for Fantasy.'Foundation' is an entertaining piece of sociopolitical SF in the backdrop of a space opera. This book is the foundation of SF for the past six decades. Asimov's prose is clear and concise without any room for ambiguity or vain style. Asimov's words though pared down and stripped of subtext are not any less true or beautiful or witty.Set thousands of years in the future after humanity has colonized millions of planets in our galaxy 'Foundation' introduces the Galactic Empire is in its waning years. One man on the capital planet of Trantor Hari Seldon predicts the cataclysmic and chaotic decline and fall of the Empire. Seldon has developed the science of psychohistory which aims to calculate the behaviour of mass populations over the course of events using among other things socioeconomic trends. Seldon has predetermined not only the demise of the Empire but that thirty millennia of barbarism will follow unless his organization the Foundation is able to finish its gargantuan mission of cataloguing and preserving all accumulated human knowledge and history. The act would serve to lessen an inevitable thirty-thousand years to a mere thousand.Asimov portrays the epic grandeur of the galaxy through the unyielding arc of time and history. Individual lives are ineffectual though not inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. Throughout the stories there is a pervading sense of `greater good' or `the bigger picture'. There is only one recurring character in each of the five tales",5.0

" Asimov's Foundation books are well-crafted masterfully imagined and peopled with fascinating characters. Spanning some several thousand years and multiple generations of characters (often more than one per book) the author does a fantastic job keeping each set unique and captivating. The stories follow the progression of Psychohistory a technique for predicting the future behavior of masses of people and the people set up to use its information to further the birth of a greater galactic empire. Space battles intrigue mutants telepathy and mind control as well as personal triumphs and failures run throughout all the novels. They are in my opinion among the best crafted series in the sci-fi genre ever produced. ",5.0
" Ah Isaac Asimov. A god some would say in the sci-fi genre. I picked up this book at the urging of a friend trusting in its reputation.At first I found Foundation unusual to read it covers large swathes of time at once. However Asimov does this extremely well. He gives us little anchors of information or characters that we can recognize so we can figure out where we are in the time line without him having to come out and say it.Much of the book is dialogue which is something I have not encountered before. Most of the story and characterization is carried in the dialogue rather than through plain description. Asimov doesn't tell you what the characters are thinking he *shows* you what they're thinking as they explain it to other characters. This rather prevents us from growing too close to the characters but that is rather the point because the time line goes so fast.Foundation was an unusual novel but I can see why it is still a classic. It may be a little dry for some but I enjoyed it. ",5.0
" When you foretell the decline of a galactic empire you don't make many friends. But Seldon manages to keep what he finds low key and sets into motion a series of events that will lessen not stop the ravages that are to come.A great sci-fi classic. One of the best from an all time master of the genre. When I was younger I tried to track down every book he ever wrote. Think I got all the Tales from the Black Widows but am not sure.Any lover of Sci-fi will find this not only exciting but intelectually stimimulating. ",5.0
" I totally liked the pattern that Isaac Asimov established in 'Foundation' the first volume in what we know refer to as the original Foundation trilogy. Hari Seldon created the revolutionary science of psychohistory and mapped out a future for humanity that would allow thirty thousand years of barbarism between the existing galactic empire and the future one to be reduced to only one thousand years. Through the effort of the psychohistorians the Foundation was established with its encyclopedists. Then we saw the rise of the Mayors the Traders and the Merchant Princes each representing a step on the path laid out with mathematical precision by Hari Seldon over the first two centuries of the millennium he plotted out.I was looking forward to a continuing series of Seldon Crises as the Foundation played out the rise of human civilization thinking that what we had hear with what Arnold Toynbee had done with his study of ancient civilizations extended into a future that covered an entire galaxy. But Asimov was setting us up for something unexpected in 'Foundation and Empire'; the idea was that at this stage the Foundation would be threatened by the final power play of the dying Empire. But the universe is apparently tired of Hari Seldon playing with his mathematically loaded dice and has thrown the entire plan into doubt by creating a mutant nicknamed 'The Mule.' Now the Foundation the Seldon Plan and the entire galaxy is facing a new and powerful threat.When I first read 'Foundation and Empire' I was rather dismayed at the big change in direction. But of course Asimov knew what he was doing. He had already proven the validity of psychohistory at least within the context of his futuristic novel and there really is no reason to put out another four books (at two hundred years apiece) to complete the plan. Historians might find this interesting but Science Fiction fans were going to want more than that from Asimov. Indeed the Mule proves to be both in terms of the story and the trilogy the link between the Foundation and the Second Foundation. The Foundation trilogy is classic science fiction from the genre's self-proclaimed Golden Age and even if the writing style seems dated or quaint it remains a seminal series. ",5.0
" But then how could it not be when its author was the incomparable Isaac Asimov? There are of course plenty of other noteworthy works by all manner of Old Masters as well as newer authors that in my opinion at least belong next to the 'Foundation' series simply because they too are great sci-fi adventures and space opera",5.0

The whole world is tilted and new ways of thinking and doing things become possible. All our world leaders need to read science fiction with its ominous ventures into possible futures. Foundation is the story of a world set up solely as place to compile an enormous encyclopedia an effort for the ages. But as the story moves forward rapidly in time we readers come to see that the world has been set up for many other secret purposes purposes designed to save the thinking peoples from an eternity in a dark age.

" Asmiov is not at all a great writer. He does not develops the characters who are often just tools to set the story going. Classic readers may find his style too crude too objective. In this series a character you find important for the story in one chapter may never appear in the rest of the saga.But Asimov is a master storyteller. His imagination has delivered us a lot of great sci-fi stories and the Foundation series is among the best.In the far future experts in the study of the behavior of great populations determine that the galactic empire is going to disappear and then they conceive a plan to preserve human civilization and reduce a many thousand years of 'dark age' to just one thousand years. They predict what is going to happen decades and centuries in the future and take precautions so that humanity will be able to avoid each crisis according to the strongest factor at each time. It seems complex but it's not. As long as you reach chapter three you're ok. I can't tell anymore without spoiling it but despite its lack of literary quality it's a story you must read if you like science fiction.I liked this book most for the outstanding way the plan comes together in each crisis revealing Asimov's amazing creative mind.I you think sci-fi silly or if you value literary virtue a great deal this is not your book. But if a great story is enough to entertain you you won't be able to put this book down. ",5.0

" I'd been hearing about Asimov's work for a while now and being a sci-fi/fnatasy fan I figured I should check it out. For me it's a matter of seeing where the genre has come from and where it's going. 'Foundation' was a quick worthwhile read which much like Tolkein helped define a genre. After reading I see why Asimov is still relevant today. His stories don't age because the lessons can still be applied to modern empires and the struggles they face.**Spoiler Alert** Do not read below here if you don't want details of the story.'Foundation' certainly didn't disappoint. At first I thought it was a little odd that the sections of the book were so far apart in time but as I kept reading it began to make sense. Asimov wasn't trying to tell a story about specific characters as we're used to thinking of them (i.e. individual people) rather he was aiming to tell the story of a civilization. As I read it began to make perfect sense. His premise is that the actions of humans as a race can be predicted on a large scale. In order to get that across the story had to be told using large scale and long time periods. Whether Asmiov was thinking of this or not I can't say. But it works. ",5.0
" Isaac Asimov didn't write about aliens or alien life it seemed. Or not very much. But he did develop a Galaxy populated by humans in this start to the series.

But there is a wild card involved in the Mule a mutant with powers to control minds and change the course of the history plotted by the scientists.

" It's kind of funny when i think that less than 3 months ago i had never heard os Isaac Asimov and i had not much interest in reading science fiction. Then i get some book called 'Foundation' for christmas and it kind of interested me although i didn't read for over a month after i had it.Well since then not only have i read it and not only have i done alot of research on Asimov and science fiction in general but i've also bought and read 'Foundation and Empire'. Quite a difference one book can make.I can not get enough of Asimov's Foundation series. I own over 100 books that i've found at thrift stores and second hand stores by many different authors. However the second day that i owned 'Foundation and Empire' i dove right into it and it did not dissapoint. The only negative thing i can say is that it's just barely not as good as the first book (although that book really blew my mind and was my very first sf novel).Regardless 'Foundation and Empire' is another solid tale by Asimov filled again with great characters (even a clown!) and written with top notch imagination and imagery. Particularly amazing is how Asimov created the character of Hari Seldon. He appears in this book for about two pages and yet the man's presence is a highlight. I did question if Asimov wasn't skilled at creating solid character's with real depth. However when a man who was only in 40 or 50 pages of the first book makes an appearance in this one it was easily my most anxious moment of the story and i truly felt just as eager as everyone else sitting before the vault for Seldon to appear. Consider my question withdrawn haha.I am really loving the Foundation series just the whole creation of the many planets the talk of ships the different classes of people everything! Not only am i very antsy about continuing this series (which i will definitely be doing soon) i am dying to read his robot novels and his stand-alones as well. Great book! ",5.0

" The big brain of Isaac Asimov composed this series and it shows. This book contains more characters than a fifteen-act Shakespearian play and still manages to unfold as one impressively coherent space-saga. This is by no means a detriment and characters as well as past events are periodically referenced in later chapters.I'm by no stretch a science fiction aficionado but upon reading summaries of the plot I couldn't wait to read this book and it verily meets my expectations. The most interesting thing about this work is that it can be read as pure-science fiction or as social-commentary/social history. Without revealing too much the sections of the book are dedicated to describing certain 'Crises' that invariably occur due to the events of an imperialistic planet - planet Terminus home-world of the Foundation - and it's attempts to reestablish (or supplant) a dying Galactic empire. The Foundation uses religion politics and economics to spread it's influence across the periphery or 'outer-edge' of the galaxy. Most of the book centers on characters who possess an aptitude for politics or are just plain cunning and it's extremely entertaining to see how each character handles the crises and mini-crises laid before them.This book is surprisingly heavy on politics - but not politics as usual...that is to say not any politics that you and I would be familiar with but politics of fictional worlds and fictional people. However the political theory behind it all is strong...I was hoping for a little more description when it came to the actual 'science-fiction' but I guess it was Asimov's intention to leave most of the work to the imagination and this actually works-out beautifully. Your imagination can truly run wild with this book - Asimov gives only the most cursory descriptions of the characters but what he gives is enough to get you going. Besides who wants to spend time reading about a character when there is a good chance that he or she will no longer exist a couple pages down the road? You can infer much of the characters content from their actions and dialogue. Foundation is an entertaining and ambitious book and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series. Classic for a reason.

" This book Foundation is a very detailed fictional book that place in the future. Isaac Asimov wrote many books and series in his lifetime and this book along with the series was one of his first books written. This story is mostly about the First Galactic Empire and its fall. Hari Seldon was a psychohistorian and using his advanced mathematics was able to conclude that the Empire would soon fall in 500 years and then be followed by 30000 years of barbarism. Hari however could limit the 30000 years to only 1000 years by having the people on a planet called Terminus follow an Encyclopedia Galactica that Hari Seldon had made. They followed this for 50 years until they found out it was a fake. Many years pass and there are many different people who try to do something to help. Each person had a crisis to get past in order to keep doing what had to be done to limit the barbarism to 1000 years. This continues until the end of the book and is then continued in the sequels. I think that this book was very interesting and I enjoyed it a lot but the only problem about it is that it is very difficult to follow because each chapter new characters are brought in and it take place 50 or more years later in time. Other than that if you are a good reader and enjoy fiction books then this is a great book to read.

" Few works of literature merit me acquiring several copies and I must say that the Foundation series is one of those.

" This is the first book of the original trilogy but the third book overall. Here's a list of all the books in the Isaac Asimov series.- Prequels -1.Prelude to Foundation (Foundation Novels)2.Forward the Foundation (Foundation Novels)- The Original Trilogy -3. Foundation4.Foundation and Empire (Foundation Novels)5.Second Foundation (Foundation Novels)- Later Works -6.Foundation's Edge (Foundation Novels)7.Foundation and EarthThere are other books written by other authors called the Second Foundation Trilogy but I haven't read those (and don't plan to).The plot centers around a psychohistorian named Hari Seldon who can predict the future using his newly invented science. He realized that the empire is failing and the galaxy will be propelled into a 30000 year stretch of barbarism before a civilized government is established. To reduce the time to a mere 1000 years he establishes two Foundations at each end of the galaxy.This book focuses on only the First Foundation the Second Foundation makes its first appearance in the sequel Foundation and Empire. The First Foundation expands to take over the edges of the receding empire using its superior intelligence instead of force. They win conflicts through technology religion and trade.The theme that reason can overcome brute force is cleverly illustrated in this science fiction classic. It's a relatively short book at 320 pages and a very fast read. The first book of the original Foundation trilogy is the beginning of a truly great series a must read for any sci-fi fan. ",5.0
" I can't say enough about this book weather you like SF or not this book is a MUST READ!!! It's more about people/civilizations/political systems than SF but either way I highly recommend it.As for SF it is simply the best SF book ever written!!!! ",5.0
" I won't bother you with much detail about the book just know that this is one of the best (if not THE BEST) Science Fiction books I have ever read. I highly recommend this book to everyone. If you plan to read only one Sci-Fi book in your entire life please make it this one! Asimov pretty much established the grounds for all space odysseys' that followed (think Star Wars Star Trek Hitchhiker's Guide etc.). You wont be let down.The book is actually a collection of 5 short stories published together in one volume. It all begins at about 30000 years after our time and about 12000 years after the Galactic Empire was established. Hari Seldon a brilliant mathematician has developed a theory (psychohistory) that can accurately foretell the behavior of immense human populations to the tee. Using it he placed the Empire's demise at 300 years with an added bonus of 30000 years of struggle in a chaotic and barbaric galaxy until the Second Empire is established.What are you waiting forget yourself a copy!!!

" Foundation is a masterpiece bar none. It is not only great science fiction but great fiction. Asimov does a truly wondrous job of painting a large picture much in the way that the Hudson School of painting did in the 19th Century while also giving compelling characterization like a Rembrandt and selecting the `right' moments that the reader can zoom in on in this compelling account of future history. Asimov leaves Clarke in the dust in terms of characterization and most of this is achieved via dialogue while still painting a big picture. Asimov wrote wonderful dialogue and one can read the tenor of a character's soul simply by how they react in words to other characters. That said I am very surprised that Asimov did not take issue with George Lucas's Star Wars films because without Foundation there would simply not be Star Wars. Everything is there to be plumbed and looted- a galactic Empire rebels space jumps to circumvent the speed of light the Galactic Spirit (aka The Force) and so on. Even Star Trek took a heavy load of its mythos from this book as the human dominated Federation and human-looking and human-derived aliens that dominate most of the Star Trek universe have much akin with the Empire that rules Foundation at novel's start....Foundation was first published in novel form in 1951 but consisted of a number of short stories published throughout the 1940s in magazines like John W. Campbell's Astounding Science Fiction. Book One The Psychohistorians was written specifically as an opening for the novel; Book Two The Encyclopedists was published as Foundation; Book Three The Mayors was published as Bridle And Saddle; Book Four The Traders was published as The Wedge; and Book Five The Merchant Princes was published as The Big And The Little. Each of the Books within the novel functions almost as an autonomus story much the way Bradbury's Martian Chronicles or Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg Ohio do. Yet it all ties together and though it has always had a reputation as a space opera even if the ultimate or original space opera it transcends that label. Yet those sorts of labels can be offputting to casual readers of a genre like I am. For I am not a sci fi nut by any means yet I sense that many people have avoided this book because like say reading a Rilke poem or watching Orson Welles' Citizen Kane they have felt that something so overpraised and hyped is bound to be a letdown. It's not. It earns its praise and labels like epic for even though the book is less than 150 pages long in my version probably 250-300 pages in paperback it is certainly epic- the timescales and range of the Empire demand nothing less. And although that term is grossly overused in this case it is spot on. The very title of the book has in the decades since its first appearance taken on another connotation though- that of not only referring to the Foundation within the tale but its place as the Foundation upon which modern outer space sci fi is based upon.This is not to deny the books flaws which are there. But given that most of them have to do with technological things they are not truly literary flaws merely those of the nature of the sci fi genre. Among them are anachronisms such as typical hausfrau-like portrayals of women who apparently still worry over household domestic products an addiction to nicotine an over-reliance on atomic power the use of parsecs rather than light years as a unit of distance the galactic Empire being at the center of the galaxy where we now know only a supermassive black hole exists and makes life as we know it untenable due to radiation and other minor points. Other flaws are less anachronistic than what in film would be called continuity errors such as being able to transcend the speed of light but recording information in actual books and on microfilm rather than digitally or quantumly yet being able to teleport that information; the Empire possessing holographic technology yet it all being powered by vacuum tubes; or civilizations possessing interstellar ships but having economies dependent on fossil fuels- which means that dinosaurs and the like must have appeared on millions of the other worlds. Then there are just the plain odd things such as Asimov's faith in capitalism being the solution to the galactic ills even though in his universe it's what ails all the worlds. The idea that even were an Empire to arise and dominate a galaxy that such a massive thing could ever stagnate seems odd. Diversity argues against that but this shows Asimov's pessimism regarding the human ability to evolve. That these future men also have life spans akin to ours smoke and suffer cancer bespeaking there seems to have been little in the way of medical breakthroughs (this was pre DNA discovery) also seems a bit of an imaginative lack.But perhaps the greatest flaw of the book is Asimov's love affair with the Freudian Psychohistory (although I'm told in later books Asimov redacted the mythos to reveal it all a fraud) which reeks of determinism exalts psychology to a `hard' science damns free will plays to the Fallacy Of Uninterrupted Trends and has been totally demolished in the wake of chaos theory. Still even though Psychohistory fails as science it's still far easier for a writer to predict human nature than scientific advances.But again these are mere quibbles relatively speaking. Let me look at the pro side of the ledger. The very Psychohistory that in reality is specious allows for the very drama of the tale to exist. While poor science it makes for excellent drama. To watch the various Foundation leaders grapple with their own will versus their faith in Seldon is the essence of existentialism. Asimov's use off offstage action is not just a condensing device but clues the reader in to what is really important- the human moments and confrontations not the comic book like blowing up of great interstellar vessels. A third device that works well is the use of select epigraphs throughout the story culled from the fictive Encyclopedia Galactica. They unify the tale lend it grandeur and ground this future history as if it were already in the reader's past much as Edward Gibbons' real and influential The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire did and which Asimov acknowledged as his main source of ideas. Wisely there is not too much technobabble which helps date a work more than anything else. Also as stated before the book is rife with humor and sparkling dialogue as well as plausible catchphrases like `Galaxy knows' or `By galaxy!' It is also worth re-stressing that the book's focus is not on scientific progress but social progress and this predicates a number of major existential queries such as what is progress? How does progress reconcile with human nature? Is progress ever expanding cyclical or helical? What is knowledge? How do the two square? Should knowledge be commoditized? Should knowledge be mysticized? What is free will and ethical agency? But most of all how can all these subjects and ideas be best related?Yet most of all despite the ideas and the narrative is the wonderful fact that Asimov is just flat-out a damned good writer. His prose is sometimes muscular sometimes poetic but always lucid and clear. His plots are not overly Byzantine yet quite complex his sentence and paragraph structure not ornate but subtly seductive. How Hollywood has never optioned this book for a film is beyond me. Wait no it's not. Why would they want to do compelling human-based science fiction when they can pump out the pseudo-intellectualism of a Philip K. Dick or the vapid ur-mythography of Star Wars and make a fortune? Perhaps Asimov might be re-thinking his faith in Adam Smith's invisible hand in the great beyond? ",5.0
" The main plot of the story copies the evolution of every human society. The decline and fall of empires followed by the rise of others depends on the same phenomena as those described here. We are puzzled by Psychohistory but the notion itself (forecasting the future as the weather) is sound. This novel opens a range of questions and issues beyond other books of the genre. ",5.0
" Isaac Asimov considered his work that eventually became the Foundation and Empire book of The Foundation Trilogy to be his best due to his introduction of the misunderstood mutant conqueror",5.0
" Once again Asimov serves up a thrilling read for the sci-fi fan. The two story-lines followed in the text pertain particularly to the question of if/how spectacular individuals can alter the Plan of Hari Seldon. The first pertains to a final thrust of the Empire while the second pertains to the question of an anomalous power known as the Mule.The final expeditions of the Empire attempt to take over the foundation by means of the talented general Bel Riose. Bel Riose launches a campaign against the Foundation and pushes toward victory with nearly unprecedented ease backed by the Imperium. This first half of the book considers the power of the individual and the mass with respect to the great movements within the Foundation according to the Plan. Although I will not reveal much more than this I will at least say that the outcome of part one is intriguing in comparison to part two dealing with the Mule.The second half of the story deals with the relationship of Seldon's plan to the possibility of a mutation which begets a figure who is an extremely powerful galactic conqueror destroying the overall political milieu foresaw by Seldon. To speak much more of this would spoil the read for you. However I must say that it is a thrilling text which kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through the end. The ending itself was such a surprise that it indeed reminded me that I was reading Asimov for it is just the type of intellectual curve-ball that he would throw just as the novel ends.Once again we have a stupendous text on our hands in these two. It raises major questions about the plausibility of psycho-history some of which are raised again in the third text in the series. I suggest this text most thoroughly to all sci-fi fans. I only suggest that you at least read Foundation before reading this book. ",5.0
" But Asimov is one of the greatest science-fiction authors to have every lived. His massive work adding itself to works by other such sci-fi masters",5.0
" This book is amazing science fiction novel. Asimov's straightforward and simple way of writing presents the reader with a concise and well formed novel. The plot is amazing with its many twists and turns although the character development isn't very strong. However the lack in character development comes from Asimov's style of writing in which he presents the reader with several major characters. The entire book revolves around foreshadowing of a point in history where knowledge will be lost and barbarians will rule over an ingorant civilization. In order to shroten the period of ignorance and barbarianism Hari Seldon forms the Foundation a group of scholars on a planet at the edge of the galaxy. Asimov uses foreshadwing to great effect throughout the entire novel to form the plot. Another device well used by asimov is symbolism. One example is the Foundation which is used as a symbol for hope for the future. The symbols placed throughout the novel bring about a sense of profound revelation to the reader. Irony is also used very effectively in one instance. When the encyclopedists realize that all their work was all in vain Asimov reveals the fragility of the human intellect. He explains how the composition of human knowledge is not in one single person but is spread out throughout all of humanity and cannot be contained within one book or one set of books. ",5.0
" The trilogy is essential but since Asimov also capitalized on his own genius by writing what seems to be hundreds of lesser Foundation stories it can all get very confusing and a bit draining. This is the second book in the original trilogy so it is from a science fiction point of view essential reading. The trilogy itself comes up with two highly memorable characters Hari Seldon the psycho-historian who uses Mathematics to predict the future and establish a 'Foundation' that will limit the dark ages after the fall of the 'Empire' to a single millenium (as opposed to ten.) He reappears as a hologram at certain points in the story with more or less accurate takes on what is happening in 'History' at that point.The other very memorable character is the Mule. He represents the variable that makes predicting 'History' mathematically a tricky business at least not to mention impossible. He is a nasty totalitarian character who strangely in Asimov's hands manages to elicit some sympathy. Asimov is playing with the idea of predicting human behavior scientifically (or controlling it scientifically) but this character is also a humanistic meditation on how masses of people get overwhelmed by evil social forces like fascism and soviet communism. You can see that Asimov lived through the era of Hitler Mussolini Franco and Stalin and that these cult of personality tyrants and the submission of masses of people to their destructive and sadistic wills profoundly affected his view of human nature. Foundation and Empire seems to be an attempt to come to terms with that experience and so has something to say about the specifics of twentieth century history as well as about historical philosophy.

" The Foundation trilogy (three first books) and the Foundation series (all seven) are often regarded as the greatest set of Science Fiction literature ever produced. The Foundation series won the one-time Hugo Award for 'Best All-Time Series' in 1966. Isaac Asimov was among the world's best authors an accomplished scientist and he was also a genius with an IQ above 170 and it shows in the intelligently concocted but complex plots and narrative. There are already 331 reviews for this Science Fiction novel however I still believe I have something unqiue to contribute which is stated in my last paragraph.This book and the rest in the series take place far in the future (allegedly 50000 years) at a time when people live throughout the Galaxy. A mathematician Hari Seldon has developed a new branch of mathematics known as psychohistory. Using the law of mass action it can roughly predict the future on a large scale. Hari Seldon predicts the demise of the Galactic Empire and creates a plan to save the knowledge of the human race in a huge encyclopedia and also to shorten the barbaric period expected to follow the demise from 30000 years to 1000 years. A select people are chosen to write the Encyclopedia and to unknowingly carry out the plan to re-create the Galactic Empire. What unfolds in this book and in the books that follow is the future history of the demise and re-emergence of a Galactic Empire written as a series of adventures in a similar fashion to the Star Wars series.Even though this is arguably the greatest set of Science Fiction novels ever written I do not recommend it to those who are only mildly interested in Science Fiction. Character development is not the focus of these novels and the large amount of technical/scientific details schemes and plots can become both confusing and heavy for the unitiated Science Fiction reader. If you read this one you will feel the need to read the others which may take a long time. If you are new to Science Fiction start with something lighter and when you are hooked you can continue with this series. Also in my opinion the second and third books were better than the first.

" The Foundation Trilogy is my favorite sci-fi book series and also my favorite work by asimov. The first book in the series Foundation is concerned primarily with two concepts. The first is the concept that history repeats itself over and over again and that just as great empires fell in the past the same problems will in the future aflict empires once they become too big. And naturally after the fall of a great empire chaos ensues. The other concept this book describes is the theory that science and mathematics are capable of predicting the trends in complex systems such as large groups of people.I am going to be honest. This book was revolutionary for its time and a great many famous sci-fi writers were inspired after reading this book. I know that I personally could never look at world governments the same way after reading this book. It truly opens your eyes to tendancy of people to make the same mistakes over and over again repeating the same patterns on a large scale. And not only is this book easy to read and greatly thought-provoking it is also great fun. It uses Asimov's trademark style. Little violence even less sex but a great plot and lots of cool technology. If you take science fiction at all seriously you owe it to your self to give this book a read. ",5.0

" OK I admit it. I am totally incapable of writing an unbiased objective review of this book just as I am unable to say unbiased objective things about my first girl friend. This was the first SF novel that I read (actually I bought it for a friend and then read it before I gave it to him -- the beginning of a life-long nasty habit) when I was 14.The scope of the story is breathtaking the pace is good -- especially for Asimov who tended to be pretty wordy -- and the details engaging. Asimov wrote this as a series of connected stories for 'Astounding' magazine and this shows in the oddly repeated facts that allowed the 'zine readers to follow the plot even when they missed earlier stories. It also adds a certain pulpy flavor to the text which I think works well. SF about grand civilizations that are galactic in scope doesn't need to -- and probably shouldn't -- sound like Great Fiction. I think the gritty quick style of Asimov's pulp writing works well.One of my favorite things about the whole 'Foundation' series (you need to real all three of the originals by the way the newer ones are optional) is the way they presaged certain now-routine SF conventions. The most notable of course is the globe-encovering city/planet of Trantor most recently replicated by George Lucas in 'Star Wars",5.0

" This is the first published volume (which was originally published as four short stories in 'Astounding Science Fiction' magazine 1942-1944 with an introductory section written in 1949) of Asimov's famous trilogy which affected many later works. This trilogy which won a special Hugo Award in 1966 for the best science fiction series of all time was later expanded into further volumes by Asimov (in fact two prequels are Asimov's 'Prelude to Foundation' and 'Forward the Foundation'; after Asimov's death in 1992 other authors [for example Gregory Benford's 'Foundation's Fear' Greg Bear's 'Foundation and Chaos' and David Brin's 'Foundation's Triumph'] have contributed to the series [note that there are now five novels that serve as prequels to Asimov's first published Foundation book!]) . In these stories spacecraft travel over large distances via 'jumps.' The ships spend most of their time in a form of hyperspace each jump being aimed at a certain target star. The central character Hari Seldon is a psychohistorian. Psychohistory is the mathematics dealing with the reactions of very large masses of mankind to social and economic stimuli (and the recent advances in chaos theory in advanced mathematics lends credibility to Asimov's psychohistory). His calculations predicts an end to the Galactic Empire (an empire remarkably similar to the Roman Empire on Earth). Two Foundations are set up to ease mankind through the dark area predicted (or else the dark period will last 30000 years) and after a thousand years will join together to form a second Empire. Although Asimov's early writing style leaves much to be desired (recall this was all put together in his early 20s during World War II when he worked for the U. S. Navy and when he was finishing his graduate work at Columbia Univ.) it is still fun reading; I enjoy every time I reread it. It is particularly enjoyable in the context of the other volumes. This first published volume has five parts. In 'The Psychohistorians' an introductory tale (which begins about 46 years after the events described in 'Prelude to Foundation' and thirteen years after the events described in the last story of 'Forward the Foundation') Dr. Hari Seldon and a young colleague are arrested on the planet Trantor (the governing center of the Galactic Empire) and tried for treason. Seldon's group are to be exiled to the planet Terminus on the galactic rim where they will form a scientific refuge. Seldon also plans to set up another group somewhere else. We later learn in Part III that this other group (the Second Foundation) is located at a place known as Star's End at the other end of the galaxy. In 'The Encyclopedists' taking place about fifty years later a large number of members of the original Foundation are on the planet Terminus and are compiling a massive encyclopedia to prepare for the upcoming dark age. But why were no psychobiologists and only one psychologist present among the original colonists? The remaining three parts continue the development of the Foundation on Terminus. ",5.0

" Originally written in the 1950's for serial publication the Foundation Trilogy (and the additional books written in the series) is often hailed as Asimov's greatest achievement. Certainly the original trilogy is high on my list of 'must read' science fiction.The Foundation Trilogy presents us with a universe controlled by the Galactic Empire. The Empire has governed the known universe for tens of thousands of years and appears to be at the zenith of its power. But the Empire is burdened by the weight of the bureaucracy needed to govern millions of worlds. Trantor the administrative seat of the Empire is a planet completely covered by buildings. A vast planet-wide city it houses the millions of functionaries necessary to administer the Empire. As wealthy and as powerful as the Empire seems disaster is just around the corner. However only one man Hari Seldon is able to recognize the Empire's impending doom.Hari is a mathematician who has developed the breakthrough field of Psychohistory. Psychohistory is the mathematical process by which the actions of people can be predicted in advance. This science does not work for predicting individual behavior but instead predicts the behavior of a mass of humanity (billions of people). By analyzing the Empire with Psychohistorical methods Hari has determined that the Empire will crumble within 500 years plunging the known universe into barbarism that will prevent a new Empire from arising for 30000 years!Fortunately Hari has developed a plan that if executed will curtail the period of galactic decay to a mere 1000 years. However it is unclear whether Hari can persuade the Emperor to allow him to move forward with his plan. Can Hari and his fellow scientists save the universe? Or will the shortsighted aims of a greedy grasping Emperor derail their plans?Although these works are science fiction they would probably not be classed as 'hard' science fiction. There is some necessary discussion of scientific principles but not enough to bore any 'technophobes' who may be reading the novels. The trilogy focuses mainly on the people involved in the Seldon plan as opposed to the technology being used by them. Asimov always enjoyed speculating on how people would evolve and react to advanced technology and he lets his imagination run wild here.Two significant milestones were achieved with this work. First Asimov became one of the first writers to theorize that atomic power would revolutionize society. Second I believe Asimov was the first to present a planet that was entirely covered by buildings. The universe he creates is engaging and filled with fascinating believable characters. Since the books were serialized many chapters (especially in the first volume) contain complete plot lines and make the book easy to read if you need to break up your reading time into small increments. Lots of political intrigue and maneuvering keeps the action flowing through all three books.Foundation sets the stage for the rest of the series. Hari Seldon is introduced and his theories of Psychohistory are explained. Then Seldon's Foundation is established on Terminus a remote planet at the edge of the Empire with the goal of shortening the period of barbarism the universe will experience. However there are no Psychohistorians located in the Foundation... only scientists. The planet has very few native metals and virtually no defenses. The scientists must figure out how to rule their world and fend off avaricious neighbors as the Empire begins to crumble. The majority of this first volume contains vignettes chronicling the Foundation leaders responding to various crises that Hari Seldon predicted centuries before. The crises are varied and plausible. The solutions to the problems that arise are not solved by any miraculous means but by tough clever political maneuvering. Watching the crises and their solutions unfold is very enthralling and keeps you turning the pages at a rapid pace.There is something here for everyone to enjoy. If you have never read this fine trilogy buy a copy today. You won't be disappointed. ",5.0
" Isaac Asimov has always been a better science writer than a science fiction writer. He does not have the turn of phrase the poetic endownment the ability to have characters change and grow and become interesting...but his ideas have always been cutting edge without being over the top.The vision of the breakdown of the future empire of Hari Seldon and the school of psychohistory the idea of setting up two Foundations at each end of the galaxy...great elements of a story. There has been talk that Asimov 'borrowed' these ideas from Campbell but if so he gave them a polish and a new direction that completely transformed the otiginal ones.One must grant literary historical and scientific license to the writer in that many of the inventions we take for granted were only glimmers in the eye of a teenager in the 50's. The ideas are stunning in scope if not in execution. I would have loved to have seen a Heinlein or Pamela Sargent with this material. Still it retains the reader throughout...and sets up the next novel in the trilogy. ",5.0
" I first read the Foundation series many years ago and made the mistake of loaning the books to a friend - of course I never got them back. Recently I decided to buy the series again and once again I was amazed with how ahead of their time they were considering how long ago they were written. The central premise of the story is imaginitive and the plot devices by which Asimov drives the book forward are cleverly thought out.I'm not a fan of 'laser guns and spaceships' science fiction and I hold to the idea that people living hundreds of years from now will fundamentally be the same as us. We won't be wearing silver suits and living on a diet of vitamin pills. So it's refreshing to read a 'sci-fi' story that doesn't get bogged down with high-tech stuff but focusses on human development. I'd recommend it to any one whether you're a sci-fi geek or not. ",5.0

" Foundation is set about 12000 years in the future where the weakening grip of the galactic empire is showing strong signs of decline.Enter Hari Seldon key figure in the book whom as per his psycho-historical mathematics claims to bring 30000 years of barbarism down to a mere 1000 by setting up two foundations at the opposite ends of the galaxy. The story about the first Foundation follows and here asimov attacks typical sociological issues and how the infant society deals with them.It is more of a series of well-connected snapshots over several decades rather than a contiguos moving story/time line. The only weakness of the book if you want to call it that is the lack of good character development... but it doesnt impede the reader from following the twists and turns of the plot.Foundation is the first book in what is perhaps Sci-Fi's most imaginative and complete series by Issac Asimov. It's almost a sin to not finish the series which include (in order)foundation and empiresecond foundationfoundation's edgefoundation and earth <-- best book of the seriesTo get most thrill out of the series i highly recommend reading the robot series (the caves of steel the naked sun the robots of dawn robots and empire) before moving on to foundation's edge and foundation and earth.

" This book has flaws yes as some of the earlier reviewers have pointed out but they are seriously missing the point if they give the book fewer than 2 stars. Asimov was a man of great ideas and scientific knowledge but I do not believe that he ever took a creative writing class. He was writing back in the days when a writer wrote rather than talked about writing. So OK some of the characters talk as though they are in a cowboy movie. So OK some of the dialogic phrasings are awkward or stilted. So OK there is only one teeny tiny female character (as a black man myself I might aslo point out that we of the African Diaspora are noticeably absent from the futuristic roll call). The whole idea of psychohistory is so engaging that you sit there for hours pondering it and thinking and he was so young when he wrote this. So young. This is a great book a true classic. ",5.0
" This book along with Frank Herbert's Dune are the two cornerstones of science fiction. Many subsequent writers owe a debt to Foundation which is best read within the original trilogy (Foundation Foundation and Empire Second Foundation. It is extremely exciting for anyone with a sense of the 'epic' questions of the fate of mankind or for that matter any large society or culture. A staggering achievement.It is hard to get to the end of this work and not want to pick up Foundation and Empire.Now I might add that I did not personally enjoy very much the subsequent 'interference' with the books created by the subsequent novels - Foundations Edge Foundation and Earth and Prelude to Foundation. I think Asimov's idea for the story changed as he got older (certainly the 'robot' angle is increasingly emphasised which I think is to the general detriment of the series) and while I have not read much literary criticism on this topic I would suggest the original idea was better.

" I first read these books when I was in high school and althoughI almost never read fiction and don't particularly like sciencefiction (even though I studied geophysics in university andwork as an engineer) these books made an immense impressionon me. As I began to study Judaism I finally discovered thatAsimov a non-observant yet knowledgable Jew was using theformat of science fiction to describe the Jewish concept of theredemption of mankind. A careful reading of the BiblicalProphets shows that the ideal world that history is leadingmankind towards has universal peace between nations and ade-emphasis of technology in favor of the development of man'sinner morespiritual side. However this development of man's spiritualqualities and move towards universal harmony is accompaniedby upheavels and wars. Jewish tradition also says that theworld is sustained by 36 'hidden' righteous people whosegood deeds and spritual superiority are vital from preventingthe destructive forces in the world both natural andman-made from overcoming everything and leading the worldto chaos.Asimov used the two Foundations as his vehicle for describingthis cosmic process and an important part of the story isthe necessity of the Second Foundation to remain 'hidden' toallow the process to work itself out.As far as the story itself is concerned it is true that it isdated...for example Asimov places the capital of the GalacticEmpire on the planet Trantor which 'is at the center of theGalaxy'. Today it is believed that the center of the galaxyis full of black holes and lethal amounts of radiation so itis unlikely there would be life as we know it there. AlsoAsimov posits atomic energy as being the ultimate form of powerbut physics has advanced beyond that point to fusion and otherexotic forms of power.On the other hand Asimov wrote these stories in the wake ofthe Second World War and so he is quite aware of how so manyinstitutions created by men...including governments and religiousestablishments even starting with the bestof intentions seems to run into crises. Thus the GalacticEmpire which brought centuries of peace and prosperity tomankind is brought inevitably to a point of degeneration andhow the (First) Foundation itself founded by idealisticintelligent people who are at least partly aware of theirimportant role in shaping a better future for mankind rapidlydegenerates into a repressive dictatorship.As others have pointed out these stories have almost no 'action'which is fine with me (my favorite movies and TV shows alsohave no action e.g. Twelve Angry Men) and in spite of thefact that these stories are 60 years old I recommend themto anyone who wants a deeper look at mankind's natureand its destiny.

" Asimov was one of the incredible path-breakers for science fiction and the Foundation books are thought by many to make up one of the best and most far-reaching series of the entire genre. While Asimov was a biochemist by trade he certainly understood the circular pattern of human history regardless of the amount of technology available to mankind.Foundation is about the fall of the Galactic Empire that has ruled for times immemorial (so long in fact that the memory of the legendary 'Earth' is but a myth). The Empire's fall will obviously result in much chaos as the wheels of law struggle to beat back the inevitable barbarians who rise to loot and pillage (rather than rebuild) the riches of the old Empire. All of this seems a rather bleak future for humanity yet Asimov is a hopeless optimist (at least in my eyes) in that he sees the resilience of people as ever reaching. The Foundation series is therefore a group of novels about the ways in which humanity restores itself even after all seems lost.'Foundation' the first novel in the series focuses on a colony formed by one who foresees the destruction of the Empire a man named Hari Seldon. Seldon therefore attempts to minimize the effects of the collapse by building a community made up of intellectuals called the 'Foundation'. The book is divided into three separate stories at completely different times in the history of Seldon's paradise one at the formation of the Foundation another at its troublesome infancy and the last at the time that the Foundation becomes economically independent (it becomes internally capitalistic and externally somewhat imperialistic). Each story rather stands alone and while the last is somewhat disappointing each is worthy in its own right.Highly recommended; if you don't read this book you can't understand science fiction as a genre.

" Hari seldom the man who predicted the fall of the empire in the first book established foundations on each end of the galaxy to prevent the rise of a dark age. The fallen empire from the first part of the book has incresed it's strength and with that strength it plans to seize control of the foundation. With an ambitious and skilled general and dozens of battle fleets the foundation faces it's greatest enemy.Personally I liked the second part with the mule better then the war with the empire because the main characters have nothing to do with the foundations victory which makes the plot not a major factor for the story but this also leads the reader into more surprises for the end of the section.'I am the mule'. As the reader discovers the identity of the speaker all loose ends are tied up while creating a great twist for the end. Even though Seldon's predictions guide the foundation to overcome the first four crises this is the book where his predictions turn the foundation into a disaster. A mutant is born having the power to fight against any great power of the galaxy a man that is able to defeat dozens of battle fleets with the intelligence greater then any scientist of the foundation. .The second part of the book is full of surprises so please finish the book if you have started it or you might miss one of the best plots in science ficiton. While reading the story of the two couple's adventures the reader needs to think deeply in their every move. Isaac lets the reader feel the negative consequences in prediction. The more hope the foundation has on Hari Seldon's prediction the greater fall they will need to suffer. Although the plot of the couple's is resolved the foundations destiny is discovered in the third book the second foundation. I believe any reader that has read this book will definitely also need to read the second foundation so I recommend buying both books. ",5.0
" This is truly a defining book for the genre of science fiction. The beauty of this tale is that Asimov began penning it when he was only twenty one years old. The story centers around a falling empire and the many characters throughout its history that define it. It also deals with a sort of scientific prophecy in what is termed 'psychohistory'. This is the manner in which the future can be predicted using scientific evidence and the laws of probability. This is truly a masterpiece of the genre. A standard which all sci-fi authors should hope to attain. I would recommend this read to anyone that is a science fiction fan. Many readers are familiar with Orson Scott Card. This is the novel which prompted him to become a writer. That this novel is a cornerstone in the genre is an understatment. ",5.0
" This was the first book I have read by Isaac asimov and I can say it was worth the wait. While this book is very old it is still an excellent read. Asimov presents a very convincing future for humanity. The book is broken into several sections that were originally short stories in a sci-fi magazine. They gel togethor perfectly and the overall story is wonderful. This book details Hari Seldon and his prediction of the fall the galactic empire and the rise of barbarism for 30000 years. He however thinks he can avert the disaster and only have 3000 years of barbarism in the galaxy. Based on this he sets up two seperate foundations that are supposed so achieve this goal. This book is focused on the first foundation and it's trials as the fall of the galactic empire begins.THe characters in this book are good. While each section is short you really empathize with the characters and their lives. The plot is excellent some of the suprises he throws at you are quite extrodinary. My only complaint is some the terminology in this book is quite old and often times is quite funny to read. However the ideas characters and plot make up for the archaic wording in the book.I would recommend this book to any science fiction fan! ",5.0
" The story of Foundation continues in F&E; with the stories in this book taking us through the final fall of the old Galactic Empire and the power vacuum left in its wake. The most known aspect of the second book however is the idea that psychohistory is limited in that it is not able to predict aspects caused by wild chance-- and in this second Foundation book wild chance threatens Foundation in the person of a powerful mutant called the Mule.Well-written as Asimov always is.

" I can't believe this is finally coming to DVD!Three's Company has always been my 'all time' favorite show.I never get sick of watching John Ritter's extraordinary talent.I just hope the other seasons are released quickly.There are quite a few and I want them all! ",5.0

" Growing up I loved watching re-runs of Three's Company on TV. I think it's re-run about as long as I Love Lucy. I wasn't sure at first if I wanted to collect this series now that I had opened it up as a very lovely Christmas gift I'm a die hard fan of the series. Ever since John Ritter has passed away I've missed him very deeply possibly more than any celebrity that's passed away. Now I have a wonderful starter collection to remember him by. The quality of the DVD is totally amazing! It's one of the best that I've had besides The Mary Tyler Moore season one set. At first I've always been surprised that the first season was on one DVD. When I did some research I realized it was a starter or a test season. I love all the episodes on this set",5.0
" This package contains all six episodes from the first season of ABC's hit sitcom THREE'S COMPANY. It premiered on March 151977 starring the late John Ritter as Jack Trippera young handsome aspiring chef who was then studying the culinary arts. Joyce DeWitt is Janet Wooda brunette beauty who works in a flower shop and Suzanne Somers as blonde beauty Chrissy Snow who immediately interests Jack in many ways. Supporting cast members are the late Audra Lindley as Helen Roper and the late Norman Fell as Helen's husband Stanley. Stanley and Helen are the trio's landlords. In the first episodeJack is asleep in the bathtub following a drinking binge from a party given by Janet and Chrissy the previous evening. The party was for EleanorJack's predecessor in apartment 201. Eleanor had gotten married and given birth to a seven-pound and nine-ounce baby boy. So after Jack cooks a delicious breakfast for Janet and Chrissythey invite him to be their new roommate. When Jack introduces himself to the Roperswho live directly below the triohe tells them he's moving in. But Stanley strongly denies until Janet told him Jack was gay(Stanley could never fathom a straight male platonically living with two straight women). In episode #2Jack arrives with his belongings via taxicab from the YMCA where he previously residedto apartment 201. He rings the bellbut instead of a chime he hears Stanley reacting to the electricity immersing in him as he was fixing the doorbell. Chrissy's mother came to L.A. for a dentist's appointment and planned to stay at the apartment. She sleeps in what would become Jack's bedroom and Jack sleeps on the couch(Jack would do that whenever there were house guests). In episode #3it's Chrissy's birthday and the trio would celebrate amongst themselves. Stanley's young beautiful niece Karen is staying with the Ropers and Stanley pays Jack $50 to take her out despite Stanley believes Jack is gay. Jack promised the date would only last 20 minutes and he would come back home in time for the birthday celebration. Janet and Chrissy are furious with Jack. On the dateJack who drives Stanley's carhad some trouble with it. It overheated on the freeway. He uses the $50 to reclaim the cameo Janet had hocked a while back for rent money. Jack and Karen are kissing in the Ropers' apartment and when the Ropers awakeStanley catches Jack and Karen and immediately evicts him from apartment 201('He was acting normalthat's sick!'). The eviction is cancelled after Karenaccording to Stanleypractically attacked Jack and he showed no interest. In episode #4Jack brings home a puppyunaware that pets are forbidden in the apartment. Richard Kline as Larry Dallasmakes his first appearance on the show. Jack owed Larry $25 and Jack took the puppy to cancel the debt. Larry would later become Jack's best friend and the trio's upstairs neighbor. The trio parents the dog until Helen takes it in. A sleepwalking Chrissy planted the dog on the Ropers' doorstep. Helen declares the dog an anniversary present from Stanley. In episode #5the trio redecorate the apartment and take a break to go to the neighborhood pubthe Regal Beaglefirst seen in episode #2. Thereat the bar are two guys and one of them takes interest in Chrissy. Chrissy feels harassed by the guy. He overhears Jack telling Janet and Chrissy that men are naturally stronger than women. Hethe 'creep'finds a 'man' in the jointStanley. The 'creep' accidentally spills Stanley's brandy and asks the bartender to give Stanley another one. Later Jack finally gets tough with the creep and for his(Jack's) so-called heroismis given an on-the-house shot of whiskey. The creep harassed both Janet and Chrissy. In episode #6Janet and Chrissy are out $300 in back rent money. Thinking the money was stolenthey call the police. Jack tries to get $300 from the financial aid department at his college and is denied. Janet and Chrissy don't realize until the endthat they had already paid the rent. Stanley naturally took the moneyin an envelope with the word 'rent' on it while doing a repair job. But he failed to leave a receipt indicating he received the payment(the tenant's/s' copy was still attached to his receipt book!). ",5.0
" Yes Three's Company is the greatest show because of John Ritter's brilliance. All the seasons were great but 6 7 and 8 were easily the best because Chrissy was gone and completely forgotten and the show could now focus on the power of Jack Tripper. Sure Chrissy was a fine credit to the core of the show but as she became dumber she became more of a hindrance than a support to Jack. Terri on the other hand became the perfect complement to Jack not to mention the fact that she was also much hotter than Chrissy. And of course Janet had always achieved a wonderful dynamic with Jack throughout all the seasons. The last 3 seasons not only showcased John Ritter's unbelievable physicality in greater amounts but the actual content of the show focused on Jack's life. In other words the whole premise of a guy living with 2 girls was virtually worn out and extinct. As a result the content became broader and the show became much funnier. But all of the credit for this improvement is bestowed to John Ritter. This indeed was John Ritter's show and the show would not have had anywhere near the amount of appeal with some other actor. The first season unfortunately does not showcase John Ritter but revolves around the 3 roommates. Nevertheless just his presence is electrifying and his magnificence envelops you. Celebrate the Greatest Show by the Greatest Man through this DVD! ",5.0
" Bursting onto the television landscape in Spring 1977 Three's Company quickly skyrocketed in the ratings - cracking the top 8 every season except its last. Sporting a plethora of quirky characters and fresh writing talent that explored modern day issues the show held its own as one of the funniest programs on TV. Picking up where All In The Family left off Three's Company delved into the social taboos of its day dealing with subjects such as homosexuality racism sexual harassment and of course unmarried men and women living together... But the true success of Three's Company stemmed from the comic talents of John Ritter and Suzanne Somers who became instant stars as a result of their respective roles on the show...In Three's Company John Ritter plays the role of Jack Tripper a young cooking student in San Diego who wants to move into an apartment with his two female friends - the far more mature Janet Wood (Joyce DeWitt) and the blonde and ditsy Chrissy Snow (Suzanne Somers). But the three friends face the possible wrath of landlord Stanley Roper (Norman Fell) an old-fashioned guy who would never allow such an arrangement. With the aid of Roper's wife Helen (Audra Lindley) the three manage to convince Stanley that Jack is gay (when he is in fact a notorious ladies man). Jack's friend Larry (Richard Kline) also fashions himself a player on the local singles scene and he makes regular appearances on the show. Following Season 3 Stanley and Helen left the show in pursuit of their own spin-off titled The Ropers. Don Knotts (of Andy Griffith Show fame) was brought in to play the new landlord Mr. Furley - a nave loud-mouthed ditz who tripled the hilarity of every scene in which he appeared...The Three's Company (Season 1) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere 'A Man About the House' in which roommates Janet Wood and Chrissy Snow throw a going away party for their roommate Eleanor. In search of another roommate to lower the rent burden the two run across Jack Tripper passed out in their bathtub. At first the two women are apprehensive about Jack becoming their third roommate but since they can't cook and he's in cooking school they agree. The only problem is convincing their old-fashioned landlord Stanley Roper to allow a man to live with two women. They convince him by telling Stanley that Jack is gay... Other notable episodes from the shortened Season 1 include 'And Mother Makes Four' in which Chrissy attempts to conceal from her mother that a man is one of her roommates and 'Roper's Niece' in which Mr. Roper sets Jack up with his promiscuous niece in order to see if Jack is really gay...Below is a list of episodes included on the Three's Company (Season 1) DVD",5.0
" It was inevitable that Three's Company would be released on DVD the only surprise is that it took this long to get here. Finally the first 6 episodes of this landmark sitcom that aired between March & April 1977 are preserved on digital. Each episode is a classic in its own right and memorable if you know the show. Three's Company more than anything John Ritter did best displayed his talent for comedy especially physical. Ritter had the ability to turn the lamest storyline into a laughfest. This also is easily his best and most popular work other sitcoms such as 'Hearts Afire' and '8 Simple Rules' hold no comparison and its obvious that the only reason those shows made it was because of Ritter's involvment. The same can be said about Three's Company to some extent not to exclude the contributions of Joyce Dewitt & Suzanne Somers. Some are of the mindset that Chrissy was the show (maybe she just thought that) but I've always thought it was about Jack. He should've been paid more not because he's a man but because if he left the show it would've ended. 8 simple rules doesn't have long believe me. Three's Company was special because all of the characters were important to the show and they each were hilarious in their own right",5.0

" I would have to say that Threes Company is probably one of my all time favorite television sitcoms. I remember trying to watch it when I was a kid but couldnt because the material was deemed to sexually offensive by my parents. Fortunatly I was able to catch the show when I was older and have watched it when I could catch it in reruns. Thanks to Tv Land that was everynight. I would have to say that the release of this DVD was something I had not expected and was very suprised to find it at the store.All six episodes from season one are here to watch and enjoy anytime you like. Sound quality is good and the picture is also pretty good. If you do buy this dvd its for the terrific performances of John Ritter Norman Fell and Audrey Lindley. The only complanint I had with the Dvd is that it does not have a play all feature on the main menu so if a show ends you have to start another one instead of the shows playing straight through.

" I was a late convert to Three's Company but I got into it when my husband started recording episodes on our Tivo. This is a collection of the first six episodes and lays the groundwork for the series. The chemistry among the cast is readily apparent and John Ritter's physical comedy is genius! Janet and Chrissy find Jack passed out in their bathtub one morning after a going away party for their roommate. They need a roommate and Jack needs a place to stay and bing bang boom the premise of the show is born. But this is the 1970's and a man living with two women is a bit scandalous. The Ropers the landlords of the building won't hear of it. So Janet tells the Ropers that Jack is gay. Even watching this show in the 21st century it is evident how ahead of it's time it was. A gay man two women living with a man and innuendos galore demonstrate just how ahead of its time the show was. ",5.0
" What a find!!! This short collection from the first season of Three's Company. The programme is just as funny if not more so than the UK version which most episodes are based upon.Originally screened on ABC without much optimism in spring 1977 the first six episodes introduce us to Jack Tripper and his two female room-mates along with the Ropers - the landlords of the apartment.Just one of the six episodes is a fresh US episode - Roper's Niece which I found to be just as amusing as the other five.The boxset has no extras just a bare bones set with the six episodes. Grest to see the late John Ritter starting in the role he became most famous for.I loved it for the genuine laughs on the show as well as looking at the fashions prices hair and late 70s attitudes on the show.After these six I had to immediately purchase season two which I'm finding just as good as this.Even though it's 30+ years old this is a quality show and well worth owning.

" Has it been almost 30 years since the debut of Three's Company? Many good and bad shows have come and gone but Three's Company remains a familiar sitcom providing laughs and good memories. With the passing of John Ritter still on most fans mind it is extra special to watch the earlier episodes especially. He was a brilliant physical comedian/actor and dramatically underrated too. Gone too are both Audra Lindley and Norman Fell who were so good they branched off and had their own series. They live on in these episodes and in our hearts.One thing interesting about the first season is how different (looking and acting) each character is. Jack and Chrissy are both very into each other but follow the rules and keep things relatively clean. Speaking of Chrissy she is more reserved and not the complete 'ditz' she transforms into in later seasons. Janet too is less bossy and protective. I think only Jack stays pretty much constant through the years.This collection features the following episodes",5.0

This season may be short with only having 6 episodes but it's still worth buying because the episodes are funny and Amazon is offering it at a great low price! ",5.0
" Three's Company first hit the airwaves almost 26 years ago and it presented its North American viewers with a comedic styling that was truly fresh and new. Both the brilliance and the downside of the series lay in the simplicity of its plots. Usually the fun and mayhem of the episodes would result from some sort of mixup or misunderstanding would occur which caused a friction obstacle or problem that the characters would have to overcome. Ultimately the misunderstanding would always be resolved leaving the beloved cast of characters pretty much as we found them. But as with all great comedies the show's strength and uniqueness really did lie in the mix of the show's central characters and the actors that portrayed them. The original casting of John Ritter Joyce DeWitt and Suzzane Somers as Jack Janet & Chrissy - the three roommates of apartment 201 - is perfect right from the start. Add to this mix Norman Fell and Audra Lindley as the romantically frustrated landlords Mr. & Mrs. Roper and you're set for one wild ride of a show. What truly is unique about the series is the fact that the show really was an ensemble piece - and when you revisit this series you really do find that no one actor rose above the rest. All of the actors involved in the show shared a particular gift for comedy especially the late John Ritter whose timing pratfalls and physical comedy truly were second to none. All-in-all it adds up to a great series that really has the power to make you laugh. The show didn't start off so smoothly however as the casting of the female leads took awhile. In fact three pilots were shot all involving different actresses but all involving John Ritter as Jack Tripper. As such the first season of the series which is only six episodes long didn't premiere until March of 1977. And now the entire first season of this series came out on DVD and in spite of a lack of extras Three's Company is worth adding to any DVD collection. ",5.0

" Three's Company is the first and last sitcom to effectively blend physical comendy with effective one liners. Many of the popular sitcoms today such as Friends and Will and Grace have the satisfying one liners but are opaque in the area of physical comedy. John Ritter's falling over the couch tip toeing not to be seen and tripping over things elevate this sitcom from great to amazing.In 1977 the kind of double entendre humor spoken all through the series invoked snarls on conservative TV viewers. Yet it was that same humor that made it numder one on the Nielson Ratings. It's King-like status on TV because of the sexually racy humor attracted viewers because of it's innocence about sex. The humor wasn't for shock value. The lines about promiscuity were delivered by the cast as innocently as we heard it over the tube. That child-like and non 'in your face' approach made Three's Company heartwarming as well as extremly funny.The series had few cameras working with the cast so the episodes have a unparelled equality to a one act on stage. Therefore it is easy to see the cast playing off each other for emotional support as well as professionally. It is hard to watch an episode of this gem and not laugh out loud And it will be extremely difficult not to well an eye for the late 'Man About the House' who paved the way for the phyisical comedians today. This series will never be equalled. ",5.0
" Hello I am the webmaster of the Jack's Bistro website. I received an advanced copy of this wonderful DVD last week and here is my review of it",5.0
" Three's Company is a jewel in the rough who knew that this 70's sitcom can beat out most of what's on TV today. It not only makes you laugh but the intelligent wit sarcasm and charm threw into each episode gives it a kick some jokes and one liners are so good that I can't believe I it took me so long to finally watch this. Of course I didn't discover it myself my boyfriend made me watch it - I saw the entire 1st season in one sitting and that's coming from a girl who doesn't like to watch TV! I couldn't get enough and simply had to see the whole thing.The premise sounds simple enough; two female roommates Janet and Chrissy who have a third roommate Jack - pretending that he's gay in order not to get evicted by the landlords Mr and Mrs. Roper. They are trying to balance their new friendship and the snooping landlords visiting parents and not get caught while going through challenges of life and work in a funny lighthearted manner. The stress in this show is comedic not draining to the viewer.I think there's something cozy and cute about 70's decor and even the semi hideous clothing that I find fascinating. My favorite character is the landlady her sarcasm is priceless and her smug remarks jabbing at her husband and lack of passion in the bedroom are sharp but unquestionably hilarious. Her eye rolling and faces are priceless too her character ads a level of delightful mischief to the show. The first season is just six episodes but I all ready have the rest and can't wait to sink into it. The real fun part is that each episode has a theme and things always go crazy and get out of hand for the roommates. Not getting caught or figuring out the problem is always a fun resolution at the end of each show.Fun and easy to watch perfect for the weekend when you can sit down grab a snack and try not to fall of the couch from laughing.- Kasia S.

" Readers when you purchase this dvd put on the pilot episode (entitled 'Man About The House') and fast - foward to the scene were Chrissy Snow (Suzanne Somers) finds Jack Tripper (John Ritter) asleep in the bathtub drenched in water. It is not only one of the funniest moments in tv history but the scene that shows what a genius Ritter really was.The release of 'Three's Company' on dvd is a bittersweet event for the show's fan. While it's great to have this piece of television history to watch anytime you'd like it's also sad because comes just months after John Ritter's shocking and untimely death. But as a tribute to his life and career it's great to have.And I'm not saying that Ritter was the only actor who made the people laugh. Somers and Joyce DeWitt (Janet Wood) set up most of the gags that happened on the show and sometimes outdid Ritter. And who can forget the late Norman Fell and Audra Lindley as Mr. Roper and his sex - hungry wife Helen. Their one -liners against each other were every bit as funny as Ritter getting smashed by a door or Somers delivering one of her stupid comments. Making an early appearance is Larry played flawlessly by the highly underrated Richard Kline. He appears briefly in 'No Children No Dogs'.As for the episodes the pilot is an absolute classic. 'No Children No Dogs' and 'It's Only Money' are excellent as well (the former features some of the best insluts between Helen and Stanley). As for the other three they are good too but not worth mentioning.My only gripe about this dvd is that there are no extras. No advertisements or a making - of documentary. I do not know if Anchor Bay meant to do this right from the start or they did out of respect for John Ritter. But it doesn't matter since the complete second season is coming out on dvd in March and is supposed to be loaded with extra. Until then this will keep you satisfid for a long time and you'll remember that three's company too. ",5.0
" About time already! This is a fun little DVD at an affordable price and it's an added bonus knowing a share of the proceeds go towards John Ritter's favorite charity. That's typical of the man himself",5.0
" As a child of immigrants growing up in the US life was always difficult. However coming home to watch 'Three's Company' always managed to put a smile on our faces. John's constant humor his eneregy his jokes always made us laugh. John's passing came suddenly. The release of this DVD (and many more to come I hope) is definetly a tribute to one of the funniest and hard working comedians of our time. Rest in Peace John. Thanks for all the laughs!

" I really can't add much that the prior reviewers have mentioned. I remember watching these shows when they first came on. I was 10. I'm almost 40 and they are still a blast..... Timeless and ageless. I enjoyed all the seasons but as in most TV series the first few years are the best. Someone watching these shows for the first time as 're-runs'...... May think shows like this were the norm in the 1970's but it was quite groundbreaking. However the bottom line is.... still great comedy after all these years!!!! ",5.0
" This is a great set of DVDs! To me the first season of Three's Company was the best. The funniest. With the original castit's priceless. I will watch it over and over and over--and still end up with sore sides from the giggles. I'd recommend this set to anyone who loves Three's Company. ",5.0
" I have very fond memories of this wonderful DVD set. I really appreciate that the producers put on the DVD season extras and left the shows 100% complete. No commercial interruptions is such a nice treat. I remember they used to show oodles of commercials between the segments and cut them up in syndication.Love it!MC White said",5.0
" Three's Company will always be the best comedy show that was on TV. When I heard that John Ritter had passed I did shed tears for the man because he was the best and will always be the best comedian out there. I have been waiting for the show to come out on DVD for a very long time. When I was a kid I would beg my mom to stay up so that I could watch the show. John Ritter will be deeply missed by all his fans. Rest In Peace John we all miss you! ",5.0

" Yes Norman Fell was a hilarious actor who will be missed. But John Ritter's antics and humor is what made the show the gem that it is. Without him that show wouldn't have lasted a season. There could have been no else to perform with the silly sweetness that John had. He was hilarious but at the same time heartfelt and honest. I love Norman I agree with you that he was very funny but give John the respect that he deserves. Without John there would not have been a Three's Company. ",5.0

" Wow its about time. This is one of the best comedies ever made. It's sincere and fun. While a tad naughty at times it NEVER disgusts or embarrasses parents in front of their kids.

" I never watched this show when it was on the air. I am 31 and watched episodes in earnest when I was pregnant with my first child 2 years ago. Oddly enough I watched it on VH1 in the middle of the night thanks to pregnancy induced insomnia. I loved the show. John Ritter was a comedy genius. Such a physical actor like Lucille Ball he had great timing wonderful facial expressions and he owned every scene he was in. The girls and landlords are good too Jack and Janet played so well off each other. Thoroughly enjoyed this show! ",5.0
" I never realize that season 1 only had 6 episodes. I guess they were still testing the waters at that time. I'm glad they did because I laughed so hard and just ordered the next season to continue the laughs. Worth the few dollars to add this to my collection. I plan to order the rest one season at a time. ",5.0
" Yes you can catch this program running in syndication frequently on many different channels so why buy it? Well I started thinking about a time in the future where it may cease to be aired and I feel this is a show that will continue to make me laugh way into my golden years ",5.0
" Watching Three's Company again after all these years I did laugh a lot and not only because of some nostalgic feeling that overwhelmed me having grown up expecting every single episodeevery single week with a sort of enthusiasm that comes with the anticipation that something good is about to happen; But I also enjoyed watching the show again because simply it is one of the best sitcoms ever produced for television in any language.Yet I could not help feeling a tinge of sadnessreliving all these funny and wonderful episodes at the early and untimely death of its star John Ritter.The success of Three's Company was certainly due to the excellent writing that combined successfully the situation comedy with the physical/slapstick genreone that unfortunately is nowadays either overlooked by the new breed of comedy writers or not well written/deliveredin addition to a very 70s touch of sexual innuendos and harmless cliches about 'bimbos' and 'gays' that were good natured and never sexist or discriminatory.All the actors contributed their best comic talents and timing to the show from the cute and smart Joyce de Witt the naive sexy and sweet Suzanne Sommers the Roppers Norman Fell and Audra Lindley to the later actors who replaced some characters like the genuis of a comedian that is Don Knotts who became the new landlord post '79 to Sommers replacements Priscilla Barnes and Jenilee Harrison.But as much as the show made these actors household names its success was equally due to Ritter.The sweet clumsy and charming qualities he brought to Jack endeared him with millions of viewers and ensured that the show ran from its first season in 1977 all the episodes from which are included in this DVD to its last season in 1984 amazing continuity",5.0
" FINALLY! No more need to keep knocking on the door -- It's here in all it's 70s glory! The first season of Three's Company has arrived and I'm here to tell you about it.Well it is only six episodes -- but all on one disc. Reason being is that Three's Company was a mid-season replacement so there's only six to begin with.Not much on the extras but a nice bonus. From the menu you get to pick which one you want to watch and when you select it it has a quick written overview of each episode. Unusual and nice for a DVD TV series. Bad part is once you watch an episode you can't hit the forward button to pass up the credits or go to the next scene -- it automatically ends the episode taking you back to the main menu.Otherwise you'll be happy to know that a percentage of the cost of the first season DVD will go to John Ritter's favorite charity for cerebral palsy (something his older brother suffered from) and that the next season will have more of a tribute to John. So whereas the contents are fairly minimal the price is definitely worth it and more will come in the next disc.No more waiting for you 'Door Knockers' out there -- Three's Company is here to stay. ",5.0
" I am so happy to see this DVD. I only hope the other seasons will become availabe as well. The greatest sitcom in tv history as far as I'm concerned. 'Jack' is adored by my 8-year old little girl (and myself). Rest in peace John and thank you for bringing laughter and joy to my home. ",5.0
" This was a classic show... and let me tell you it easily holds up against today's sitcoms. I laughed so many times during each epsiode... usually because of John Ritter's style of comedy but really every actor in this show has their moments. And when you hear the audience laughing that's no laugh track that's a REAL audience which really adds to the quality of the show.Watching the show mostly when I was younger I had no idea until now how good the writing was on this show... it's actually very intricately written and pushes the level of comedy to the max! A really amazing show!And if you are worried that the first season of Three's Company may not be as good as the later seasons have no fears the first season is hilarious!The DVD has a short synopsis of each episode no other features. The image quality is excellent. ",5.0

" Here is one of John Ritter's funniest shows from the 70's.This show featured a lot of diffent faces thru the years but was always funny.Jack Tripper was always getting into difficult situations and was very clumsey.One of my favorite episodes is when he dressed as a Grandma to enter a cookie contest to win some money.Than the Judge tried to kiss him and he coughed and got out of it.Also Jack had to pretend he was gay so he could live with two girls.The Roper's and Furly were pretty funny to.Here is the episodes from season 1.Note this was a short season and only contained six episodes.1)A Man About The House-This was the pilot that started it all.2)And Mother Makes Four3)Roper's Niece4)No Children No Pets5)Jack The Giant Killer6)It's Only MoneyThere will be no extras on this disc however season 2 early next year will have plenty of them according to Anchor Bay.Originally season 1 wasn't suppose to come out till early 2004 and Ritter was going to do a commentary but it got moved up to November.What a great way to honer John Ritter by getting this set and all future three's company seasons sets.Now if only Seinfield would hurry and come out.I also recommend the following tv dvds coming out.Sanford And Son Season 3 Oct 7Incredible Hulk Ultimate Tv Colection Oct 21Little House On The Prairie Season 3 Nov 4Honeymooners The Complete 39 Episodes Nov 11 ",5.0
" The 1970s' marked the rise of the sitcom. There were early signs of this in the 1960s' with shows like 'The Nelsons' and 'The Donna Reed Show'. Shows like 'All In The Family' were among the first hit sitcoms But the sitcoom boom didn't really take off untila round 1974 when 'Happy Days' and 'Good Times' hit the air. These shows opened the door for a long line of sitcom hits - 'The Jeffersons' 'The Facts Of Life' 'Barney Miller' and many others to name a few. Thrown into this barrage of sitcoms was 'Three's Company'. It turned out to be tv gold garnering huge ratings and making star out of Joyce DeWitt Suzanne Somers and of course the late John Ritter.'Three's Company' was first aired in 1977. Shows like the ones I just mentioned were in their peak period. But 'Three's Company' was different from most. Its plotline was more risque",5.0
" I have almost every episode on VHS videotape and they are now falling apart. Whenever I am in a 'blah' mood and need a 'pick-me-up'...bam I pop in an old tape. I had recorded them all on VHS at LP mode to fit six hours of shows per tape....man am I glad to see them coming on DVD and I already pre-ordered season one. I live in Los Angeles area and I actually went to at least 30 tapings of the show over the span of it's TV production run. Can't wait to see the DVD version.....(I only hope they kept the bloopers/outtakes and interviews etc. and they make it to the DVD's as 'special bonus features'.) They goofed up sometimes and the studio audience always loved it!John Ritter's humor and schtick filtered it's way into my style of bartending when I worked for TGI Friday's in the 80's. It helped my tip income for sure. I hope they put out 'Hooperman' on DVD and only wish Hooperman could have been given a better chance than the one season run it had. BUY this DVD if you love humor that is timeless at times it seems John borrowed from the great ones like the Stooges Abbott and Costello and the young Jerry Lewis and put his own touch on it....The ladies on the show gave John the perfect platform to do his thing! Joyce we wish you would work more we love you too!To the Producers",5.0

" I haven't watched THREE's COMPANY in 7 years. I own every single episode of the series on VHS but I decided to purchase this DVD because I read the good reviews concerning the quality. Indeed the quality is great but the smart ear will hear some audio changes on the episode 'Roper's niece'. All of a sudden the sound becomes slighly inconsistent with the rest of the episode for about a minute going back and forth; you will hear certain sentences on the right side of your TV speakers and then switching to the left; you must really have very sharp ears to notice this change. Overall great transfer and great investment. ",5.0

It seemed so innocently 'racy' back then and to young working people it seemed like our own lives reflected through a fun-house mirror!

" Anchor Bay is doing us a solid in making the short season one (it was a spring replacent show in 1977) into a quick and inexpensive single disc release out well before the end of 2003. I had a chance to catch part of the recent 'Three's Company' marathon in which 2 of the 6 episodes from this season were aired -- 'Pilot' and 'Roper's Niece' -- both of which had my sides splitting. The pilot episode could not have been executed any better and it appears as if this was one of only a handful of TV series in the annals of history that began a long run already in full stride. And in six episodes nonetheless!I highly recommend this and future season releases beginning in 2004 -- which will contain bonus materials! John Ritter may be gone but thanks to his large body of work and my DVD player I won't be forgetting him.(For those thinking Anchor Bay is simply out to make a buck off the passing of TV legend John Ritter take notice",5.0
" The first season of Three's Company. One of the funniest sitcoms around. The story of two girls who need a roommate. After throwing a party (in the first episode) Janet and Chrissy find a man sleeping in their bathtub. . .eventually they become roommates.A lot of storylines on the show revolved around misconceptions and misunderstandings. The on-going joke that the landlord thinks that Jack is gay. In the first three seasons the landlords are an older couple named The Ropers. And their on-going joke about him not wanting to sleep with her. Kind of like Al Bundy on Married...with Children.Guaranteed many laughs. Rest in peace John Ritter. ",5.0
" Finally this show has came to DVD. I'm looking forward to this DVD and I hope they come out with the other seasons rather quickly. This show is defintely one of my favs. Never could understand why they want to put these new shows on DVD after still never went off the air as of yet. Glad somebody is finally waking up hope they get the same idea and put WKRP in Cincinnati on DVD. Where have these great sit-coms gone? This dvd will give a great tribute to John Ritter. ",5.0
" I know there are people who don't like Three's Company and think it's too silly but I think they just didn't give it a chance. My older sister who is nine years older than me doesn't like it and thinks it's too silly but she is very picky anyway and is more into drama shows. I love this show which in my opinion is a classic! Joyce Dewitt and Suzanne Somers were very good as Janet Wood and Chrissy Snow and so were Norman Fell and Audra Lindley as landlords Stanley and Helen Roper but my favorite of all was John Ritter as Jack Tripper he was so cute and funny and he will be greatly missed! Jack's friend Larry played by Richard Kline only appears in one episode in the first season but thankfully becomes a regular for the rest of the seasons. The DVD only has 6 episodes because the first season was a mid season replacement. All of the 6 episode are very funny I don't have one favorite but I like them all the same. The price of the DVD is very reasonable and proceeds are being donated to UCP (United Cerebral Palsy) in memory of John who's brother has CP. A very worthy cause! I very highly recommend this DVD and I'm looking forward to getting the second season and all the rest of the seasons. John Ritter will be missed but never forgotten! BTW",5.0

" Three's Company in my opinion is one of the all time greatest comedies to ever hit television. I watched this series as a young child when it was on tv and used to naively laugh especially with the physical comedy of John Ritter. As an adult of almost 40 I still laugh out loud. This is actually a really good comedy for just about the whole family because although there are various innuendos most young kids won't understand them. It's ashame that there aren't more comedies like this on tv now. I'd recommend this series to anyone. ",5.0
" These are just as funny now as it was when i was little. These DVD's are an excellent gift for the Three's Company lover in your family. ",5.0
" Man this show brings back memories. For starters I wasn't born yet when it was first aired on television. I saw it in its syndicated glory years later as a little kid. Though some of the innuendo went clear over my head I just knew it was hilarious. John Ritter (as Jack Tripper) was introduced to us on this program as a fantastic physical comedien. This man looked like he was made of rubber! The way he ran around with boundless energy and made wonderful use of the broad and bawdy humor to his advantage. What's more his supporting cast was absolutely terrific here. This co-stars Joyce Dewitt and Suzanne Sommers.I won't go into detail about plot here but I will say that the stories are centered around the lives of three roommates--two women and a man. In order to get the 'okay' from their landlords on account of their slightly 'unconventional' living arrangments Jack Tripper (Ritter) passes himself off as gay [which he is anything but!]. Chaos strikes many times but not without plenty of laughs along the way. Enjoy! ",5.0

" Brilliant music made by old friends from the era when swing was still forming but at the same time the foundations of modern jazz were layed in Fletcher Henderson's orchestra ('Queer Notions' and some other songs).This is a really hot and swinging Henry 'Red' Alllen's slightly dixielandish date featuring Coleman Hawkins (tenor sax) J. C. Higginbotham (trombone) Buster Bailey (clarinet) Cozy Cole (dm) as well as some younger but still hot players.However the leader is particularly expressive in the ballad 'I Cover the Waterfront' - no wonder I found it cited as one of the classical Allen's performances. Late fifties were good not only for modern explorations",5.0

" This movie was by far the best action movie I have ever seen in my life. The acting fine the action is NON stop the lines are cut like a knife and D is amazing. =) Most people who review this film can't review it fairly because of their bias towards the director. Well I don't know the director or his other work and I think it's incredible. If ... has a copy BUY IT. It's is INCREDIBLY RARE. ",5.0
" This surprisingly stunning movie was really just something I rented because I had seen everything else. I needed to watch a good movie and not the commercial junk with overated computer graphics. Then I saw this one. They only had one copy of this movie in the store so I thought that this would have to be a low-budget movie. 'Why the heck not' I said to myself and picked it up.I've never regreted that choice in all my life.What struck me was an action movie with a poetic heart. In all the excellent shooting there is an 'in between the lines' essence of the beauty of life portrayed differently in the many characters in the movie. Good acting by some great acting by most. Ice-T does a good job playing the 'bad guy' and I'm tempted to say that this is one of Christopher Lamberts finest pieces of work.The ending of the movie will probably disappoint some but look between the lines here too and also here you'll find that everything about this movie wreaks of excellence. You'll actually probably also come to the conclusion that the movie couldn't have ended better. This one is a true classic and I am surprised it didn't get more storm than it got on its release. Well let me just uproar a storm and tell you to watch this movie. Action humour drama heck it's got it all and then some. Highly recommended warm hearted action movie! ",5.0
" This movie is really awesome I dont like to look at it as just a b-movie but maybe just a low budget action movei low budget isnt always necessarilly a b-movie. The acting is excellent I think. Christopher Lambert is an outstanding actor and I dont care what anyone says about him he can play any type of role. Ice-T is in top form playing the all time bad guy. This movie is very cool not necessarilly plotless or pointless. Just shows alot of the things mercenaries do and what they will do for it. This movie has alot of humor often sexy even a bit dramatic especially towards the end. And is of course filled with nonstop action and one of the best. Very enjoyable anybody who likes awesome action movies then check this one out its killer. And as for the bongo music I dont normally like that kind of music but it fits quite well for this movie.

" Ok the only reason I watched this movie is because of Christopher...aka Lu. I watched it again because of what the movie is...I mean come on...everything about this movie is in your face. This is not a drama this is not a social piece...this is a cult classic. Blood death and more death. To quote D 'When you drop a bunch of guns and bats into a room of killers and tell them to go...their gonna go.' And that is exactly what this movie does. It is action packed the entire time. We even get to see some Highlander skills come out when Lu fights with a baseball bat and uses it more like a sword. You may not understand the movie but just roll with it and enjoy the experience. And remember don't hold the knife...throw it. ",5.0
" Every so often a movie comes along that changes the way we view humanity the universe and God. Every so often a movie takes us to great heights of joy only to lose it and then get it back over and over again as heros redeem themselves as villains are vanquished. Mean Guns is such a movie indeed perhaps the greatest movie of the 20th century and maybe of all time! Mean Guns is destined to be mentioned first in the same breath as 'Gone With the Wind' 'Citizen Kane' 'Little Shop of Horrors' and 'Dude Where's My Car'.The complex plot concerns a shadowy criminal organization knows as the 'Syndicate' just finished constructing of all things a prison! To this prison are summoned the Syndicate's assasins who unbeknownst to the assisins were caught by the Syndicate stealing or betraying this underworld conglomerate. So the ringmaster of this get-together takes the assasins' weapons at the door and then gathers them in a main room the prison is locked and tells them that they were 'caught stealing' and now they were to fight each other down to the last three alive which would then split 10 million dollars between them. This festive occassion would be watched by the Syndicate on a closed circuit television screen.Now to start this contest the ringleader tosses several vats of guns bats and ammo in on top of the assembled assasins. I think you can figure out where the movie goes from there. Indeed as the fighters spead out all over the vacant prison alliances are developed complex philisophical issues are raised like the prevelance of pervisity present on MTV or the overuse of profanity in the movies appropriate pharmaceuticals for todays assasin to take in a nutshell a veritable graduate course on applied ethics taught through the dialogue in this film.Indeed as Hoss Crowe Barbie Moon Marcus Dee Rickie Kam Lou Oslow Bad Hair Guy Screamer Joey Big Bob Staircase Guy and Blackie ruminate on life the universe and everything it boggles the mind that Mean Guns was not nominated for 12 academy awards.There is so much one can learn from this film! Like the childhood story of the 'Three Cannabalistic Bears that go out looking for food one day' 'Why you shouldn't swear when you dont have to' 'What could be better than Pay TV' and why 250 people trying to kill each other 'ain't the junior league or the girl scouts or Melrose Place'.All this as the movie is set to the Mambo music of Perex Prado? What more could a movie goer ask for. And as Lou says of Prado 'He makes you wanna dance' indeed I felt like dancing as this movie made my soul soar when I contemplated the heights to which mankind may reach when properly motivated by shotguns baseball bats and 10 million dollars.All in all this film has a fascintaing premise the film is truly an escape and well done. I wish director Pyun was able to put more money into the development of this film. Also I hope there is a directors cut somewhere. Mean Guns is an amazingly good movie despite how preposterous the plot may sound. More and more people love this movie as we trade and pass around the DVD. Mean Guns gets more and more fans every month! No one knew this movie in 1997 but now there are at least 6 websites devoted to Mean Guns.Get this movie its worth it! ",5.0
" I first saw this one night just because there was nothing else on. Nights like that can really let you find 'sleepers' and direct to video movies like this is. I am not saying this is an oscar type movie but if you like gun fights or action it is worth a look.The action is almost beginning to end with only spots to delve into the personal side of the characters. But even as small as they do I still felt as if I got to know them.The music is not the standard with a latin flavor. Now I am not a fan of this type of music but it fit great into the pace and action of the movie.Overall it was a movie about killers killing each other and there was a ton of gun fights <and other close range weapons> but off hand I dont remeber a gorry or over graphic scene. The worst scenes left the graphic to the imagination and just used sound and camera angles to show 'just enough'And a small note to any Christopher Lambert fans... He is awesome in this movie. If you like him worth seeing just for his role. ",5.0
" The 'plot' gets laid out pretty quick. A bunch of criminals have been put inside a brand-new prison shortly before it is due to open by a criminal organization called 'the Syndicate.' Only three will be allowed out alive. The action starts when the Syndicate boss adds guns weapons and ammo by pouring them on top of the condemned. After that the movie is vignette after vignette of criminals taking each other out. If you pay close attention it ends up there is actually a more complicated plot stemming from unfinished business between the three meanest killers in the place.There is a homage to Christopher Lambert's 'Highlander' roles involving a baseball bat and some dude's head. The setting is simultaneously vivid and stark very interesting throughout. Some attractive ladies oddball criminals an innocent man (well he came voluntarily anyways) an old West style shootout gold teeth and great comic timing.This isn't thought-provoking or deep but it moves quickly and has a good mix of action blood and wry humor. It's a perfect movie for those times when you don't want to think too hard. ",5.0
" I'd never heard of this movie until a friend described it and we later watched it. Incredible! The plot is simple but the sub-plots most definitely are not. There is a lot of violence in this movie make no mistake about it but blissfully little blood and other unnecessary gore. Instead I found it oddly compelling and philosophical with a great performance by Ice-T. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of high action movies. ",5.0
" At first glance Mean Guns seems like another brainless action movie. The plot is simplistic the action is fast and brutal and the sound of gunfire can be heard in every scene. But looking a little deeper you find a surprisingly effective tale of redemption and guilt set against a simple backdrop where the characters can grow. The dialogue is very well written the characterization is perfect and the mambo soundtrack fits the carnage perfectly. And the ending will blow you away (pun intended). Some of the actors are a little stiff but the leads Christopher Lambert Ice-T and especially the guy who plays Marcus all perform very well.This movie is definitely worth checking out. The violence will put off a lot of people but those who remain will be rewarded. This is my favorite movie. ",5.0
" I don't know what any of these pretentious jerks are talking about. This wasn't meant to be a 'great movie'. It didn't set out to move you or give you deeper insight into yourself or the world at large. This movie's purpose isn't to inspire or to give a greater depth of understanding to the human condition... and if you watched it hoping for any of that hippie crap you are stupid.This is an action movie. There is gratuitous violence killing and foul language. Of the Three things that can make a pulp movie good (Karate Explosions or Midieval Stuff) this movie scores a 2/3. Thats pretty good. I might be stretching it with the explosions bit but when there is THIS much gun-fighting I count it anyway.There is tons of great action even more great one liners. Christopher Lambert plays his role brilliantly when you consider what he is supposed to be playing and even Ice T does a good job.If you don't like this movie its because you are a snob and you are expecting too much from a movie that is CLEARLY meant to entertain. If you liked this movie it means you know what an Action movie is supposed to be about and you are probably Hardcore as well. ",5.0

" I really didnt want to comment on this film especially since my kind have been called out earlier in these other reviews. Lambert fan. Check. B-Movie fan. Check. Mambo fan. Check.So let me address some of the important issues first. I am so sorry its a violent film with no deep human meaning or understanding. And if that was your complaint then you better not own a copy of Hostel or any other Torture film.Second there isnt suppose to be an action hero in the film. If you want a meaning to the movie it is simple. Crime does not pay. In a world of crime and lawlessness eventually even your fellow criminals turn on you.Why does Lou have his daughter at the prison? Did you watch the film. Lou is either a complete Nut Job or vengeance seeker. From the red flashbacks he either killed a child kidnapped his own daughter and murdered her mother/father. Or he his doing what he says he is doing trying to make good for him and his daughter.Vampires? Vampires? you mean the guy with the fangs at the gate? Or the demon winged guy Lou sees on the building? The first guy is a bodyguard of Moon's who for some reason has custom made teeth in the shape of fangs. So what. He isnt a vampire never even crossed my mind that way. He just fits in as a poser gang style thug. Very cyberpunkish. The 'demonic image' on the roof is a hallauciantion of Lou's similar to the boy in the hallway.The movis is simply 90 minutes of action set with decent music and fun editing. The characters are largely stereotypes but no more then Spider-Man Captain Jack Sparrow or Shreck. So relax pop some pop corn turn off your brain and enjoy it for what it is.Or you can go rent Matilda. ",5.0

This book gives all the nitty-gritty that you will need to set up or rework your dream shop. It definitely helped me. ",5.0
" I have to disagree with the other reviewers that this book onlyhas info for folks with cash to burn. There are a lot of greatideas that can be implemented at all sorts of investment levels.And a number of the shops they feature are not crazy 'dream'shops -- there are several one-car garage and basement shops thatare quite reasonable for any person who is serious enough abouthaving a shop that they'd actually go to the trouble of buyinga book about setting that shop up. And I also have to say thatthis book is much more practical than 'The Workshop Book' in theTaunton Press Workshop Classics series.

The author covers the advantages and pitfalls to various shop problems and locations. He effectively covers working with what you already have and does not necessarily recommend building a shop from the ground up. Mr. Nagyszalanczy does a commendable job of getting you to think through your needs and habits along with his insight ( and examples of others' shops ) to set up a functional habitable and not necessarily costly work shop. This book saved me time money and some amount of frustration and embarrassment. Well worth it. ",5.0

It has photos of working shop layouts that are encouraging to the home builder some of the shops are amazingly compact!

" For 1978/79 Miller's debut feature is tightly directed and highly engaging thanks almost to the constraints that had to be imposed because of the films amateuresque style. Gibson breaks out of his screen starting gate like a racehorse the villain gang is well (and humourously) put together and the plot is as souped-up and humming with power as practically all the vehicles shown therein (remember that post-apocalyptic sci-fi thrillers only became well and truly cliched after the third installment of this series). Still the real stars of the show in this picture are the cars themselves. Those Interceptors painted yellow and marked 'Pursuit' are the best thing to happen to a Datsun since the invention of the 454hp engine and scoop. Miller directs the road sequences with zest and conviction - so much so that the frenzy of the death highway comes out to stab the viewer in the eyeballs at times. There are a few funny bits with deaths etc. Most are well executed [except for the Edwin Nealesque (he's the guy who gets smushed under the wheels of that truck at the end of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre') demise of the ludicrously camp biker leader 'The Toecutter'] but watch out for the sequence where Max runs the bikers off the bridge right after his wife and kid get splattered. Look for the guy in the red helmet and brown jacket (I think he's also wearing a white aviation scarf) who falls on the road (most of the bikers being catapulted over the railings). Found him? Okay good. Now wait until you see the front wheel of the bike to the left of him smash him in the head and jerk his neck forward. That actor must have died! No way could anyone have lived through that without serious hospitalisation. Hmmm.... was George Miller trying to get too opportunistic with that? Anyway - it's a damned fine film given its unripe origins so go see it whether you're familiar with the trilogy or not. Scholastic work for sure. ",5.0

" Mel Gibson has a history of playing borderline psychotic revenge-driven loners from contemporary actioner Martin Riggs ('Lethal Weapon') to widescreen epic hero William Wallace ('Braveheart') to hard-boiled noir tough guy Porter ('Payback') to historical fiction family-man-pushed-too-far Benjamin Martin ('The Patriot') to the classic Shakespearean originator of the mold Prince Hamlet ('Hamlet'). You could almost say it's his niche.And in all fairness he started young. Mel Gibson was an impossible 21 years old when he starred in this 1979 throwback to 1960's biker thrillers produced by the then-unknown team of George Miller and Byron Kennedy. A huge hit in Australia it was limited to small theatres drive-ins and arthouse runs in the United States...where despite a dubbed dialogue track that would make most kung fu movies seem Academy Award-worthy it picked up a loyal cult following and enabled a small group of would-be hipsters to be able to say 'Mel Gibson? Oscars? P'shaw...he'll always be 'Max Rockitansky' to me.'The movie is not exactly original...it's a redux of the American western with elements of the aforementioned biker flicks but it is VERY original in its use of some very innovative cinematography (cameras mounted at fender-level on fast-moving cars...I'm not certain it had ever been done before) and some of the more unbelievable stunts ever filmed the like of which would not be seen again until the sequel's release in 1982 ('Mad Max 2' or 'The Road Warrior' depending on your location). The action is more personal because it is REAL.Mel Gibson's performance might not seem on par with his better roles since but the role he was playing was that of someone much older than himself at the time...and it can't be denied that even at 21 he had a command of the camera he has never relinquished; you can't take your eyes off him. Of his earlier roles Gibson is rather self-conscious of his performance in 'Mad Max'; he refers to himself as 'Mr. Porkchop' in this movie somehow under the impression that he must have been overweight at the time...but fans of his will want to see this movie to see how he looked before his days as a household name and to chart his development as an actor.Fans of action movies will want to see how movies of this nature looked in the 'old skool' days before high-budget special effects when the level of action in your movie was dictated by how far your stuntment were willing to push the envelope of sanity. In Australia during the making of this movie and 'The Road Warrior' it fast became evident that no such envelope even existed. The result is a piece of hand-made brilliance of guerilla filmmaking that would inspire latter day innovators such as Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez into accomplishing so much with so little.And of course the fact that this DVD is equipped with the Australian dialogue track is a selling point unto itself (it also shows exactly why a dub track was used for US distribution; it's not that we can't understand the accent mates...we just have no idea what the slang means). That and the commentary track by the production team make well-received treats for those of us who are old enough to have loved this film since its original release. A retrospective on Mel Gibson's career and its beginnings is also a nice addition. I can only hope that 'The Road Warrior' gets a similar treatment (and soon).In short you have a great movie with a a great DVD extras package at a VERY reasonable price...I don't know what more a movie buff could ask. This is definitely a 'must-own' for your collection. ",5.0
" MAD MAX is one of my favorite Mel Gibson movies. He's just a kid but he comes across as genuine and ultimately vengeful. Max is a member of a black leather-clad police force in an unspecified future. He's an 'interceptor' and a good one. When his partner is burned alive by a gang of insane bikers (led by the notorious 'Toecutter') Max quits the force. When his wife and child are murdered by the same gang Max leaves his own sanity behind and becomes a killing machine bent only on revenge. He hunts down the 'Glory Riders' slaughtering them in a suped-up black monster car complete with a towering V8 and nitrous injection! MAD MAX deserves it's place in movie history. George Miller re-invented the high-speed chase scene. I recommend that you get a copy right this bloody minute... ",5.0

" Featuring a fresh faced Mel Gibson as a young cop who faces down mobile savages on the highways of a dystopian Australia of the future. Mad Max managed to make a virtue of its modest budget with some startling influential stunt work and array of weird and surreal characters. Mel Gibson is perfect in the role of the idealistic young cop who feels that he is slowly becoming dehumanised by the brutality he is embroiled with on a daily basis. He quits the force and takes off with his family to try and escape from the madness and decay that is nearing fever pitch. However when his family are killed by a gang of marauding bikers Max becomes the very thing he was trying to avoid a broken monoslylabic avenging angel in souped up pursuit car. Very much a character in the vain of Clint Eastwood's man with no name from the spaghetti westerns Max is a brooding intense man with a capacity for terrible violence. ",5.0

" This DVD is like watching a brand new version of the film with crisp imagery in letterbox format. For those who haven't seen this movie it's the original story of Max and how he eventually becomes the 'Road Warrior' as portrayed in the sequel. The film was done on a lower budget than its successor but contains great action with some terrific stunts. The main attraction of the movie is his work as a pursuit officer on the highways where outlaws are running havoc over an understrength police force. Max and his peers are almost as rough as the outlaws creating a gray area between justice and crime. The story centers around Max's aggressive pursuit of an escapee named the Knightrider resulting in the outlaw's death in a violent car crash. The Knightrider's motorcycle gang then come looking for Max in retaliation and Max's family suffer the consequences. Max then transitions from police officer to vigilante going after the bike gang on his own terms.The movie is high-energy with souped-up Australian Fords and Kawasaki motorcycles screaming across barren landscapes in lethal chases. Max and his car an evil-looking black supercharged coupe wreak destruction on the outlaw bikers near the end and it's pure adrenaline by this point. The film may not be as polished or as wild as the 'Road Warrior' but it has cult appeal with the same flavor.This edition of Mad Max features the original voice tracks of the Australian actors that was never before available in the U.S. This surprisingly quite changes the atmosphere of the movie making the characters more realistic in a sense and far less animated when compared to the American dubbed version that feels more like an imported martial arts flick. I personally prefer this version.... ",5.0
" When I first saw this movie in 1980 it was the best thing since sliced bread. Mel Gibson in my opinion became a star that year. Since the movie's release to video and TV many key scenes were cut from the original theatrical version. For instance the scene where Max gets a chance to test drive the black beauty Interceptor and chases one of the bikers; he's full Nitro the red light starts flashing he's pushing the Interceptor to the limit and then...she stalls out. Though devastated this brought many a laugh from the audience. Another key scene",5.0
" ...not only do we get all the great features that we associaite with a DVD (Theatrical trailers TV spots documentary featurettes audio commentaries etc.) but it will also include the original Austrailian soundtrack something I NEVER thought I would see during my lifetime. (Most people already know that when the film was released theatrically in the United States in 1979 Filmways the movie's U.S. distributor dubbed the Australian actors with Mid Atlantic voices). The film was of course availabe at one time on DVD from Image Entertainment (it is now out of print); there was also a Japaneese Region 2 NTSC DVD that was released although I admittedly have not seen that version (I have yet to own an all code DVD player). I've also noticed a legimimate VCD version of the movie put up for auction on Ebay.

" Before I wrote a review for this film I had to get my hands on a version with the original Aussie dialogue to see if it truly mattered. Well the answer is yes it does. Other reviewers are correct when saying the dubbed version (in American English) makes the actors come off campy and it hurts the film a great deal. And yes dialogue is even changed slightly some more than others like when the one kid and his girlfriend leave town in his hotrod with the biker gang hot on their trail. In the American version he says 'Don't worry' to his girlfriend but in the Aussie version he says 'No worries'. I don't really think a dubbed English version was necessary. I could understand what they were saying even with the Australian accents. I mean imagine network TV dubbing Crocodile Hunter every week with an American accent...BAD IDEA! Now that the DVD is out of print (because ORION Pictures is out of business) let's hope Warner Brothers obtains the rights to this masterpiece digitally remasters it (Dolby Digital 5.1 or better) and gives us the Aussie Soundtrack. Japan released this film on DVD with both Audio tracks (But in Region Code 2 only) so it's about time we got the same thing. In fact Warner should re-release all three films in a nice box set and make them all special editions. The latest VHS version of The Road Warrior (Mad Max 2) included a retrospective documentary that was never included on the DVD. To me this is a great film that deserves the S.E. treatment. It's hard to believe it was only Mel Gibson's 3rd film (After Summer City & Tim). This movie is set during the decline of civilization and Mad Max 2 is set shortly after that when civilization is all but destroyed and scattered. Mad Max sets the standard for the sequals and truly gives us a man gone mad by the loss of loved ones at the hands of not just the bikers but the decay of life as we know it. I love the trilogy...rare that each one is uniquely special in it's own right yet still propells the character forward. Mad Max is a Classic so Warner Brothers needs to get a move on with that remastered version (you know they won the rights to it) so people can see the original Mad Max in all its glory!....G'day!

" This film has to be one of the greates road movies save possibly Mad Max II or Death race 2000. the car chase sequences are in my opinion better than those featured in Bullit. Despite the lack of dialogue from Mel Gibson or any of the other cast this still makes entertaining viewing. the right mix has been made with violence and gore and with a little storyline. The 'Cundilini wants his hand back' is a particularly humorous and those with a dvd player or decent video should freeze frame this part. Watch ou also for the fantastic stunts especially at the start of the film as a V8 pursuit vehicle flies through a stationary caravan. If you liked this stunt consider getting hold of the banned from T.V version of the vidoe of 'The Cardigans' 'My favourite game'. In this video you will see many great automotive stunts especially as a car flies through a parked camper van Mad Max style. Unfortunately many videos I have seen namely the Warner Brother's edition in the three-box set have been cut in a very crude and thoughtless manner detracting from this film. I would agree with R KOEGEL and KENNETH MARBURY that a director's cut version or any uncut version should be launched NOW. SO PLEEEEEASE make an uncut version of this film. ",5.0
" This review refers to the new Special Edition DVD that has just been released.Both widescreen and full screen versions are included but more importantly the original Australian dialogue has finally been restored.

" Finally! The original version of 'Mad Max'!

The nomad bikers are far more menacing 'the Goose' is more charasmatic and Mel himself more believable. Unfortunately nothing can save that painful 'brown shoes' scene but hey that's what the 'fast forward' is for.If I had any problem with this version at all it would be that since they moved it to 5",5.0

" It actually isn't Gibson's first movie he had a small role in one before Mad Max but this is his first starring role and the one that began his ascent into fame. Mad Max is set in Australia in the near future. It hasn't gotten as post-apocalyptic as Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome but you get a definite feel of bleakness and of the apocalypse. What Mad Max is is basically a car movie. But what a car movie. The cinematography is great (and at times dangerous for the camera operator).As a dvd the Special Edition is great (the reason I haven't bought Road Warrior is that I'm hoping they'll be releasing a special edition with the extras like contained on Mad Max). The commentary track doesn't have the director or Gibson but it does have the DOP Art Director a film historian and so on. They give a lot of great insight into the making of this film. There is also a 'trivia track' which flashes up trivia during the film. It also will point out every continuity error in the film. One of the great highlights of the dvd is that it is the original Australian recording (though you can access the American dubbing but I think that is more for showing what dubbing does rather than to watch). There are a couple of featurettes and trailers. It's really a good dvd. And a great movie. ",5.0

" For those NaySayers that give this movie anything less than 4 stars are you off your rocker? This movie was put together for $100000 by ametuer actors and directors. It grossed $100 million worldwide in the last 30 years. It did this with few special effects no computer graphics no high paid superstar actors... It did it with a compelling plot convincing acting great character development we can identify with the characters and their motivations awesome vehicles car chases (some of the best ever on the big screen) and stunts and it scores and A for creativity especially the ending! Just thinking about it there are at least a few of the most amazing car chases ever only to be outdone by RW. Aside from its sequel The Road Warrior (which I would give 6 stars if possible) it's difficult to think of better post apocolypic or car chase movies that also have good acting and a real plot and character development. Can you even think of a cooler car than Max's V8? The other yellow and blue police cars are also so sweet.As for this one and RW they were copied countless times which is impressive to say the least.

" `Mad Max' an Australian flick and one of the very first movies to feature Mel Gibson has probably been seen by most people after they saw the two sequels `The Road Warrior' and `Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome'. This circumstance has probably lead to a lot of misunderstandings about the circumstances of the original `Mad Max' plot.Basicly the story is about the failure of an organized system of justice leading to a downward spiral of individual outlaw revenge and retribution. Unlike the relatively new post-apocalyptic genres exemplified by the latter two movies the issues of revenge are as old as the classic Greek playwrights all the way up through Eugene O'Neill's take on the old Greek story of revenge in `Mourning Becomes Electra'.There is but one little clue that this is a post nuclear war scenario. This is when we see a rusty and delapidated sign warning of a `Forbidden Area'. The only corroboration is the relatively poor condition of the sign over the entrance to the police station. Balanced against these minor visual clues is the spanking new sign over the door to the service station indicating that this is a licensed auto mechanic and the very clean and efficient looking hospital room and building.So if there is any failure of civilization it is largely metaphorical and seen in the failure of the constraints of lawful behavior to prevent a series of events based on unbridled libido and revenge.Of the `Mad Max' trilogy the second `The Road Warrior' is probably the best for many reasons and it's connection to our current subject is loose at best and it's production values are far superior but our original has an odd rawness about it which should not be confused with poor quality. TV stations would not be running this flick regularly if it did not have something special to offer.By far the most valuable currency offered up by `Mad Max' is the anxiety created for Max's wife and child in the last third of the movie. The fear is about as raw as it comes with an odd similarity based on the crude cinematic technique all the way around with the terror of the original `Texas Chain Saw Massacre'. The horror movie is much less artfully done and draws a lot of it's impact from pure quantity of gore but there is a strong sense that both movies gain from a lack of polish.Oddly I think most of the juice in this movie comes less from Gibson's performance as that of the heavies. Unlike Harrison Ford's early appearances in `Star Wars' for example I see little of the promise which Gibson shows in the second and third films in this series.I will go out of my way to watch the second and third movies but the first this `Mad Max' is really something of a guilty pleasure which survives rewatching and grows in stature as time goes by.

Well with this new DVD release of the film complete with original Australian dialogue it felt like I was watching a brand new film! You can switch between that track and the US dub for a good laugh.

" Mel Gibson has made a career of playing Angry Mel--an initially decent man who having suddenly and violently lost what he holds most dear gets royally pissed and goes on a vicious vengeful rampage--in movies from Lethal Weapon to Payback to The Patriot to Braveheart but it all started with this one.Mad Max takes place in a dystopic future. Not the postapocalyptic wasteland of the later Mad Max movies but a decaying semiliterate society frighteningly close to our own. In this time motorcycle gangs led by the sadistic maniacal Toecutter have taken over the roads of Australia and the government (or what passes for the government) can barely manage to keep things just shy of anarchy.Only the Main Force Patrol (MFP) the police force stands in the way of the gangs. However they aren't much better for in their mad pursuit of their quarry they tend to leave a trail of civilian casualties in their wake and they seem far more concerned with the thrill of the chase than maintaining the peace.In this world the only things that matter are speed and quick reflexes. Whoever has those rules the roads. Those who have neither on the other hand usually end up as flaming wrecks on the side of the highway.Into this state of affairs enters Gibson as Max Rockatansky the top Interceptor on the MFP who with his fun-loving partner Goose daily takes to the roads to pursue the Toecutter's gang. He seems to be a more decent sort than his fellow officers hence more sensitive to the endless parade of horrors he sees on the job but manages to hang on to his sanity thanks to his loving wife and young son. Of course this happy (?) situation can't last otherwise we wouldn't have a movie...and you can guess what happens next.There are so many things to love about this movie",5.0
" In the not-too-distant future the roads are ruled by anarchy. Gangs control the streets destroying anything in their path and killing as they please. A rouge cop sets off on a suicide mission to take out these ruthless thugs after his wife and child are murdered out of spite by the gang leaders. As opposed to the over-the-top action that drove THE ROAD WARRIOR in the years to follow MAD MAX is a much more character driven film with all of the heart and soul that was missing from the subsequent sequels. Mel Gibson provides a powerful breakthrough performance as Max a man pushed over the edge by hatred and grief. Director George Miller creates a series of dynamic chase sequences filled with incredible stunts and heart-racing suspense. While the film appears to be extremely graphic and violent Miller tastefully implies the most horrific moments off-screen. In the most devastating sequence where Max's family is run down by Toecutter and his gang the camera focuses on the road just past the action as the bikers speed past and a small shoe and ball sprawl across the pavement. The combined effect of George Miller's fast-paced action beautiful cinematography and timeless revenge plot make MAD MAX one of the most exhilarating post-apocalyptic thrillers in the genre.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies ",5.0
" Personally I loved Mad Max. To me and more than a few of my friends who were into bikes back then (79 to 85) Mad max along with Quadrophenia made us feel like we were badguys (hey we were young). After watching Max and co young bikers across the UK attempted to emulate Max Goose Toecutter by being mean moody and more than a bit sad just as their predecessors had tried to emulate Marlon Brando (The Wild One) and Peter Fonda (Easy Rider) years before.The film although low budget is none the worse for that as it takes away some of the glitz that hollywood loves to throw into films and sometimes ruins by doing so (e.g. Thunderdsome Mad Max 3).The stunts are terific and the use of outback shots enhances the desolation the film seeks to portray. The acting is weak in some respects but the actors who portray 'the Goose' and 'the Toecutter' stand out even above Mel Gibson with performances that while believable are just the right side of over the top.The sound is excellent with good mood music work by Brian May. However in some places the speeded up driving and riding shots fail to work as well as they might. But in other areas the feel is just right e.g. Goose's ride out the morning after his night of passion with the nightclub singer.Overall a real groundbreaker which has rarely been beaten and which will still be remembered in years to come as a classic of Aussie cinema.

Its a snapshot of a different time and place in movie making a glance back in time as represented in the style of clothes the characters wear.

" The deterioration of society is the basis of the first Mad Max film. A dark vision of the near future the film's low budget works in its favour",5.0
" A cult classic this personally it's an all time favourite but I know a lot of people who hate it. A plot that is the stuff of westerns Mad Max is set in the desolate near-future where the police are fighting a losing battle against psychopathic bikers who wreak havoc on anyone they feel like. Even when arrested the law is virtually powerless to contain the thugs and they are generally released without charge. Super-cop Max keeps his cool even when his best friend is murdered but when they see off his wife and child Max decides enough is enough heads out in his super-charged V8 Interceptor (one of the coolest cars in cinema history) and embarks on a zero-tolerance one man campaign to wipe out the mad criminals. It's this finale that is the films main asset - Max is mesmerising as he relentlessly mows down all the bikers without giving them any chance of redemption. But the entire film is a real treat with a weird atmosphere and some truly bizarre scenes most of which involve the crazy bad guys especially hilarious main baddie Toecutter. Unfortunately though this terrible American print which I recently had the misfortune of seeing - or more appropriately hearing - ruins the film. The dubbing is truly awful turning the whole cast into ham actors altering parts of the script and even in occasional instances bizarrely omitting some of the sound effects. Oddly this print is also the one featured in the most recent UK video release. I must stress that the only way to fully appreciate Mad Max is to hunt down a copy featuring the original Australian soundtrack and preferably in Widescreen. ",5.0

" This is one of the greatest films ever made! If you had to say this film is about [REVENGE]. The story line is great.

They are The Road Warrior and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.But the first one is best. This is truley a Cult Classic. ",5.0

" If you own this movie and have this version of it then I'm sure you haven't even checked to see if the old US dubbed version of the dialog is included because it was awful! well if you're like me and you love this movie dearly as I do then you have seen it countless times and know all the dialog well here's the catch of my review of this version the original version! Watch it on normal until the scene in the wreaking yard then change the sound to the US dialog it is arguably the funniest thing ever to exist that US dubbed dialog on that scene! The voice of the grease rat yard worker makes me cry with hysterical laughter every time I hear it and if you love this movie as much as I do you may want to get this version for the great original sound track of dialog and even the humorous aspects of the US dub!The Special features are great too! Kind of a heart breaker to hear the truth behind the scenes but it's still wicked and worth every pennyNot to mention it's the greatest movie ever to exist and will never be dethroned! ",5.0
" April 12 2009 will mark the 30th anniversary of the Australian release of this film which was later released in the US during the summer of 1980. Being nine years wiser since my original review posting to this website I still can't understand why some one (perhaps George Miller himself) doesn't produce an uncut definitive version of this film on DVD. However since we're talking about a 30 year old film personal priorities and what's happening in the world itself perhaps there's no interest anymore in classic cult cinema. I sit here typing this message today while watching my DVD version of the film knowing that filmmakers are bound by certain rules when putting stories to film. However one can hope and dream...can't they. Here's a hyperlink to a website that speaks to those cut scences I told about in my original 1999 posting",5.0
" That's where it all started. In Australia and nowhere else. And I must say that landscape is impressive. It was science fiction at the time and it no longer is. In spite of all we have grown into that kind of frantic frenzy criminally biased and with no one to stop them. We are today speaking and have been for a while of a new criminal organization a new mafia a new gangsterism and it has come not to the desert but to our cities to our suburban areas. These new criminals do not want power control or even influence. They just want to make money and to get the thrill of absolute fear around them no matter what thrill actually but the thrill of robbing killing blowing up. They have no political motivations like in the late 60s and early 70s. They just want to feel blood on their hands and smell powder in their nostrils. They are not even well organized as money making criminals. They take tremendous risks and don't even hide their tracks. Being run after by the cops is fun and they can kill one from time to time a pregnant young female cop if possible. We have fully entered the modern criminal urban civil war and we better move our heads and rake our brains if we do not want them to take over whole neighborhoods where the law is going to be their law. That's exactly what Mad Max is showing and demonstrating. That's our future that's already our present. If you don't believe it just check with Grenoble in the Alps or wherever there has been an 'incident' (it should be called an ambush or a battle) of that type. What's more Mel Gibson had seen that the good ones in our society those who have authority will most of them decide that it is going against the human rights of these new criminals if we want to shoot them when they have a bullet proof vest on and a heavy automatic gun in their hands. Some in the press even believe you must - not should mind you - ask them for permission before shooting at them and they no longer use light guns. They use heavy military weapons. Some even call themselves the barbarians of the latter days and one of these gangs (all the members are in prison right now) tortured a young Jew to death over several days just because he was a Jew and the leader of the gang managed to go back to his homeland in Africa to find refuge which he luckily did not find because he was extradited back to France and what tried for his crime. There is only one way with these",5.0
" This is Mel Gibson's first starring movie role and he took the world by storm. This movie was a perfect vehicle to launch Mel's career. It gave him a chance to play the hansome hero with a full range of emotions (which he pulls off quite well). If it weren't for Gibson this movie wouldn't be anywhere near as good. Sure you get some good supporting actors but lets face it. This movie is about Max and Max has to carry the story.This is a low budget but excellent movie.There is certain scenes in this movie which you play over and overlike the scene when Max saw his black car.The crash at the start of the movie is awsome.I hate it when his wife and kid gets killedbut when he goes after the bikes and kills themit realy gets to you.While Mad Max 2 is my personal favorite of the 3 moviesthis is a close second.

" Mad Max is certainly not a movie for everybody especially not your Saturday night date but it has proved to be an excellent guy movie and it sucks that the good ol' USA had it dubbededited or how 'bout butchered. The dubbed American version has however grown on many of us and is certainly an excellent action/horror/western/biker movie. This version will probably always be available but if you ever have a chance to see the original or even own it you are in for a true delight. The Aussie dialogue is not as difficult as 'A Clockwork Orange' but can be hard to understand at times but you get what they are saying. Also there are several key sequences that were edited that adds to the tension (hence forth the horror genre). Although some would disagree a director's cut is certainly deserved to this cult classic one that restores the the original sounds and lost(?) edited scenes. MAD MAX is definitely a high energy movie that every guy should own. There is real movie magic at work here while still displaying an artistic approach(an angle rarely explored in action movies of years since its premier.) ",5.0

" I've seen Mad Max dozens of times but after watching the new SE DVD it was like watching it again for the very first time! That is not an exaggeration. The new DVD offers the choice of the poorly dubbed US soundtrack or the original Australian soundtrack. Watch the original track! The pacing of the film changes entirely as do the characters. The original soundtrack breathes new life into this film.The features are great there's a trivia track that pops up info about the production cars and Aussie slang terms used as you watch it 2 documentaries TV spots theater trailer and more.The print is fabulous and it turns out this is a film you really need to see in widescreen. Having seen it both ways now I can tell you that the pan & scanned version misses a lot of the stuntwork and chase scene action. If you've seen this movie in the past and thought 'It was OK' this new DVD will have you saying 'It was great!' ",5.0
" Right off the bat I want everyone who reads this review to know that Mad Max Special Edition contains the original Australian language track.I was mislead by another review it said that MGM's Mad Max Special Edition didn't have the original track but the old discontinued Orion version of Mad Max did. Well that was false information because after all the time effort and money it took to track down that elusive version it turned out to only play in the US Dubbed English Language track! So disregard the information in that review and buy this one.PROS",5.0
" To his feral state. Yes I'm aware of the feral child character in Road Warrior but in Mad Max we see the beginning of this imagined society's serious decline. It's rather humorous that a film that seems so low budget to us today can be as entertaining and riveting as this one is. Watching this now for the fourth or fifth time I have to say that this very young Mel Gibson did he not already possess a legitimate level of talent would not have been so believable in this role due to his physical appearance. His polish and chiseled features really don't fit in amid the band of miscreants that is the cast but we soon forget our initial impressions due to his performance. The people in Mad Max are far closer to man's actual state than most of us care to admit. The audience can completely relate to Max's reaction at the end of the film and we cheer for him and long to press our feet even more heavily upon the accelerator. ",5.0

" I remember sneaking into the Forum Theatre in Melbourne as a kid to see this gem (R rated). It is still as good today on the big plasma as back then. The boys come over and watch it every AFL Grand Final day. Glad to see they released this in the States with the original soundtrack. You will be amused to know we in Australia specially purchased your old version to see how it was dubbed. Pretty funny stuff seeing as Mel has a bit of an American accent in the film anyway. Love how it is all shot around where we live in Melbourne. If you liked this check out Odd Angry Shot another film not to be missed ",5.0

" This exciting futurist thriller tells us about a wild bunch permeated and invaded by a genetic wildness they are the equivalent to a deadly plague they rape and demolish everything they want without any drop of scruples.The script gradually will increase of violence level a couple first then the best friend of Max and finally in the famous sequence of the merciless attack on his wife and kid. From that moment the thirst of vengeance will assume human form. And the visual sequences of high level physical and visual violence will burn at your eyes. This movie and Straw dogs are to my mind the only two films of this genre worthy of remark through the period 1968-1979.An anthological film from Australia the great launching of Mel Gibson and George Miller that reached instantaneously a status level.

" As Bob Denver for all practical purposes became 'Gilligan' in real life -- as Frances Bouvier became 'Aunt Bea' and Bob Keeshan 'Captain Kangaroo' -- the young and beautiful Melvin Gibson in this earliest of roles was incredibly unbelievably fortunate to avoid career-long typecasting as nothing but a cheesecake eye-candy silver-screen pretty-boy.This fine debut film in which Melvin Gibson had to do little more than look extremely nice exude male lusciousness and wear tight leather pants came dangerously close to relegating him to Fabio status committing him to a relatively brief film future of appearance-only stand-and-model roles in subsequent movies. However the overwhelming power of Melvin's acting talent (facial expressions talking walking and driving vehicles) -- the raw guts of thespian talent and drive -- managed to save him from a perpetuation of calendar pin-up roles catapulting him to an infinitely higher plane of cinematic accomplishment than is accessible by a mere male model (see Bird On A Wire The River Lethal Weapon VII etc Melvin's list is literally endless).It was that determination which wrenched Melvin Gibson out of the male-model mold and elevated him to Oscar quality. Think of Gomer and Goober Pyle of Herman Munster Dan Rather and Sheila Jackson Lee... and see how intertwined how enmeshed how tied up those actors became with their roles. Melvin Gibson was lucky to avoid the same sort of typecasting that severely restricted the careers of these unfortunate folks and would have condemned him to being known for the rest of his life as nothing but a darn good looking hunk of meat (as they say).We all knew Goober Pyle -- and we can all say for a definite fact that Melvin Gibson (Mad Max) is no Goober Pyle.

" As an Aussie who saw this as a boy way back in 1980 I am saddened and dumbfounded to find that this was ever the victim of pathetic overdubs into US speak from the original Australian as though this helped the film in any way? Was the premise that Americans are so jingoistic that they aren't capable of understanding English spoken by Australians or simply that Americans only want to hear themselves? In any case this is a classic Aussie film back in the days when Mel Gibson considered himself an Aussie and was seen by Aussies to be an Australian.I won't harp on about the plot because other reviewers have done the plot to death. This film was shot in South Australia and the many brilliant and genius techniques for filming the amazing road scenes were developed by the Australian Director of this movie later to be adopted by film makers the world over. Anybody who doesn't understand that this movie is the BEST of the series has missed the point of MAD MAX as far as I'm concerned. I'm sure Aussies and Kiwi's alike understand the superb grittyness which has the stamp of Australian and New Zealand (Once Were Warriors) film making all over it without losing all the best features of great film making to HOLLYWOODISM...MAD MAX 2 was also a good film but Thunderdome became too Hollywood for my money and sadly doesn't do justice to the series like the original. I almost feel sorry for people who thought this wasn't ans Australian film... it's like thinking 'Gone with the Wind' was Canadian and sticking 'eh' on the end of 'Quite frankly I don't give a damn (eh?) talk about inappropriatsville! This is the the ONLY version worth watching... ",5.0
" MAD MAX may actually live up to that boast. This was Mel Gibson's first role in an action film and one of his only Australian films. The movie takes place in a post-apocolptic world where the cops just basically get their [bootys] kicked by road rats who pretty much rule the highways. 'Mad Max' Rockatansky is the only cop who seems up to par against the meanies. His Do-gooding (Or Good-doing......?) upsets one gang so mush they murder Max's best friend wife and child. Well wouldn't that just [tick] you off too? Of course so Max is on a hunt for the murderers to enact revenge. This movie had a dirt-poor low-budget little known actors and few chances of a sequel. Well the film was (at the time) the most financially successful australian film ever made catapulted Mel Gibson into stardom (he later was known for his LETHAL WEAPON films) and produced not one but 2 sequels one of which (MAD MAX 2 known in the U.S. as THE ROAD WARRIOR) is even better than the first. The action scenes are fantastic but one difference between this and your average action film is the character Max and his futuristic environment. They engage you in a way that not only can you just indentify with the character and imagine yourself as the hero he's so universal you can imagine anyone in his shoes doing exactly what he's doing. A very well made action film ",5.0

I have the VHS version of 'Mad Max' but it pales badly to the new special edition DVD. I had looked at buying an Australian version I'm glad I waited. The best part about the DVD is the ability to either watch the American dubbed version(ick) or the Aussie version. The American dubbing really knocked out a lot of the background noise that the DVD brings out... sirens horns a lot of little sounds that I've never heard on the tape...believe me I've watched this tape many many times... I think I could recite it in my sleep... TWO THUMBS UP FOR THE DVD VERSION!!!!!! ",5.0

" This is undoubtedly one of the most original and one of the best action movies around. I first saw it when I was 15 and though I thought it was a little wierd and disturbing at the time I just couldn't help liking it. I still like it today too. After Mel Gibson's wife is killed he just goes after her murderers and is total merciless! The most memorable scene to me is the one where Max handcuffs one of the killers to a car rigs it to explode and then gives the guy a hacksaw saying something like 'You've got five minutes to live. You could cut threw the handcuffs in ten. You could probably cut threw your wrist in 4.' That is such a cool scene!Anyway I wasn't going to write a review of this film until I read the review under mine. The one written by Mark Dewey from Australia. At the end of his review he says 'USA We're with you Sept. 11 2001' and being someone who was deeply affected by the attacks that just warmed my heart and made me smile with thanks knowing that even someone from the other side of the globe is supporting us.

" I and saw this movie the first day it opened on the big screen. In later years I purchased it on VHS LaserDisc DVD(US dubbed) and now Special Edition DVD. This latest offering is by far the best and the film is presented the way the director intended. This film is non stop action and makes the move to DVD very well. Picture and sound 100%. BUT for a US audience it may be a bit hard to follow from the perspective of different accent and Australian slang that are common in the movie. The provision of subtitles does assist the US viewer. The Trivia track certainly does not it is rather an insult to the intelligence of any viewer I'm at a loss to know why it was included. For example",5.0

" Yes it may be 'bare bones' compared to newer blu-ray releases(this isn't critereon) but this version rocks. I've seen mad max probably 102 times starting on VHS as a kid and i'm just noticing all the details (badge numbers signs brands etc) i've never seen in any of the other releases. Picture quality to me is awesome (just noticed the Nightrider has a small tattoo on one of his toes). Thats how much detail you'll see. I don't see any fan of the road warrior or mad max being disappointed by this. As mentioned in other reviews the superior australian audio track is on by default which after seeing the special edition release from a few years back is the way to watch it. I watched a few times through with the sub-titles on just to catch some of their slang/colloquialism's. I really didn't notice any issues with color or noise in the movie. Everything was just very sharp on a 2009 1080P 27' dell IPS PC monitor. I don't have hi-def audio running from my PC so I can't comment on the HD sound otherwise everything was great. Per the product description the DVD is an actual seperate disc unlike HD-DVD releases that put the DVD on one side of the HD-DVD disc. So you basically get 2 copies albeit one that is SD.

" Mel Gibson was originally dubbed over as mostly all the other actors where also to create an 'English Language' soundtrack version of Mad Max for its worldwide distribution. Thus pre-DVD the only way to hear Mel's original voice (the one he had when he turned up with bandages across his face with blood under the patches and the casting agents knew they had found Mad Max an outback young lad with some good looks and a penchant for licking out of the bottle all day long) was to get the Australian version of the film on video tape. Now on 'Special Edition!! (Check to make sure this review is for that version as Amazon sometimes changes products and moves reviews!)' DVD you can hear Mad Max the way it was meant to sound - 1 track Australian mono audio - but to be honest why brother with any 5",5.0
" A rookie director a dirt poor budget and a no name cast didn't stop Mad Max from becoming one of the most revered action films of all time. A pre fame Mel Gibson stars as cop Max Rockatansky in a post-apocalyptic future where he his buddy partner and his wife and child try to maintain a sense of civilization while ruthless biker gangs rule the road. When his family is slaughtered Max goes over the edge and the movie manages to get better and better. MGM has thankfully released Mad Max the way it was meant to be seen on DVD with the original Australian language track restored in place of the dubbed American accents that were infamously incorporated into the film for years on home video and television. The stunt work of the film is a definite highlight as is the young Gibson's performance as the hell bent for vengeance Max. Two sequels would follow the first of which entitled The Road Warrior managed to surpass this film and remains what many consider the greatest action movie ever made. ",5.0
" Take this simply as an informative review concerning this specific DVD release. When reading through some of the other reviews for the newest Special Edition Mad Max DVD there were some confusing complaints that I came across many of which were complaining that the DVD was badly formatted and that the voices had been dubbed over by American actors. After some further pondering I realized that the reviewers were commenting on a different DVD release that came out prior to the Special Edition as well as prior to this Decades Collection Edition.To put it plainly this is a retouched version of the theatrical release as far as picture and sound quality. The sound is in very nice stereo and the picture has been digitally restored and is in Wide Screen format. There are NO American voice overs added. There are a few extras on the DVD including poster art two documentaries and a few trailers. All in all I am very pleased with the purchase. It was extremely cheap for the quality. If you want a low-cost good version of Mad Max and are not too interested in a bunch of DVD extras this is a no brainer.P.S. Also included is a CD with some hit 70's songs on it including some Marvin Gaye and Rod Stewart...so if you haven't heard these heavily overplayed songs on the radio enough you can own them on CD at no additional cost!

" In 1979 an Australian film was released starring 23-year-old Mel Gibson. This movie he is a cop in the future. Only a few years ahead from the present point in time. It was a great hit and had two sequels follow it. Only difference about them was that they were during a post-apocalyptic period. But this one is the best one of all in the entire trilogy. It is a pretty normal movie with regular things happening most of the time. The action doesn't start until the end when Max Rockatanski seeks revenge on a nomad biker gang for the murder of his wife and infant son. Max starts out as a kind loving man. But once everything in his life falls apart and he loses the people who are most important to him he no longer sees the need to care for the lives of others. The evil bikers led by the Toecutter all suffer painful and terrible deaths for what they had done to Max's family. He starts out as a regular man with a job who has a family and a best friend. But sometime in the movie Jim Goose his best friend is murdered as well. Then Max decides to quit his job due to that one event. He just happens to lose everything he had. All you see of him in the end is Max driving a Canyonero and armed with a shotgun while wearing his police uniform. A courageous hero doing what he can to rid the scum of the area. This is the best movie to watch out of all three. ",5.0

" Mel Gibson is without a doubt one of Hollywood's greatest actors Mad Max was one of Gibson's first movies & you can tell by watching it that his success since(20 years to be exact) has not spoiled him In this he is Max a cop of the future where society has broken down & he is one of the last remaining cops patroling the savage streets we learn that Max has a family & tries for the most part to be normal in a burnt out wasteland the film begins with an outlaw named Knightrider who has broken loose & has killed a fellow officer he is pursued by two cop cars & is being chased Max's partner Jim Goose soon joins the pursuit but he & the two cars end up wrecking thus knocking them out of the pursuit Goose then radios Max who the Knightrider will soon be approaching to begin pursuit which he does...with intensity causing the Knightrider to crash & burn he is killed as Max watches from a distance what makes this film good is its direction we see the friendship between Goose & Max that is as good as any friendship Max's boss is interesting to watch as you can see he cares about his men we are then introduced to the Knightrider's motorcycle buddies who have come to get revenge on those responsible mostly the cops & Max himself Toecutter the gang's leader is fun to watch he is without a doubt a humorous villian you almost can't help but like him as he talks poetically about the Knightrider his loyalty to his fallen comrade is deep as he & his men soon terrorize anyone & everyone thus bringing the attention of Max & Goose who soon arrest Johnny the inexperienced member of the group it is clear that a woman has been raped & Johnny has stayed behind awaiting capture or has he it never becomes clear the rape has a vengeful effect on Goose who refuses to release Johnny after his bail has been set & he is to be released Goose is soon restrained as Johnny agitates him promising revenge Goose is soon set up & is burned beyond recognition Max feeling the loss takes time off with his wife & child but soon he & his family are stalked by the group & his wife is soon confronted alone & intimidated she escapes but she along with their child is run down with the loss of his family & friend Max becomes a lost soul & lone vigilante who uses his wit & skill to exact revenge in his new Interceptor Police car that has a turbo blast that creates unbelieveable speed when Toecutter Bubba & Johnny are the only ones left they set up Max & gun him down Bubba soon attempts to finish him but is killed instead Johnny then flees the scene as does Toecutter Max then goes after Toecutter in a rather satisfying scene in which Max uses his Turbo power to pursue Toecutter in a tense scene that has Max with nothing but vengence in his eyes Toecutter is soon killed as is Johnny & has Max fleeing into the wasteland that would continue in 'The Road Warrior' a great follow-up this film had a cult following & it is a true gem movies like this just don't get made anymore & the original Aussie dialogue is much more surreal than the dubbed version & Mel Gibson proved in this film the star he would later become this new DVD is sharp & clear & is definately a must for any Mel Gibson fan!!!!!

" Mel Gibson is so young looking in this film and so handsome! Wow this film is so full of action and even on a low budget you can't beat Mad Max!WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS!The film is about Austraila in the outback perhaps. It's in the Post-Nuclear future a town is being threatened by a ruthless bicker gang lead by the infamous Toecutter. It's up to what's left of the police to stop them!Our hero Max Rockatansky (Played brilliently by Mel Gibson) pursues the Nightrider a member of Toecutter's gang on a high speed chase. When Nightcutter dies the outraged Toecutter plans his revenge on Max and the entire police elite. He starts off by picking off Jim Goose a fellow officer and friend of Max's. Johnny a young lacky of Toecutter's sets a trap for Jim. Jim gets very wounded when they set him on fire. Max visits Jim in the hospital and is angered and horrified at what the evil biker gang has done to his friend. Max then does the wrong thing by resigning from the force and decides to spend some time with his wife and young son where the bikers are nowhere to be found.But no that doesn't stop Toecutter from wanting revenge it wasn't enough to burn Jim he had to pick on Max too! But this time he does something almost worst then the last time. This time these victims were innocent. He runs down Max's wife and infent son and kills his son while his wife suffers massive injuries to her internal organs and has to have both of her legs and arms amputated. God hasn't Max suffered enough already?!Now Max is clearly pissed off and gets out his police uniform and starts his vengence spree.SPOILERS END HEREThis is a very good low budget movie. I love the hair styles enough though it was made in the late 70s the hairstyles looked 80s. Cool. If you want to see a very young Mel Gibson then buy this movie or rent it! Mad Max is so awsome!

" Cult film or not most everyone agrees Mad Max is a remarkable film. Most reviewers and the documentaries included on the DVD rave about Mel Gibson's performance and they're right!But among the things that makes this movie so much better than its budget would seem to allow were the truly fine performances of most of the other actors. We're not talking Oscar caliber of course but strong enough to be believable and keep the viewer caught up in the story. Whether due to great direction or real actor talent (and probably both) these 'little things' really set the stage for Gibson's character to play out against.This was the first time I've heard the original Australian language version of the film and was pleased. The other extras were very good as well making this an outstanding value for the price!So after you've watched the movie several times and have gotten past Gibson's shining performance watch for all those other glimmers that are minor stars in their own right.

" This is a very funny movie that stars Martin Short as Murray a bumbling fairy god-mother who can hardly do anything right. His first job is helping Anabel Greening played by Mara Wilson. Anabel's wish is that her dad is auditioning for a part in a broadway musical and she wants him to get the part. Unfortunately Murray accidentally turns her dad into a statue. When Anabel her brother Charlie and Murray go to NAFGAa and tell the Queen of the Fairy Godmothers what happened she tells Anabel that if they don't reverse the spell by midnight he will remain a statue forever. Before they can do that they have to get the wands back from the evil Claudia. I highly recommend A SIMPLE WISH!!! ",5.0
" A Simple WishI watched this movie as a kid when it just came out on disney channel. Recently i remembered that i really liked it back then. So i ordered it on amazon. EVERY bit as good as i remember it!! Funny kindhearted GREAT to watch with the kids. Not that i have any i'm just saying. Martin Short teams up with Mara Wilson and their relationship [that of kid and fairy godmother] is amusing to follow. Kathleen Turner plays the role of the evil witch excellently and can be a bit frightening at times. All in all i highly recommend it! ",5.0
" 'A Simple Wish' is a cute fun family film. It's about a young girl named Annabel (Mara Wilson) who wishes for a fairy godmother. Her brother thinks there are no such things as fairygodmothers. Well Annabel's wish comes half true. Instead of getting a fairygodmother she gets a fairygodfather instead! Anyway soon they meet an evil fairygodmother who they try to destroy. It's very fun and really cute. I saw it on TV and it was very good. All the actors in this film give great performances and the script is pretty good too. I definitely recommend this film for families everywhere! ",5.0
" This movie was out about a year before my parents finally bought it for me. I simply wanted it because I thought the cover was cool. But when I watched it I loved it and I made all my friends watch it when they came over.The story is about Annabel played by Mara Wilson the girl from 'Mrs. Doubtfire' and 'Matilda.' While she is reading a version of 'Cinderella' one night she wishes that she could have a fairy godmother. And she gets one. Except her fairy godmother isn't what she had in mind because she is actually a man named Murray played by the hilarious Martin Short.Murray promises to grant Annabel one wish and she selflessly decides that she wants her father a widower to land the main role in a musical play. But it isn't that 'simple.'For one thing Murray has never been a fairy godmother before and he has a mentionable amount of difficulty with his magic wand. For instance he accidently takes Annabel to Nebraska and changes a rough-looking man into a gigantic rabbi.The second thing standing in the way of a granted wish is Claudia the fairy-godmother-turned-evil-witch played by Kathleen Turner. The witch and her hilarious sidekick are bent on destoying the existence of any other magic than Claudia's to ensure that nothing stands in her way when she decides to carry out some rather evil plans.The movie is extremely funny and has lots of great special effects. It is almost impossible to smile as you watch Murray screw up on everything he attempts to do and Annabel bicker with her older brother and her reactions to Murray's awfully-cast spells. So great is the presence of comedy wittiness and evil in Kathleen Turner's character that you look forward to the scenes she's in. And so you end up laughing through the movie marveling at the spell-casting scenes and silently cheering as the movie proves yet again that good conquers evil. AND throw in an interesting cameo from Terri Garr one of the supporting actresses in 'Tootsie' and you have every bit of a five-star fantasy that's perfect for the whole family. ",5.0

" Our 29 month old mastered this puzzle in 2 days so it has already sort of lost its primary challenge to her but she still loves it. She actually matches the animals up puts the corner pieces in and recognizes that straight edges go with straight edges. She can do it by herself with the rare verbal assistance from Mom and Dad.I think it's a great starter jigsaw puzzle a little more durable than the cardboard puzzles that might not fare very well with the age group this puzzle is intended for. The pictures are placed on the pieces in a way that enables the child to really see half the animal on one piece and half on the other so they can more easily put them together.The only problem I have with it is that the pieces are slightly difficult to get apart sometimes. This is not a huge issue at all as we are always around to help our daughter with it or she gets it herself as she is pretty dexterous. But just know that the pieces are sometimes 'sticky' (for lack of a better word).Some other reviewers have stated the the picture is not printed underneath the puzzle and I don't see this as a problem at all. It just added a little extra challenge. She actually had to think about why the bird beak does not fit with the cat toes etc.Great puzzle! ",5.0
" As with all Melissa & Doug products I have purchased. The puzzles are great. I have very physical grandchildren yet these wooden puzzles hold up amazingly well.

We have had them for over 4 months now & haven't had any chipping or splinters. Yes there are sometimes where she is grumpy & gets whiny about how she can't do it but that's when we just take a cue to sit with her as she usually just wants some company.

" An earlier review of this title was critical of Eric Bergerud's generalizing about the Vietnam War as a whole based upon his bottom-up analysis of a single province (Hau Nghia). While I agree in principle with that reviewer's critique one must add that such generalizations are inevitable and that most readers would be disappointed if DYNAMICS OF DEFEAT did not address the large question of how its findings might apply to the Vietnam War as a whole.Moreover the earlier reviewer fails to note that most studies of the Vietnam War employ purely top-down analyses based upon what are necessarily generalizations about the course of the war in South Vietnam's provinces. Since these works depend upon data (HES scores PHOENIX 'neutralizations' body counts etc.) aggregated at the national level -- and subject to deliberate and accidental distortion at many stages as they passed up the chain of command -- one cannot rely upon them as a sure indication of what was actually happening in the provinces.In short we will not be able to build a truly accurate picture of the Vietnam War until we have works like DYNAMICS OF DEFEAT covering many of South Vietnam's other 43 provinces in similar detail. ",5.0
" I was highly impressed by this book on Vietnam. It's a densely written historical account loaded with military of acronyms of the history of the Vietnam war in the strategic small province of Hau Nghia. This former province was located just northwest of Saigon.I think the author really got the war right. His accounts of the US pacification projects attitudes of the civilian population towards the US military attitudes of the GI's towards the rural Vietnamese anti-colonial nationalism of the Vietnamese etc. all ring true to my ears. It's consistent with my experience of 6 months in Vietnam with the 25th and with my subsequent attempts to understand the nature of that very troubling war.I believe the author learned the main lesson of Vietnam very well. There are very real limits to the use of military power. You cannot change people's 'hearts and minds' with military force. That is ultimately the reason why we lost in Vietnam. We didn't lose militarily we lost politically. The great majority of Vietnamese saw us as trying to colonize Vietnam--mistakenly I believe. Vietnam was more of an ideological crusade by the US than a sought after economic prize--it simply never had the resources. The North Vietnamese Communists despite all of their massive shortcomings were largely seen by the rural South Vietnamese as being their nationalistic 'anti-colonial' liberators. It was a war that we couldn't win is the author's conclusion. I'm in agreement with him. The South Vietnamese government never achieved any degree of credibility with the rural population--no matter how many bombs we dropped on their behalf.One wonders if this book might have slowed down our present White House occupant and his band of advisors if they had bothered to read it?Probably not. They are too busy repeating history to take the time to learn anything from it. Maybe all of that oil mesmerized them and all of that old history was simply too boring to take the time to read about.

" The book details many or most of the important dynamics of the war as it took place within a single provice. In the process Bergerud reveals much about what is important to know about the war as a whole.For me personally this is possibly the most important Vietnam book I've read. This is because it provided me a framework for understanding the war from the beginning of American involvement to the end that I still use.For many readers this could be an important first book to read about Vietnam and America's relations to it.

" My first reaction was 'oh my god... I remember that!'. While you may date yourself by admitting this I can also assure you that you will enjoy most of these songs if you are a child of the 80's. There aren't a whole lot of collections featuring the distinctive dance sounds from that era but this set manages a nice variety that will transport you back. 'Classics' such as 'Living On Video' 'Point of No Return' or 'People Are Still Having Sex' will transport you back to school dances in a simpler time of 80's capital greed.

I admit it gets frusterating explaing over and over again about how badly the 90's affected the music industry and no these are the original artists. The songs in this set are a good foundation for anyone seeking to go back in time and worship at the alter of 80's Gods.

" Try this album after a rough day at work. Or better yet while you're at work. More Eno-esque than Eno himself! This collection brings together the very best elements of Eno's Ambient Music work into clear crystaline jems of structure. Each piece has a strict internal logic. Progressions and patterns grow organically following the rules of nature - they feel like branches and leaves growing from a stem. Primarily synthesizers and lush vocal samples combine then dissipate into silence as indeed they must. The pieces are rhythmic with deceptively simple yet haunting melodies. These guys have been producing some of the best Ambient music since the mid 90s. Hard to find but worth the effort. ",5.0

" I was lucky enough to see her perfom this concert live in DC so I think this CD is extra special to me because it reminds me of living out a lifelong dream. I listen to this CD and I honestly get a lump in my throat and chills all over. True there are definite signs of Barbra's age audible. Her voice is huskier and you can hear some strain which is most evident in the opener 'Starting Here Starting Now'. But is that bad? After 40 years in the business she has one of if not the best voice in the business. Her signature songs all sound great",5.0
" This is a fine recording of Barbra's live show. Well worth the expense and much more reasonable than the 1000.00 tickets were on tour...everything you expect is here and more. Most enjoyable? 'The Music That Makes Me Dance' the great Funny Girl tour-de-force finale that was cut for the movie and substituted with 'My Man'. Some of the songs are accompanied by my other favorite entertainers Il Divo. The sound is supurb. The selections wonderful. ",5.0
" Had it been almost anyone else you could say this program goes off in too many places (too much time on 'Funny Girl' not enough on the 1970s hits). But with Barbra there are so many wonderful places to mine how can one complain? The glorious resurrection of 'Have I Stayed Too Long at the Fair' is alone worth the price! But what struck me on this recording was Barbra's increasing ease with the audience during the patter breaks. For once it seemed more spontaneous and not so 'from the script'. What I love particularly about this set is that it evokes mem'ries (sorry) from nearly all periods in her unparallelled career and for those of us going past 30 or 40 years as fans it reminds me of the exciting feeling of buying her latest record..that anticipation has never been equaled for me and this wonderful concert may leave you feeling that way also.

" Her Majesty our Lady Queen Barbra This double CD of her world tour last year was heart-warming and as someone who only became a fan of hers less then 10 years ago - I have to say she inspies me still and her strength of Heart to keep moving and giving of her heart which can be literally felt (particularly in her LIVE concerts) - gives me the strength to keep going in the world with courage.It was great to hear the original broadway overture to Funny Girl.And all the old songs that only us Hardcore fans can appreciate.The ochestrations were adaquete but they weren't Marvin Hamlisch. Marvin Hamlisch had a polish to his arrangements that couldn't really be beaten and there is a reason he won grammy awards and that his two concert tours with Barbra won Emmy awards etc...Barbra's voice is sounding strong and you can feel that she has all the energy and the passion she always had but yes there is actually a scratch sound in her voice that is a little sad to hear and you know when you hear it that it is because her voice is tired. Listen to People at the end of Act 1 there is a sharp scratch near the begining of the song that you will want to ignore i promise you. It could be heard in Julie Andrews' voice in the broadway version of Victor/Victoria and also for Judy Garland near the end of her career. It is also particularly prevalant in songs that she does every time like 'People' and 'The Way We Were' (half way through this song you hardly recognise her voice).and also 'My Man'.I still want to listen to this recording alot more before I tire of it as I did previoulsly with the 1994 concert and also Timeless. Please don't let this put you off buying it because you should as a harcore Barbra fan I guarantee you it is a true love-letter from her to you.The songs with Ill Divo are great and you will love hearing them.She talks alot about Funny Girl all those tid-bits are delightful to hear She also chose all the material well.She had alot of help and consideration about the choice of material and she did really well. Particularly in stringing them together it sticks out like a saw thumb a bit towards the end but you'll love it anyway.Okay enough from meGo but it tell me what you think.Bye-Raymond. ",5.0

With authority and power she reveals dimensions in the material that we had to accept on faith alone 40 years ago. I was in tears throughout. Hearing these old songs again I was amazed to realize how much of the soundtrack of my life she provided. Thank you Barbra. Please keep singing and entertaining us. We need you! ",5.0
" I had a chance to go to this concert - but passed - for fear that it wouldn't live up to her '94 Concert which I DID attend - BIG MISTAKE! Yes her voice has continued to mature but never underestimate this superstar. Her selections were sublime and delivery - well - isn't that why we all love her? True fans can really appreciate hearing some of her lesser known material - and by the second cd her voice really sounds well oiled and resonates beautifully. I'm now sorry I didn't go to this - it sounds like an intimate evening with an old friend - the one who has provided the soundtrack to your life. ",5.0
" We Streisand fans have been absolutely spoiled. From Central Park The LA Forum Ramirez Canyon and continued with the '94 and Timeless concerts we have been treated to a series of great live recordings. Luckily for us the streak continues with the Live in Concert '06 CD collection. Il Divo joins the very small club of Barry Gibb Lauren Frost and three 'Main Event' back-up singers as performers who have shared the stage with the legend. They provide a unique harmonic balance to the concert although the recording cannot possibly convey their stage charisma adequately.Two score and five years ago a musical career was launched. Although the voice has matured and the range is not what it once was the interpretation and delivery remains top echelon truly an actress who sings. For anyone fortunate enough to attend an '06 performance the recordings will certainly engender fine memories.Anticipation being what it is I am eagerly awaiting the DVD of the concert tour but I suspect it won't be released until after the completion of the '07 European tour.

" The music is ok on this yes her voice isn't what is was in the past but everyone gets older. Still wonderful to hear.I saw Barbra on her first night in Chicago on the 2006 tour and although this fulfilled a lifelong dream of seeing her in concert I was not at all impressed with her choice of Il Divo. They were overly loud and I hadn't paid $350.00 to see them. And now after seeing clips of Barbra's European Tour shows I feel robbed. The concert she did in Europe is the one I was hoping for.

" Barbra Streisand has now released six lives albums / CDs during her prodigeous career each one unique in representing her at specific times in her legendary journey as an entertainer and artist. This new recording is a more casual and nostalgic affair than anything she's done live and is much the better for it. While 'Live in Concert 2006' shows a bit of 'wear and tear' in her vocal ability that's like saying Maria Callas hit a wrong note. Streisand is now 65 and still doing it her way. What she may have lost in range and suppleness as the result of age she more than makes up for with her interpretive skills and her pitch-perfect phrasing. This lady knows how to deliver a song like no one alive.What's most exciting about this CD is that the song selection almost completey ignores more obvious choices (we've gotten them on other dics...now was the time to stretch and boy did she) for songs she has rarely performed or has never recorded before. The opening overture which is the complete overture from her classic Broadway show 'Funny Girl' let's you know you are in for some time capsule offerings that no one else could surpass. In fact many songs from 'Funny Girl' permeate the disc as do several esoteric songs Streisand recorded earlier in her career that were exquisite non-hits. Brilliant.Yes there's the obligatory duets with Il Divo but Streisand has always managed to channel her old-time glamour into one or another of the current pop crop almost always with sterling results (Neil Diamond Donna Summer Johnny Mathis Barry Gibbs...and the list goes on). Streisand's show business savvy has continued to make her relevant to generation after generation.Finally Streisand's in-between-song patter is a real treat here. Less formal and polemic than on other recordings she is humorous warm folksy and quite self-deprecating. A delightful performance.Streisand will hopefully continue to record for years to come because this CD proves that her talent is not only still intact but relevant and delightfully dextrous. Lucky for the record buying public. ",5.0
" A true artist Streisand has been evolving since her first recordings and continues to. When she first came on the scene I thought 'As she moves on she will be less shrill and become more subtle.' She became less shrill and more subtle. And then later I thought 'As she moves on she will become less concerned with perfection and more interested in living breathing artistry imperfections and all.' She became less concerned with perfection and more interested in living breathing artistry. And then I thought 'She's always thought of herself as an actress who sings but eventually she will come more to live the songs as she sings rather than portraying a character singing them.' That progression is fully evident on this album. As is the happiness of this stage of her life which has allowed her to relax enjoy and be comfortable on stage. The bottom line on Barbra is she has never ever stopped studying has never stopped learning has never stopped in the words of one of her best songs being ready to 'Move On.' I think she is singing more magnificently than ever I think she is an even deeper artist (and that's saying something about an artist who began very deep) I think she is even wiser (and she was always wise) and I think what comes from her reveals more than ever her very heart--which is above all ethical and truthful and in some ways holy. I met her once and was so impressed by the person--not the star not the diva (didn't see anything like that) but the person. I've first hand experienced her kindness and generosity. My theory has always been that only someone who suffered terribly as a child could as an adult bring forth the emotion insight understanding and passion she has brought to her art. It's all here in this album to be experienced over and over. It's not only a thrilling listening experience it's a master class in achieving excellence. ",5.0
" I've studied the voice for years and years and have always been literally amazed at the reach and the far-beyond-the-reach results that this one-of-a kind artist has given the world. There never has been isn't now nor ever will be another like Barbra Streisand. I've followed her through show music pop disco back to pop into theater music and movie music and of course the treasured rare live performances such as this one. I've accepted her personal feelings to be what they are and have cheered her every step of the way and will always do so. So to have a glorious live recording of her recent concert tour is a joy indeed. The best thing about this recording other than the utterly flawless technical sheen of the actual sound is the fact that Barbra Streisand has finally seemed to mellow to enjoy life and most wonderfully to embrace performing. She sounds charming and relaxed in her spoken passages and she can still send notes through the roof of the stadium with enormous power and grace. It's a treat to hear songs that she hasn't sung in years and to hear numbers that she's not recorded before. Just about anything that Ms. Streisand chooses to do for the public is a genuine thrill for someone who has been a devout fan for decades. But and this is the melancholy part if you've studied her voice for years so much that you know exactly how it has sounded across the almost 45 years she's been a professional you'll know that her range has diminshed slightly her top notes have to be finessed without full power and that the timbre has darkened and deepened. These are not bad things because she remains the one and only of her kind and everything existing so clearly in our memory must bear witness to time's effects. But it's heart-tugging for me to hear her age reflected in her singing voice. I've listened to this album repeatedly over the past week because it's a terrific concert but I've also found myself with a heavy heart sometimes in hearing the changes in her vocal prowess that are only natural. She is still and will continue to be my personal superwoman figure and someone whom I admire more than any words could possibly communicate. But the tears that I now shed when she sings are for both of us because if Barb's getting older than I am as well. ",5.0
" For those who attended one of Barbra Streisand's twenty concerts last fall there's no reason to explain this release. For those of you who missed it this is a chance to hear what all the fuss was about - and trust me the fuss was worth it.'Live In Concert 2006' is a two-CD collection capturing the finest performances from her record-breaking tour. This audio event is absolutely breathtaking and is honestly the warmest and most excited Barbra has ever come off in a live performance. You can sense that she really enjoyed this tour. The two CD's contain 32 tracks which include 22 songs culled from performances recorded in New York Washington D.C. and Fort Lauderdale Florida.The album includes Streisand staples that have been heard on several of her greatest hits collections and five previous live albums. But to be fair there would've been a backlash against Barbra from longtime fans had she omitted these songs.Disc One is a treat to hear with Streisand recreating her 60's heyday when she was the toast of Broadway television films and nightclubs with songs she hasn't sung since they were performed all those years ago. The album kicks off with a recreation of the original overture from the Broadway musical Funny Girl that was supremely orchestrated under the supervision of musical conductor Bill Ross. Enter Streisand and she opens the disc with a spine-tingling divalicious rendition of 'Starting Here Starting Now' a song she first sang and recorded in 1966. It's almost as if Barbra needed to open the show and prove that she can still wow the audience forty-six years into her career. It worked. This woman can still deliver the goods. After her 'opening remarks' about how she felt the need to raise money for issues that needed to be addressed in today's climate she launched into a spectacular rendition of 'Down With Love.' After the crowd-pleasing 'The Way We Were' Barbra's vocals glide effortlessly over the Harold Arlen classic 'Come Rain Or Come Shine.' Another track on the disc includes the first song Barbra ever composed entitled 'Ma Premiere Chanson' lifted from her 1966 masterpiece Je m'appelle Barbra. Other never-before-performed live songs include a set that weighs heavy on Funny Girl which includes a moving and haunting version of the title song plus a sample of 'The Music That Makes Me Dance' (the song that was featured in the Broadway production) and a rousing and emotional delivery of 'My Man' as well as her signature song 'People' which is complete with the original introduction.Disc Two wisely manages to keep the show fresh by reinventing some of her staples with her special guests Il Divo with new interpretations of 'Somewhere' 'Music of the Night' and 'Evergreen (From Disc One)' which was sung partially in English and partially in Italian. The highlight is when she ventures into uncharted territory with songs she has never recorded or performed before including a gorgeous rendition of 'Unusual Way' from the Broadway musical Nine 'The Time of Your Life' (a reading from writer William Saroyan) which was the perfect segue for the next track a vocal tour de force of 'A Cockeyed Optimist.' The other never-before-performed standard is a stunning interpretation of 'My Shining Hour.' She closes the show with a reprise of 'Don't Rain On My Parade' lifted from the Broadway production of Funny Girl and a simple yet stunning interpretation of 'Smile.' ",5.0
" Well she's done it again - gone & impressed the hell out of me just by being herself. I feel that this is Barbra at the most comfortable I've ever seen on stage comfortable with her life her self and her place in history. The woman is truly remarkable and while yeah there's a little showing of age on a note or two (and a 'senior moment' which I got a good laugh at even though I'm not!) - there's still no mistaking that unbelievable talent there for the taking. An amazing performance - her voice gets stronger through the performance and I highly recommend this brilliant concert to anyone who wants to hear a legend perform. Very much worth the money you might spend on this product and I only hope that there is a DVD release planned as well. ",5.0

That is what is wrong with the world today...nasty vindictive jealous people. Now my review? I LOVED this CD. Yes Barbra's voice has matured but 'oy' the range is still there she belted and she massaged the lyrics like I have never heard.

Hearing her sing SOMEWHERE makes you realize that this is one lady who is not going to grow old. Her voice is still as pure and powerful as it was when she appeared on Broadway in FUNNY GIRL and that was over 40 years ago!I was lucky to see her perform twice (Timeless in 2000 and this concert in 2006). It is not a joke or abject flattery when I say her voice is actually getting better with age. Everything from her toning to her song selections are perfect.Bravo Barbra! ",5.0

" Like anyone else reading this I am a huge Barbra fanand have been since I first saw the 'Funny Girl' movie.For 40 years I've been thrilled amused moved occasion-ally disappointed charmed and awed by her talent.I saw her in concert in 1994 at Madison Square Gardenand it was one of the concert thrills of my life. Hervoice still had such power and magnificence and toexperience it as it actually emanated from her vocalcords and into my ears was just a dream come true.After that I never tried to get tickets to see heragain because I knew it could never be better thanthat time. BUT listening to this CD I regretnot going to see her last year. Is her voice better?Absolutely not. As has been discussed in the otherreviews there are signs of aging that you simplycannot hide. A bit of huskiness in the lower regis-ter and those once-effortless high notes requirea lot more effort. There is simply no comparing thepower of her voice 30 years ago with the way shesounds now. HOWEVER I think we need to focus onwhat her voice still IS. It is still a beautifulinstrument more expressive than most other singersout there. That lush Streisand tone has only gottenricher IMHO. Such a sound! And what Mother Naturehas diminished has been more than made up for bythe grace humor and sublime interpretive skillsthat Barbra displays now as much as ever...maybe more.I wasn't prepared to be so moved by this recording.It sounds like she's having the time of her life andthe song selection includes many songs she hasn'tsung in years. The humor and brass of 'Down With Love'and the bittersweet regret of 'Have I Stayed TooLong At The Fair' are just two highlights. (I thinkher special guests Il Divo are dreadful but whatever.)I also think that this version of 'The Way We Were' isby far her best live one. After all these years tobreathe new meaning into that old warhorse....wellthat's what we call 'art'. If you're expecting the'Broadway Album' voice you may be disappointed. Butif you want to hear a singer so alive and geniune thatit will give you a lump in your throat buy this.It's a keeper. A+!! ",5.0

" The VERY VERY few who have expressed dissatisfaction with the Live in Concert 2006 CD clearly do not have the expertise to qualify Barbra as an artist and singer. Furthermore I was present at her performance in Atlanta and must say that I too was anxious about her vocals knowing the she had aged since the first time I saw her live in 1994 and in 2000.The truth is that her vocals her are absolutely astonishing even by her own standards. Perhaps the tracks chosen for this CD were not as demonstrative of her power 'in person' but I would say without hesitation that she is in better voice here than in 2000- NO doubt about it. Those who saw or heard her then will definitely agree. And no her voice is not the perfect powerhouse that it was 30 years ago but damn close to it.Hands down when compared to her peers (how many are there?) Barbra is second to none with her success in the music industry. The statistics prove that she remains one of the most lauded and awarded performers in history- and is STILL on stage singing; and not to mention selling out stadiums the world over!

With this concert possibly being her last concert tour I was really bummed out that I could not go (and very angry when I found out I would be in Chicago exactly one week after her concert there). When I found out that a CD for the concert tour would be released I was ecstatic but wondered 'Would this CD really live up to my crushed dream?'Well as you can see by how many stars I gave this CD it definitely surpassed my expectations (and believe me my expectations were pretty high).

" Even though I saw Ms. Streisand Live in Atlanta last year I cannot believe how great this Cd is! It is not only Barbra Streisand best live album it is also the best live concert album by any artist except maybe with the exception of Judy Garland's Live at Carnegie Hall album. Streisand has never sounded so happy and relaxed! One gets to hear songs that she's never recorded and one's she hasn't sang in decades like 'Down With Love' and 'Have I Stayed Too Long At The Fair' the latter will send chills up your spine. There are classics like 'People' was a rare introduction! There is also her special guest LL Divo. They join Barbra on 'The Music of The Night' and 'Evergreen' but it is there duet with Streisand on 'Somewhere' the is absolute perfection! Just wait to you hear the song from Broadway's Nine 'Unusual Way' wow Barbra nails it! I just cannot stop listening to this CD! One final note it is packaged so well. Has a great cover that opens up and has a fill color slip cover tucked inside. You know to think about it I think Streisand Live is equal to Garland's Carnegie Hall album. Both are masterpieces that will live on forever! ",5.0
" Well I can now die my life is complete! I saw the concert in L.A. got the $40 T-Shirts & have the CD's; I say CD's because the one sold at Target has two bonus tracks which are 'Stoney End' & the short-lived Funny Girl Medley with the full version of 'Don't Rain on My Parade' that was at the end of the first act of the show. Then the Barnes & Noble version with the bonus track of 'When The Sun Comes Out.' There is no version that includes 'Woman In The Moon' unfortunately. The recording quality is simply stunning. Subtle and powerful. Rich and Spartan. Thundering and Mellifluous. I'm marveling in Barbra's newfound enjoyment of singing live which is evident in her exchanges with the audience. and when I crank it up sit back and close my eyes it almost sounds and feels as it did on November 20th. It was worth the wait in my opinion as it only fed the monster which is anticipation. I still had the music of that night in my head which I will have always. What I like most about this live set is hearing songs that she hasn't sung as well as songs she's not done since the 60s 'Have I Stayed Too Long At The Fair' & 'When The Sun Comes Out.' There are moments in both when one would swear that no time has passed and that it's 1965 vocally speaking she sounds that good! But to hear her sing 'Too Long At The Fair' with 40+ years of life experience behind it is truly at once magical and mesmerizing but ultimately poignent. I've been a fan for more than 35 years and this is the most accesible I think she's ever been. Since she's announced a full 2007 Summer European Tour I think it's safe to say that we can expect another 'Streisand Live In Europe 2007' CD/CD's. Run don't walk to buy this Barbra release. You are in for ear candy of the most delicious kind. ",5.0
" Yeah yeah yeah... a lot of people say that she's lost that amazing voice that she can't sing anymore... don't you believe that. She is more than a singer she is a performer. Her voice is still the best and she makes a fantastic use of it. The arrangements and orchestration are brilliant and reminds me of Sinatra's. Listen to the bonus track When the sun comes out and you'll understand. Compare this performance to the earlier in her carrier almost 50 years ago. She sounds better today as incredible as it may sound. ",5.0

" I don't agree with Barbra's politics but I absolutely adore her voice her acting ability her presence and the way she brings class elegance and sophistication to everything she does. Her voice has darkened deepened and has a 'dusky' and 'husky' quality to it now and she doesn't have quite the resonance and brilliance that she had even 10 years ago but even so her voice is still incredibly rich and smooth. And she can still belt a high note like no one's business. She works magic with each and every song she sings completely enthralling the listener. Especially magical and beautiful are 'The music of the night' and 'Somewhere' both of which she sings with the Pop/Opera group 'Il Divo'. The sound of her voice interwoven with theirs especially at the climax of each song is yet again beautiful magical and exhilarating. But of course Barbra is all of those things when she sings alone as well.She sings for us some of the staple songs of her long career such as 'The way we were' 'Evergreen' (which she also does with Il Divo and in a variety of different languages) and 'People'. She also sings for us some songs from early in her career such as 'Have I stayed too long at the fair?' which is one of my personal favorites. She also treats us to a whole string of songs from 'Funny Girl' some from the movie and some from the stage version that didn't make it into the film. We are also privileged to get to hear her briefly play the piano and then sing for us the very first song she ever wrote 'Ma premiere chanson'. In this recording she seems very relaxed and amicable towards the audience as opposed to past times when she perhaps was more nervous and tense.The arrangements and orchestrations of each song are so beautiful and elegant and sophisticated and grand...just like Barbra. Her style is inimitable her voice is perfect and she is truly a living legend. ",5.0
" This is one of the best CD's of all her concerts. I was lucky enough to go to her concert in Los Angeles and it was fantastic. The CD makes you feel as if you are there listening to her wonderful voice. ILDivo performs and I highly recommend it to anyone who is a Streisand fan. ",5.0
" This is in so many ways a remarkable recording. Besides that the album is also an essential historical document. Throughout these two discs we hear one of the preeminent vocalists of our time proving beyond a doubt that she still has it.It's remarkable how Streisand uses that instrument of hers. Yes age is creeping up with her but the voice still sends a shiver down your spine. (Play the album both loudly and softly and you'll be stunned both ways.)Many of her previous live performances seemed on record anyway as forced and insincere. This set shows Streisand at her warmest...her love and respect and gratitude to the audience is as sincere as it can get. Needless to say the warmth the audience gives her is evident too.It's remarkable too how in those few spots where she hits what Sinatra used to call 'clams' (a bad or missed note) the note is left in. I don't know how much overdubbing or splicing was done for this set but to my ears it seems as if it's the real deal.There are only two sides to this set to me. One is that it is over too quickly. Thank heavens for the repeat button on a CD player. The other quite honestly is Il Divo. Granted I could never stand them...they represent the phoniness that Simon Cowell thinks is musical talent and should have been left off the CD. 'The Music of the Night' is a mess except for Streisand's vocal which is remarkably close to the 1993 studio version. 'Somewhere' isn't much better. Even when Streisand's voice slightly cracks in the song it's lightyears ahead of what those guys can do. They're not up to this elegent affair...and from the start I wondered why she chose them as an opening act. Why not get the real things such as Michael Crawford or Johnny Mathis?Even some Streisand fans will admit that some of their Streisand albums stay on the shelf for a long time between plays...but this will likely not be one of them. I've already played it twenty or so times in one week. Terrific documentation of a legend still in her prime. ",5.0
" I was Lucky enough to have attended her Concert here In Los Angeles and Barbra Just gets Better and Better. When you Compare this Cd to her Live Cd from Her 1994 Concerts  you can tell that she is Now Very Comfortable Performaning Live and She sings like she sang at the Bon Soire when she was 21 years old only better! What is great about this 2 cd set is that many of the songs(I believe 15 songs) have actually never been on any of her live cd's and many of these songs she hasnt sang live in Decades! I also like that in this cd set they include barbra talking between songs which is great because barbra is hilarious! I cannot wait for her next concert tour(and you know there will be one)! I Love you Barbra! ",5.0

" I first saw Barbra live in 1994. She was so nervous holding on to that microphone for dear life and sticking to the script about 90% of the time. And she was magnificent. The power! The presence! I think the last note of 'On A Clear Day..' is probably still traveling. I couldn't imagine what she must have been capable of in her 20's and 30's. In 1998 she married James Brolin and things changed for her. The security of being loved can do wonderful things for the psyche. It was evident in the 'Timeless' concerts of 2000 and even more so in 2006. Gone is the stage fright. The woman is taking off her shoes waving to people joking taking questions from the audience playing the piano and wearing her glasses...in public! It's like the Invasion of the Body Snatchers. What have you done with our Barbra! What a joy to see her this way. What a joy to see her enjoying her gifts and the people who love her.Is the voice the same? No. She's 65; it can't be like it was in 1994 or even in 2000 for that matter. She can't hit those power notes anymore. But like a great pitcher who has lost his overpowering fastball she's getting them out with guile and finesse. As an interpreter of popular songs only Sinatra was her equal. What she does here is awesome. Listen to her 'Have I Stayed Too Long At The Fair' sung for the first time since the 60's but this time with all that 40 years of living can bring to it. Listen to 'Unusual Way'. At Madison Square Garden the audience with me sat in pin-drop silence hanging on every word. Listen to 'Funny Girl' or 'Come Rain or Come Shine'. Every song a revelation. There is no one like her and may never be. It happens once. Enjoy the 'new' Barbra. Not like the 'old' Barbra. But everything you could want. Has she still got it? Yeah. ",5.0

" Barbra Streisand is pop music's greatest voice. No doubt about it. At 65 she can still sing better than anyone else. This CD is no exception.My complaints---they used very 'tame' vocals when putting together this CD. Seeing her perform in Chicago was the time of my life my dream. Barbra REALLY LET GO in concert singing and peforming her heart out. While she sounds great here they used tamer vocals",5.0
" This is Barbra Streisand at her most sublime. Here we have a very relaxed Barbra finally at peace with herself and her audience. She coyly asks 'Please forgive my imperfections'... not that there's much her adoring fans need to forgive her for in the first place.Barbra tackles songs she hasn't sung in years; most beautifully on 'Have I Stayed To Long At The Fair?' She cleverly combines 'Carefully Taught' from Rodgers and Hammerstein's 'SOUTH PACIFIC' with 'Children Will Listen' from Stephen Sondheim's 'INTO THE WOODS.' When Barbra climbs the scale to hit a huge high note in 'Starting Here Starting Now' she sounds as if she's climbing a musical Mount Everest. That is in effect exactly what she IS doing and yes she can and still does hit those huge high notes when she needs to.This concert begins with the Original Broadway Overture from 'FUNNY GIRL' my favorite Streisand show. That gave me a huge thrill and a few chills. All the songs from 'FUNNY GIRL' (both Original Broadway and Film Version) move me tremendously. She is so fresh singing 'People' here it's as if she's singing it for the first time. For the record she first sang it in 1964.Before singing 'Somewhere' from 'WEST SIDE STORY' Barbra simply but strongly says 'Whatever the era hate accomplishes nothing.'Although Barbra will never equal JUDY GARLAND in my opinion I'm happy that Barbra finally seems happy at last just being Barbra. I certainly don't want her to be anybody else. ",5.0
" I just finished listening to the concert and one word pops in mind AMAZING. It was as wonderful as i expected it to be yeah she couldn't hit some of the high notes like she used to on some songs but so what lol.In my opinion the way she sounded singing 'Somewhere' in this tour is in my opinion the best she has ever sang the song live I love the song and I love her! her voice has such power to it...and another thing i love is try and name 1 other female performer who can do nothing but simply walk out onstage and have the entire audience on their feet for a standing ovation i can't think of anyone else..I cannot wait till the DVD for this tour is released if we are all lucky maybe it will be the show where she told her heckler to SHUT THE F*CK UP!

" Barbra Streisand for over 46 years has been an entertainer beyond words. Her 2006 tour and subsequent 2007 European tour are sell out sensations. This CD captures part of her performance which is quite powerful. The stage presence alone is numbing the vocals are rich deep and so moving.

Joe is actually thinking of leaving and moving on to someplace where he can do some actual police work when the mayor of East St. Louis in Illinois asks the mayor of St. Louis to loan him a police officer who has had experience in apprehending serial killers.Joe is the logical choice and he jumps at the chance to find out who is killing pregnant women and ripping out their fetuses. When Joe sets up his new office there are two such killings and he knows it is only a matter of time before there is a third. He is paired off with police officer Marc Jeeter an idealistic man who badly wants catch this maniac and put him and put him in a cage but that won't be an easy take because there are political forces at work with a different agenda.Robert J. Randisi is an author who knows how to write an excellent police procedural. He shows a step-by-step investigation in progress and the reader gets so caught up in it that he can't put the book down until he learns how it all turns out.

" EAST OF THE ARCH is the third installment in the Joe Keough detective series from master story teller Robert J Randisi. Considering moving on in his career Joe's mind is changed when he is loaned out by his boss the mayor of St. Louis to investigate a serial killing spree that is occuring there. Keough has assigned to him a 'task force' consisting of a young Mark Twain quoting dective Marc Jeter( who I would like to see teamed up with Keough again) and their 'girl Friday' Jenny Sykes. The three begin the investigation of a serial killer who is killing pregnant women. Also showing up from Joe's past is Valerie Speck and the boy Brady who were involve in Keough's first case in St. Louis and the IA detectives Mason & Gail who are still out to get Keough any way they can. Add a seperate murder to the mix and once again Randisi weaves a first rate mystery. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND EAST OF THE ARCH and hope there are many more Randisi Joe Keough books coming out. ",5.0
" She was the voice of Hacker and Felix but i prefer she like the voice of Miss Kittin!A real good CD with only nice tracks.At the beginnig the sound is too similar to the new one of Felix (Davin Dazzle e the Neon Fever another nice album in anycase!) but one you arrive into the Allergic Soundtrack of Now Dubt about me and Clone me (Techno ghotic dark) the sounds become more electronic (sounds likes more Herbert or Dani Siciliano).My personal favorite songs is Happy Violentine.Very particular I come.com (psychedelic technology lonely song)A tribute to the French language in 3eme secle (another similar with the CD of Felix where the French tribute is with Romantique...).But even with all this 'her music history' the final resoult of the CD it's great ",5.0

" It is hard nowadays to find recordings of Ronald Stevenson's music but fortunately this cd gives us his most important work. John Ogdon recorded this work (I bet it never made it to the states!) which should also be restored to the catalog as well as Stevenson's other recording of this plus other pieces which he and other artist has recorded. This is Marc-Andre Hamelin type stuff a 80 minute single movement piece (not as long as Maw's Odyssey for orchestra but close). However Raymond Clarke proves to be a formidable talent. I hope that there will be more recordings to come of his playing but this disc is now 5 years old (I really am sorry I missed it back then) and as far as I know he has not issued any other recordings. If you are a Shostakovich fan you probably would think that the composer himself used the theme in all its permutations. However Stevenson goes farther in assuming the themes many moods by many transformations. Much virtuosity is needed as well as extreme sensitivity and Clarke succeeds with aplomb. The only reservation is the clausterphobic sound quality. I got used to it and what is more important the music carried me away which is really what a recording is about. ",5.0
" This is a fascinating work monumental in design and content within the Mahlerian universe of storming the heavenswhere music should represent the complexity of the world and one way of proceeding is a work exclaiming itself in sheer durational length.Mahler of course was speaking of the Symphonie and duration was a problematic for the late Romantic aestheticbut here Stevenson makes the creative situation forever more complex by summoning the services of the piano. The piano by comparison has not the timbral dimension nor colour of the orchestra. Ronald Stevenson was born in BlackburnLancanshire in 1928 England of Scottish and Welsh descent. And his music reflects a lifelong affinity for the tradition of folk or a melos that remains close to the voiceclose to the basic elements of culture.He was somewhat Left leaning with a streak of Scottish nationalism in his blood. However in no way is that a facile perspectivein fact it is a creative situation frought with a new set of problematics. England recall was somewhat insolated from the twin revolutionary musics on the continent the glorious ballet scores of Stravinsky and the dodecaphonic innovations of Schoenberg. Stevenson music's never involved itself with this language however he was involved with the set of problematics of composition was the first to instigate for instance interest in the music of Ferruccio Busoni an innovator in his own right. Stevenson was himself as Busoni a marvelous pianist. He had always complained of the 'product-line' pianism that was an integral part of the concert world the builiding of repertoire for the momentrather than a life's devotion toward a particular creative agenda. The Passacaglia is a time attenuated and honed genre in which the creator either triumphs or are left in diminution of what was.There are precedents here I recall Stephan Wolpe's piano Passacaglia comes to mine as a profound workbut no where near as long as the Stevenson.By comparison Stevenson sets an oratorio-like gesture for the pianowhereas Wolpe was a mere intervallic displayas fascinating as that is. The DSCH motive is a dedication to Dmitri Shostakovich and the derivation of the tones comes from the German spelling S is E-flat H is B-natural B refers to B-flat it is a motive that appears frequently in the music of Shostakovich the Eighth String Quartet for instance. Stevenson at 32 years of age began work in West Linton the village south of Edinburgh in December1960 and was completed in May1962.A bound copy was presented to Shostakovich during the Edinburgh Festival. The work progresses sometimesmysteriously sometimes arduouslylumberedbrooding you feel the rhythmic weight of this motive many times. But then there are variations which reach for the heavens with mists of scales and arpeggios ascending or other comments as afterbeats after the primary motive. The work is tonal based yet extended wherever possible it seems as means of contextual escape.Stevenson finds his voice within toanlity in this work as no other. The piece's content is that it progresses over an agenda of continuous development this long a structural concern of this century. Recallthat developmental variations was like the end point of structure the late and post-romantics engaged in in particular the music of Johannes Brahms proceeding up to Schoenberg reaching culmination with the diamond-cut private gestures of Anton Webernhis Variations for Piano is seemingly the endpoint of this tradition. Stevenson brings an encyclopedic-like compendium of musical formsan affinity for traditional form here dividing the work into Episodes each episode progressing quite differently with its own array of these forms.The First functions much like a Sonata Allegro. We also have preludesarabandepolonaisegavotteand the strum of the inside piano strings is an arresting gesture heregiven Stevenson's relative conservative musical language. The Second Episode for instance engages in 'arabesque variations' dispensing with the Baroque proceduresthen a 'drumming' section framed in an Etude-like form which identifies the center of the work.There is then a 'Dies irae and is marked 'in memoriam the six million' Toward the final pages Stevenson reamrkable how he can restrain himself for the ending pages where Variations on the Russian 'PeaceBread and The Land'occurs which is an ostinato rhythm implied by the Russian slogan of 1917 Mir Khleb i Zemlya. This implies a point of reconstruction and renewal.So points of lament and points of hope and triumph compliment each other profoundly. Stevenson (dissimilar to many Western scholars) shares the view that Shostakovich believed in the socialist system. He may have not honored its opportunist leadersyet he harbored this belief all his lifethe belief in freedom from exploitation. There are other rich contextual associations here as well the song 'To Emergent Africa' included in the final pages herethis a controversial passage indeed when performed by Stevenson himself at the premiere in 1963 in Cape Town South Africa. Raymond Clarke the remarkable pianist here Herculean actually in his efforts also provides his own comprehensive jacket notes.I found his playing reserved and less than impassioned at timesclaiming the works control and clarity prior to passionate display. There is only one reference to Stevenson's Scottish ancestry here it was actually written last in 1963 a seventeenth century lament 'Cumha na Cloinne (Lament of the Children). This is the fifth of the 17 sections. ",5.0

" Okay it's not *actually* an opera but this classic alternative rock album from the late '70s is a single story told through some exceptional orchestrated rock. I owned a vinyl LP copy back in the day wore out a cassette copy and recently rediscovered the CD.The story of 'Hope' is an analogy to the human experience on earth told through a series of songs about those no-long-existing beings on the planet 'second from the sun.' One can enjoy the music at several levels; as stand-alone classic alternative rock excellently produced (a la Alan Parsons Project before they were around) or one can dig deeper and get into the message and clever writing within the thematic message of 'Hope.'My favorites include the Politzanian national anthem embedded in 'Politzania' 'The Loneliest of Creatures' a wonderful space-choral piece 'Around the Universe in 80 Days...' Pretty much the whole thing. I rarely listen to bits of this album and tend to prefer it on long drives when I can enjoy the whole thing. ",5.0
" Klaatu's 2nd album 1977's 'Hope' is simply a symphonic rock masterpiece. It is unlike anything else Klaatu recorded and possibly unlike anything else you've ever heard. If you like Queen's 'A Night at the Opera' Renaissance's 'Scheherazade & Other Stories' Supertramp's 'Crime of the Century' or The Alan Parson Project's 'I Robot' you may also like Klaatu's 'Hope' although it is not quite like any of these albums.Klaatu's 1st album 1976's 'Klaatu' (aka 3",5.0
" I just bought the original LP (still sealed!) from Canada (through ebay) and I can't wait to get my Rega turntable to caress this one. Of course I have the Bullseye CD but being a bit on the nostagic side these days... you know. The music is very dramatic powerful beautiful and meaningful. A prog-rock-sympho-opera gem! ",5.0
" this is a strange album i never liked it on vinyl and well the capitol cd and these new releases of this album dont do it any justice. the canadian bullseye releases of these albums are really fantastic.it makes this stange little rock opera almost magical.it no wonder people were led to believe(by capitol records)that these guys were the beatles because the music is very beatle like but only a bit more instrumental than the fab four were.any not the latter beatles but the pscyodelic mid sgt pepperbeatles.however i could not see the mystery reunited beatles doing this type of music in the late 70s early 80s when these albums came out.

" I remember when this came out; I was in college at the time. I had no awareness of this group then (I was absorbed in acid rock and the Grateful Dead - hey it was college!) but an acquaintance turned me on to this and I have loved it since.This record (now CD) is an unsung prog-rock classic that's long been overshadowed by its more popular musical brethren. I do hear influences from SuperTramp Emerson Lake & Palmer and Pink Floyd. However this is also a coherent musically multi-layered concept album that packs an emotional punch and transcends its influences.The general idea is that a space-traveling race journeys to a solar system and encounters the wreckage of the planet Klaatu a metaphorical stand-in for Earth. The only remnants are a laser-beam lighthouse adrift in the asteroid belt manned by a single person. The disc is a musical account of the destructive fall of Klaatu's once-great civilization Politzania and the space travelers' encounter with the dying lighthouse keeper.The message resonates if you give it a chance. It also has stunning relevance today. If you don't see the similarities between Klaatu's fictional Politzania and Bush's America then I have to assume you're A) a Republican; B) a musical snob. The tunes 'So Said the Lighthouse Keeper' and 'Hope' are probably among the most moving pieces of music ever to come out of the prog-rock milieu.This disc will always have a place in my CD collection. I am so glad it's back in print. If you're interested enough to have read this review you owe it to yourself to get this. ",5.0

" I purchased 'Required Etiquette' for one reason which I'll get to in a minute but as it turns out it is an excellent sampler of garage rock bands recorded by the Etiquette label. I really enjoyed the stuff by the Wailers Galaxies and Paul Bearer and the Hearsemen. But of course the Sonics are really heads and shoulders above all of these garage outfits and I really bought this CD for one song",5.0
" This disc focuses on the mid-1960s output of Seattle/Tacoma WA's Etiquette Records which was managed and run by the first great rock band out of that region The Wailers.Like the group the label produced a number of lean mean 45s influenced equally by the British Invasion (read Animals early Rolling Stones Pretty Things) and the classic American R&B; of the period. The label was the initial home of the legendary Sonics and the disc showcases alternate versions of some of their most well-known songs (check out the slide guitar on 'The Witch'); however there were other great groups in the area at the time and this disc gives you a good sample of what the scene was like (ex. Paul Bearer and the Hearsemen 'I've Been Thinking'.)For those familar with the Sub Pop label that documented Seattle's scene in the late '80s and early '90s this disc shows that scene's roots admirably. Definitely worth picking up if you are into 1964-66 garage music. ",5.0

" Along with Erkel and Abranyi Mihaly Mosonyi (1815-1870) is one of the elite Hungarian composers of the nineteenth century although better known in his country than in other European regions. His music might not have reached international fame but Liszt's approbation for his compositions is well-worth considering. Mosonyi showed Liszt gratitude in many ways the most exemplary being his prodigious and impressive transcription of Liszt's 'Gran Mass' for four hands. The beautiful and fervent music combined with Istvan Kassai's and Klara Kormendi's electrifying performance is enough to earn this Marco Polo release a solid five stars.Some of Mosonyi's own compositions however are included beside his transcription of Liszt's 'Gran Mass.' The 'Grand Duo' is essentially a piano sonata for four hands. Writing to the Hungarian composer Kornel von Abranyi Liszt said 'Many of [Mosonyi's] Hungarian pieces remain classical as opposed to the current wares...' Compared to contemporary works around 1847 the Grand Duo indeed sounds like something 'between Viennese classicism and early Viennese romanticism' as the liner-notes writer says. The first movement is virtuosic and melodious perhaps best described as a cross between Moscheles and Schubert. The middle movement an innocent Allegretto has occasional moments of Romantic lyricism and beauty but the 'Vivace' last movement certainly looks back to Classicism and even to the aesthetics of Beethoven. The 'Three Colours of Burning Love' a collection of three miniatures are not that interesting but Mosonyi's 'Festival Music' scores better with its Hungarian Rhapsody-like structure and mood.Mosonyi's transcription of Liszt's 'Gran Mass' is the triumph of this recording. The Mass was written around 1855 for the 'dedication of the Esztergom Cathedral' in Hungary. According to Humphrey Searle 'This work caused considerable discussion at the time; Liszt was accused of imitating Wagnerian methods in it and even of trying to 'smuggle the Venusberg in church music.'' Those who have heard the Mass know the work contains many exciting and gorgeous ideas. Liszt's enthusiasm for the Mass and the recurrence and reworking of motifs in each movement make for compelling music. Douglas Townsend points out that 'The principal theme of the 'Agnus Dei' of Liszt's [Gran Mass] incidentally is announced by the basses and was inspired by Mosonyi's playing.' This four hand arrangement resounds with strength and captures all of the drama and introspection of the choral work. Dr. Dezso Legany the liner-notes writer shares a similar view",5.0
" This was my son's first Melissa & Doug puzzle; he received it for his first birthday. Over a year later it's still in excellent shape despite sticky toddler fingers teething and a very active cat who has a grudge against all things made of tree pulp. The colors are vibrant and as other reviewers have said the picture beneath the number doesn't match the color of the number adding another layer of complexity for children (and adults since the 6 and 9 are largely interchangeable). The puzzle helps him with his counting and number recognition and is well-made and of durable construction. I would recommend that a 1-year old might do better with the M&D; chunky puzzles (of which we also have a multitude) to start with simply because the pegs are a little tough for tiny fingers to grasp until the fine motor skills improve. Also the numbers are narrow and disappear easily under furniture - we only just found the 3 hiding under a loveseat this week; I was sure he had thrown it away during a 'helpful' spell! ",5.0

There is a sense of humor to some of these photos too which makes looking at them even more entertaining. This is a perfect companion to Water Light Time! ",5.0

" if there's one thing i'm sure of it's that this album is amazing. aside from the fact that Frisell's arrangements were NOT built on those of Costello and Bacharach (at least not their finished versions) the Sweetest Punch is a very pleasent listen. it is ridiculous to believe that Frisell could not have 'added' something to the songs since he put all the flesh onto the originally skeletal pieces he received. and about the strange sound noted by one reviewer that's frisell-style for ya....lots of wavering chorus. good job bill and crew.

" This was a can't-miss concept and the result was even greater than I assumed it would be. Frisell proves himself as an imaginative orchestrator never heavy-handed.

This package includes a biography book with a lot of pics of BA with other rock stars such as Sting Bono and Tina Turner just to name a few. ",5.0
" I enjoyed this book thoroughly. The four biographies were wonderful and deepened my understanding of the bebop era and what life is like for career musicians. I was at first drawn to this book because of the biography of Herbie Nichols; I own the complete works of Herbie Nichols on CD but until I read this book only knew that he was unappreciated during his lifetime. Now I really understand Mr. Nichols and my respect for him and ability to appreciate his music is much deeper. Same for Ornette Coleman who until I read his biography here was to my mind merely an eccentric who had helped ruin the commercial viability of jazz. Thanks to this book I now understand how sincere and committed and courageous Ornette Coleman was. I bought this book on Amazon about a month ago and I do not understand why Amazon lists it a month later as 'out of print'. I urge anyone who wants to deepen his/her understanding of jazz music to read this wonderful book. People who want to learn jazz can no longer simply go to 52nd Street in NYC and learn from the masters directly. Books such as this book videos and CD's are the only way for the current and future generations to learn about the golden age of jazz. Thus this book is *essential* for a sincere student of jazz. The book's high quality is worthy of the heavy responsibility it thus bears. By the way in the course of the four biographies it contains a lot of fascinating detailed insights about Theolonius Monk Miles Davis and Charlie Parker. ",5.0

" I won't go into the technical detail of this product as you can find reviews all over the net. But as a user of Premiere Pro 6 I was looking for something more updated to handle HD content even better and has tight integration with sound and effects providing software. I narrowed the search down to Premiere Pro CS3 and Sony's Vegas Pro 8.Both are great products and would serve a pro/pro-am filmmaker or home video tinkerer equally well. I decided on the Premiere Pro CS3 product basically due to the tight integration with other Adobe products such as After Effects CS3 Photoshop CS3 Extended SoundBooth CS3 etc. Sony knits well with Cinescore and I really like Cinescore but the various Adobe software suites really can provide you with a complete production studio.I liked Premiere Pro CS3 so much that I invested in the CS3 Master Collection a bit pricey (as are all of Adobe products for some reason) but in my opinion and for the film projects that I am working on (semi-pro) the investment is well worth it. If you have some technical abilities a desire to learn the software packages and are willing to hone your craft (artistic as well as technical) you can be a 1 person professional production studio. Some of the end results that I have produced with the CS3 suites and a pro-sumer HDV camera are indistinguishable from a production that has spent hundreds of thousands or more on post-production including some eye popping special effects.I give it 5 stars because Premiere Pro CS3 is at the top of the game. The only real cons I have found so far are A) the price and B) it is a huge memory user. The minimum requirements say you need at least 1 GB of memory and they mean it. Optimally you should have more than that for video production of this caliber. I'd say at least 3 GB is prime. 4 or more is gravy. ",5.0

The savvy conductor (new to me) is Dominique My and she clearly knows what to do with Rihm's nervous glittering opus.Although the work is conceived in a single unbroken movement (about 45 minutes long) the disc includes track numbers to easily locate individual sections to help the listener grasp the work's structure according to the notes. The track numbers also help to quickly locate a particular section.This is a bracing new composition and easy to recommend to anyone wanting a fast energy-packed listening experience. The virtuosic playing -- good on its own -- and intelligent conducting are complemented by DG's excellent sound that enables all of Rihm's gestures to be audible. For some who complain that 'no good music is being written today' this outstanding recording begs to differ. ",5.0
" This Deutsche Grammaphon disc--part of the '20/21' series of contemporary music recordings--contains Wolfgang Rihm's great piece 'Jagden und Formen' performed by the Ensemble Modern conducted by Dominique My. Here the German composer characteristically blends the avant-garde tradition with echoes of German romanticism especially concerned with the idea of a 'hunt' for form all resulting in an exhilarating work that is among the strongest entries in the '20/21' series yet.In the 1990s Rihm wrote three pieces which explored the concept of form 'Gejagte Form' (1995-1996) 'Gedraengte Form' (1995-1998) and 'Verborgenne Formen' (1995-1997). He later collected these together to form 'Jagden and Formen' ('Hunts and Forms') yet this is not a mere hour-long concert of each piece in succession. Instead Rihm weaves them together so that 'Gejagte Form' serves as the skeleton of the work appearing five times first on two violins out of phase with each other strings flutes clarinents and harp then on woodwinds then on horns and trumpets a fourth time on horns and trombones and a last time for strings and piano. In between these structral elements the piece abounds with unexpected turns build-ups that fall when the 'quarry' eludes the musicians/hunters moments of uncertainty and even the occasionally lyric or engine-like passage. Suspense is constant; rarely does contemporary repertoire many of whose godfathers (I'm thinking especially of Webern) were compelled to keep their pieces short offer an hour-long work that never lets the audience's attention wander. Furthermore Rihm's orchestration highlighting winds percussion (especially the marimba) harp and guitar over the usual strings results in a use of colour as exotic as anything in Messiaen.The performance is remarkable. In a work based on the idea of motion Dominique My never lets up the pace and the orchestra never takes a wrong step. My only complaint is that the recording though crystal-clear doesn't really explore the studio space as it should; having seen 'Gedraengte Form' in concert I think the piece sounds better with room to breathe. The liner notes are good too containing a musicological analysis of the piece along with an interview with Rihm where he defends his work with the kind of zany quips that we've come to love. And though it feels somewhat dirty to praise the graphic design when the music is what matters DG have come up with some impressive futuristic artwork.I'm very enthusiastic about 'Jagden and Formen' and think it deserves a place in the collection of any fan of contemporary music.

" Helen McLean and Abiye Cole have done an excellent job in providing an introduction to working with dreams in your personal life or as a facilitator in professional life. The fact that they repeatedly point out that there are no hard and fast rules for interpreting dreams and strongly warn against the indiscriminate use of dream dictionaries makes clear that writing a handbook about dream catching can be tricky.They have chosen to lavishly illustrate and illuminate their guidelines with examples from their experience in Gestalt dream-working. The result is a vivid book in which the numerous step-by-step analyses of real dreams give the reader a thorough understanding of mechanisms in dreaming. At the same time the authors make clear that there are no hard and fast rules to be found which can lead to an automatic interpretation of a dream.The book is very practical with lot's of tips varying from how to enhance one's capability to remember dreams to how to deal with uncomfortable images.

" This device works great! The speaker is hidden under the dash and it still sounds perfect. The microphone does not have any feedback and picks up anyone's voice anywhere in the car. The external antanne (supported but not included) is great as the typical cell phone reception in my area is weak. I also like the small personal handset for private conversations. I did my own installation but would recommend hiring it done unless you have done something like this before (tapping into the fuse box mounting hardware in a car pulling wires under the dash). A reasonable installation charge would be between $50 and $100(it's not easy). I had to purchase an additional 'post' to mount the cradle to as I could not find a suitable place to use the mount provided with the kit. This is a great unit and looks very professional when installed. Only problem is after using mine everyone else in my family wants one! ",5.0
" Poison Girls an early Crass era political peace-punk band releases a collection of past greats. From the politically diverse lyrics to the enchanting as well as beautifully sung melodies you'll find most of their best on this cd. The songs vary from type ranging from love songs like 'Promenade Immortelle' & 'Tender Love' to the sheer political madness of songs like 'Price of Grain & the Price of Blood' to the crass favorite 'Dirty Work' Anyone who likes anything creative and brilliant should definately buy this and put it in their 'i'll keep this cd in my 'Until I die'' section. Another great 'Real Woman' is just as uplifting. ",5.0
" Along with Crass the Poison Girls quickly became a foundation band for the anarcho-punk movement in the 1970s which went beyond gigs in squatted clubs and the release of material well outside the norms dictated by record companies and their close friends masquerading as 'music critics.'With Vi Subversa (guitar/vocals) and Richard Famous (guitar/vocals) the only constant members until the band called it quits in November 1989 - they briefly reunited in 1995 to celebrate the 60th birthday of Vi Subversa - the turnover in musicians seemd to provide renewable energy for the duo. Though 'Bully Boys' is not on the collection the 30 tracks is an outstanding career overview and clearly demonstrates the premium placed on exploring a wide range of topics which includes motherhood - Vi Subversa was a middle-aged mother of two when the band formed in 1976 - gender issues and the special role each person can play in thwarting the drama manipulated by the puppeteers who control career politicians.This 2-CD set is only trumped by the 4-CD 'Statement' and is a celebration of music that speaks to people of all ages who have the courage to strongly question societal norms and the voracious economic appetite of pop culture.

" I really liked Bob Vickery's earlier books and 'Play Buddies' is at least as good. Vickery writes stories that are really hot original with actual plots and well-rounded characters. When Vickery gets steamy no one get beat him and he's also just a damn good story teller. I enjoyed 'Play Buddies' a lot and I think most lovers of gay erotica will get a big kick out of Vickery's latest effort. ",5.0
" I'm a big fan of Vickery's ever since I read his previous book Cocksure. I have to say that as good as Cocksure was Play Buddies is even better! Not only are his stories hot Vickery writes with real humanity making his characters come across as real and three dimensional out on the prowl looking for sex wherever they can find it. As far as erotic writing goes Vickery is a master! ",5.0
" Vickery is certainly the best multi-dimensional male erotic fiction writer today. He is the Anne Rice of [homosexual] male porn.But even more the humanity and spirituality of his characters [comes] through clearly - their pain their joy their search their honesty the lies the hopes the hot  out-of-control passion - everything else human. I was moved to tears and compassion and much much more. Hot hot hot. ",5.0
" The towering strength of Bob Vickery is that he is at the event horizon of taking homoerotic literature-and this is literature-into main stream fiction. One cannot read 'Calcutta' or 'Elephant Men' without sensing how deeply Mr. Vickery cares about the characters who populate them. Is it sexy whoo boy but made more so by the humanity of the people. From Enid Oklahoma to the inevitable San Francisco he finds his people and gives them to us as the sexual lusting beings that they are. But he never forgets that they like us are humans.

" Tabasco and Chiapas in the 1930's - not a nice place either to live or to visit. Greene's explorations provided background and some characters for his great short novel or tale The Power and the Glory. If you are a student of fine writing read the novel first then read this to see how he gathered and used material. Or read this first for background that adds depth to the novel. If you are an armchair traveler or student of Mexico enjoy Greene's adventures and be grateful he went through them so you don't have to do it yourself. This is truly a classic of travel writing.

" The Lawless Roads is the second non-fiction travel book of Greene's that I've read and the other Journey Without Maps was also a great book about travel in Africa. Greene is a brilliant travel writer; he makes detailed observations about the countryside people and customs of Mexico. The way he traveled in the 30s makes you appreciate modern infrastructure and the advances of civilization that make godforsaken places livable. He was on assignment for a paper to report on the anti-clerical government that was persecuting the Catholics. It was form this experience that Greene wrote The Power and The Glory which germinated from an antecdote he heard in Mexico about a whisky priest while on assignment. ",5.0
" To consider writing the 'maritime history of the world' is one thing but how to go about it is something else altogether. Covering some 7000 years - i.e. from 5000BC to the present day the vast subject of the world's maritime history is set out in strict chronological order which is a great help when trying to find something specific.These two co-authors enjoy a high reputation in their field and there is no doubt that they have surpassed themselves in this exceptional and authoritative work. With a Bibliography which runs to 8 pages this enormous undertaking is set out in two volumes. The basic concept is to identify and explain those dates or periods in history when - and where significant milestones were achieved in terms of man's endeavours as far as the sea was concerned. At the beginning of Volume 1 the dates are not entirely exact - but nobody was actually keeping accurate records in 5000 BC. As we progress through the book however and on into Volume 2 so the dates do become more exact and the authors are able to include every important maritime event under it's year; Spanish Armada (1588) Battle of Trafalgar (1805) and the loss of the USS Maine (1898) to mention just 3 important dates picked at random.From the earliest floating logs to the latest and biggest ships they are all in here making this an important tool for anyone with an interest in ships and shipping.NM ",5.0

" This is an extraordinary story about optimism hope courage and perseverance. It is about finding out what is our 'mission' in life about destiny and following our dreams - whenever one wishes something the whole universe conspires to its realisation. Everything is possible as long as we really want this to happen.At the first level the story seems to be very simple and as Coelho himself said it 'simple things are the most valuable and only wise people appreciate them'. But it is by far a very complex story with very deep meanings.One of the things suggested here is that people who don't dare to follow their dreams their 'Personal Myth' will have a superficial and empty life.It is also about being courageous to meet your destiny to dare making your dreams come true and following the road that has been made for them and find God while searching for their destiny and their mission on earth.Another important issue in this book is finding your soul-mate and love - the core of existence and creation.

" Having read both this book and 'Crucial Conversations' more than once let me say that they are both worth reading more than once! In its latest reading I used this book for a book study at work guiding my team (I'm their boss) through the book and the lessons in the book. The team had been largely dysfunctional had serious problems with communication apparently had no idea of how to deal with confrontations and might very well have imploded completely. Over the course of a few months we read this book chapter by chapter (with some breaks) discussed each of the lessons and started to put them into play.Today the team communicates far better has become highly functional has improved their interpersonal skills and are a joy to work with.Several of the team said that they were already starting to put some of the things they'd learned into practice in their personal lives and I can see them applying them at work daily.The lessons that you can glean from this book are HUGE. If you find yourself struggling to have real conversations about issues small and large if you have a relationship that is in some jeopardy or if you just want to be more effective in a leadership or teaming role read these books.For instance the idea of mastering your stories... what is it that you assume about the motivations of the other person and how do those assumptions generate feelings which drive YOUR behaviors? Learning about your 'stories' how to discuss them with others and how that affects you could be the start of something wonderful for you.Read these books. Now. ",5.0

Beyond the welcome relief that comes from just cracking the code on a performance or relationship issue - these tools actually have the power to 'knock people into gear' by making visible some of the long-term (seemingly invisible) costs associated with more typical coping or carping strategies.

" 'Crucial Confrontations' is an important book because we must communicate. We are social beings who share space time and the journey of this life.Nothing is more disheartening than when someone breaks a promise violates an expectation or just behaves badly towards you. How do you respond? Some people perhaps too many just let it slide. Then what was promised becomes conveniently lost in translation. The expectation becomes a disappointment. The bad behavior reinforced.Perhaps this cycle explains the lack of accountability in American society today. Confronting someone can be hard but if you do not problems often persist and get worse. Why? Clementine Paddleford is quoted as having said 'Never grow a wishbone... where your backbone ought to be.'Interpersonal communications is skills-based. No one is so good at it that they succeed the first time every time. This axiom remains true whether you are at home in the boss's office or in the Oval Office. No one always gets everything.Perhaps it is because human beings are not omniscient that self-respect is a good premise to start with. No one wants the reputation of being a wall-flower or a door mat. Believing in your own self-worth knowing that your perception of the world matters is as valid a reason as any for engaging in a confrontation that sets your world aright.'Crucial Confrontations' is about accountability. The approach is candid and courteous; it unfolds in an environment of safety and by honoring the reality of consequences the interpersonal skills this book teaches help the reader 'bring predictability to a turbulent world.'The authors acknowledge there's nothing particularly groundbreaking in this book. We employ these communications tools when we are at our best and there are times when walking away is appropriate. 'Crucial Confrontations' reminds us how to communicate better when life goes off script.Communicating can be difficult but we do it all the time. Having a crucial confrontation may not guarantee success but it will help you stand tall and move forward on your shared journey of this life. ",5.0
" I can't praise these authors enough. In fact they are due for another book and I look forward to reading it. Having already read  'Influencer' and 'Crucial Conversation'  I knew what to expect from these excellent writers with Crucial Confrontation.General OverviewThe reasons I love these books are because at the end of each book they do a beautiful job of tying all together. For me this is extremely important. After reading 300+ pages at the end they tell you what does it all mean to me and how can I use these wonderful skills in my own life. They summarizes it all and give you specific examples that you can use NOW to become better skill person on handling high stake conversations or confrontations or influencing people or a group of people.They tell you to practice one specific skill a week until you get the hang of it. So many books spew theories and concepts and at the end say thank you very much and I hope you use what we just told you and you like what. How? where do I start? there is just too much information etc etc. On the opposite side these incredible authors tell you exactly how to use the skills they will say if there are two things you walk away from this book they are (example in this book establish safety and describe the gap) and give you examples. There is so much I can say and praise these three books and especially Crucial Confrontation( my favorite)but I say only that I strongly recommend for you to pick one up and find out for yourself.Crucial ConfrontationThere is a three concept model that you use and these are the skills that good and excellent practitioners use when there is a crucial confrontation.The model has three component of Confrontation",5.0

Like when you are driving this can be dangerous.I will most remember to pause or at least slow down when something I do or say causes and unexpected reaction that seems a bit to risk trust or cause hurt.For me this book is worth the price for helping out with just that. A good step by step in how to manage such interactions. ",5.0
" This is the second book by the same authors the first being Crucial Conversations. This book expands upon the first one by examining confrontations specifically be they at home or in the workplace (or any other place). The premise of the book is that everyone can improve their ability to handle crucial confrontations if they learn to apply specific skills. Like their first book I wish I had begun studying this one a long time ago.The authors are a group of researchers who have been studying this topic for decades. Essentially what they have done is study people who are very good at dealing with crucial confrontations and compare what these highly skilled people do that is different from everyone else. The result is a detailed step-by-step guide that teaches the principles for handling these situations so that they result in successful resolution of the problem and enhance the interpersonal relationship.Crucial Confrontations is full of examples from the author's collective case studies. These examples are integrated into every section of the book enabling the reader to immediately see the situations where the skills are put to use. Also at the end of the book the authors talk through several very difficult situations. Through it all 'Crucial Confrontations' provides some deep insights into interpersonal interactions that are very enlightening. ",5.0

" We all have confrontations to deal with in our daily lives both at work and at home. I head technology audit for a company and confrontation is a daily fact of life. Holding people accountable for actions inactions and trying to change behavior is a stressful part of many people's jobs. This book provides an effective approach to handling all aspects of confrontation.It even provides the often overlooked need for (effective) confrontation. Book illustrates this point with the example of the Challenger space shuttle tragedy (could have been averted had known issues been raised) and the tragic-comic example of a patient who went into hospital with an ear ache and came out with a vasectomy - because he wouldn't speak up!Importantly the authors provide practical approaches that can be applied in the real world in everyday life. This book's lessons can be applied in both professional and personal life. Wish I had it years ago.This is a field guide for generating postive outcomes from confrontation in all aspects of life. An excellent what when and how guide. ",5.0
" I work as a first line production manager at a Fortune 500 company. This book has helped me in developing my skills in confronting people on performance issues. Even though the book may make it seem easier than we all know it is it lays out very clear fundamental steps on what to do. I think the outline is the fundamental part we all miss when we seem to fail at crucial confrontations. This book is not the bible but if you are having issues with employees or family members not holding true to committments this book will teach you simple to follow guidelines so that the next time is more successful.

" This book has helped me to enter the sometimes scary world of teenage children. It gave me skills to keep 'in dialogue' with my children even when confronting them on 'bad behavior broken promises or failed expectations.' Since first reading this book I have practiced these skills and am getting better with my practice. I love the concept of keeping the conversation 'safe'. Its amazing that I can confront my children on issues that before they would blow up but now we are able to agree and see things the same way. I love to end with the question - Do you see it the same way or have I missed something? This helps them to know that I really have their best interests at heart. This book is a must-read for parents teachers employers and employees. It has helped me to better my relationships in all aspects of my life. ",5.0
" I saved my job by reading this book. One of my co-workers and I were having a difficult time getting along. I loved my job but this friction between the two of us was really starting to bug me and although the job market is tight right now I had decided to float my resume around and see what was out there.BUt I went to the bookstore and saw CRUCIAL CONFRONTATIONS. It had so much great advice on how to deal with confrontation in a positive way. By using the books advice I was able to 'confront' my co-worker and I realized we really were not that far apart in opinions...we just expressed them differently. It would be a stretch to say that we will be best friends but I do think we have reached a common ground and I no longer feel the need to leave my job.Go buy this book if you are have difficulty in your job. marriage or family...It is worth every penny.

" Although confrontation is difficult for many people it is often necessary. Failure to confront someone over bad behavior may be misinterpreted as approval. Confrontations can help bring people back to a better more productive course. However confrontations also can go off track and become shouting matches (or worse). Authors Kerry Patterson Joseph Grenny Ron McMillan and Al Switzler outline a method for approaching confrontations when the stakes are particularly high; those are the crucial confrontations. Boiled down to its essentials the methodology consists of focusing on facts remaining calm listening to the other person with respect and working to motivate the other person and to enable a change in behavior. The book is light anecdotal and easy to read. Yet we find that it offers so much sound advice that any manager parent or spouse could find something useful. ",5.0
" Easy to read and follow a bit repetitive but not annoyingly so this book touches on so many confrontation styles and how to have them more effectively. I thought I was pretty good at confrontations but I learned that I still could use some work. There are some really great practical ideas that can be used for home and work environments. Coming out of silence and confronting people in a honest and non-threatening way can make all of our lives easier. This is a great tool for supervisors leaders and line workers as well as parents and couples. I think everyone would benefit from reading this book. Once I'm done with my class I will be passing it around the office to whoever is interested. ",5.0

" I really enjoy this book. I am a woodworker / furniture maker and I read a lot of this style of book. The author does a fantastic job of illustrating each box and providing a bit of background on each box. The photos are all in color and very well composed.The boxes range from a tea box recovered from the harbor at the Boston Tea Party to HO Studley's over-the-top tool chest to a standard GI foot locker.The book is well-organized. There is little wood working technique described so if you are looking for a how-to book this ain't the book for you.

" Green black and white peppercorns grow like tiny grapes on the Piper Nigrum vine. Green peppercorns are picked when under-ripe. White pepper is black pepper which has been soaked to remove the outer husk. Tellicherry peppercorns are the largest black peppercorns.Tellicherry peppercorns are superior to regular store bought peppercorns. Peppercorns are believed to be indigenous to the Malabar Coast of India. They are spicier enhance the flavor of all your recipes and can take things up a notch. Of course there are still recipes where you don't want the intensity of Tellicherry peppercorns but after you taste the freshly ground flavor it is difficult to go back to using anything else.I find myself grinding the peppercorns over scrambled eggs mixing it into cheese fillings and flavored butters mixing it into fillings for Samosas using it to flavor shrimp dishes sprinkling it liberally over salads and pasta and using it in nearly every soup recipe. Don't even get me started telling you how good Tellicherry peppercorns are with potatoes salmon beef tenderloin and tequila-lime chicken. Yes I'm in love with the flavor.Make the change and you will never be able to go back to regular ground pepper. You may laugh but there are some of us who fear the thought of regular pepper. Some have even gone to the extreme of carrying their own 'Minimill Peppercorn Grinder.' This is a three-inch tall mini-mill from Spices etc that you can carry with you in a small velvet bag. Yes I plan to buy one ASAP.Fun Fact",5.0

" Sandwiched between Raff's monumental 1st 3rd and 5th symphonies we find 2 works which are much shorter in length scope and vision.Symphonies 2 and 4 are however no less enjoyable than their towering neighbors.Of Raff's 11 outings in the symphonic genre numbers 2 and 4 are unique in the fact that they are the only 2 without an accompanying title. They are also similar in the fact that the influence of Beethoven can be keenly felt throughout. It's almost as if they are in a sense Raff's homage to the great master.And what an homage they are!Don't get me wrong the writing is unmistakably Raffian through and through but Raff makes no bones about the fact that Beethoven was a major influence. In fact the opening of the final movement of symphony 4 has a DIRECT QUOTATION from the choral movement of Beethovens 9th. It is not meant to be hidden and is guaranteed to bring a smile to your face.Now as for this recording of Symphony 2 there is much to love.Chalk full of dynamite melodic and thematic material every movement is an absolute winner. No favorites here and that is a rare statement for me.The 2 overtures on this disk are very good but to be honest I'd rather stick with the main course.A stunning brilliant performance excellent recording quality and equally good liner notes earn this CD my highest recommendation.Enjoy.PS-Don't lend it to a friend. You may never get it back. ",5.0
" Janet's Peformance of her tour was fantastic!!! It was the best concert special I have ever seen and I have waited very impatiently for its release! To be honest I was expecting a little less from Janet but was astonished at her stage presence and singing ablility. I have to admit that I am a fan but even my friends who are non-fans loved this special. The stage presence theatrical setup lighting fireworks special effects costumes and that high note she during 'Again' made this concert even better than Garth's performance from Central Park. Janet gave a performance that would turn anyone's head especially when she did that lap dance...You'll understand what I mean IF YOU BUY THIS TAPE! PLEASE! Do yourself a favor and get The Velvet Rope Tour...now! ",5.0
" Even if you're not a Janet fan you'll appreciate how wonderful she is in concert. She is very athletic beautiful and has extremely powerful vocals. Her sets have to be the best in the business with playful scenes dark scenes and even a scene where she brings an audience member on to stage for a special performance. Janet changes outfits so many times you'd think she pass out from exhaustion but she keeps on pushing out all those wonderful high/low notes till the end. The sound track is also great there may be audience roars but JJ can be heard VERY easily over them; actually the crowd's yelling is sort of a bonus in that the viewer can see & hear what the audience is feeling about those same pieces (they're always applauding for more). The DVD is well assembled with a great track listing sound recording and the video is excellent as well; if you have or haven't seen Janet in concert it won't matter because this is a great DVD for the novice and experienced.

" Janet did lipsynch parts of the show but what do you expect she was was dancing up a storm. With some of the busier dance numbers she did use pre-recorded vocals but that is only because dancing and singing is the equivalent of singing while running a marathon. On songs like 'Again' and 'Go Deep' Janet did sing live. The concert was the best ever and that person is probably just jealous that they can't dance like Janet! ",5.0

The Choreography Was Really Out Of This World . I Recommend This Movie To Everybody . For 2 Hours  You Are Transformed To A World Of Magic And Excitement . I Can Guarantee That You Will Love It .

" Janet's VELVET ROPE tour began in Europe in April 1998 and lasted well into the fall of 1998 hitting various countries to support her album THE VELVET ROPE. THE VELVET ROPE is Janet's most personal offering with songs about acceptance personal pain etc. The tour is a must see. Janet takes on various personas through different costume changes that symbolize her songs. Not only does she sing songs from THE VELVET ROPE but she digs back all the way to CONTROL and RHYTHM NATION 1814 with songs the fans have always loved. As tiring as the tour is this party doesn't stop as she entertains through and through during this concert. There is a charisma with Janet on stage between her and the fans her and the dancers anyone she wants to make contact with. This is a show for the fans and a show that doesn't disapoint. Highlight performances include the Control Medley the Escapade Medley If Rhythm Nation What About and more. Give this one a whirl if you want to be entertained! ",5.0
" It's JANET! And what a DVD this is. Killer sets great dance numbers (my only complaint is that not all the dancers can be seen all the time and they're working as hard as Miss Janet. I think more on-screen time next go 'round should be afforded to these talented energetic individuals.) And Janet sings her heart out - all your favorites from 'If' to a medley of 'Control' hits to a razor-edged rendition of 'Black Cat'. The emotional song however is 'What About' with dancers in the background enacting various scenes of violence between men and women with men being the aggressors. A powerful song 'What About' only speaks more eloquently with its visuals. This DVD is never leaving my collection! Can't wait for Janet's new CD!(And there is one awesome seduction number in the song 'Rope Burn'. You know that guy onstage will never forget THAT experience! Turn that track on when you curl up with your honey one evening!) ",5.0
" This DVD is one of my all time favorite musical DVDs. Miss Jackson proves why she is the highest paid singer in the industry. With a combination of costume changes great choreography Janet's greatest hits and a sold out crowd at Madison Square Garden the DVD makes for an excellent night of entertainment. I only regret that I was not able to see the concert in person here in my home town due to a cancelation of the concert;however the DVD is definately a suitable substitute. I highly recommend this DVD to any fans of Janet lovers of music and owners of quality DVDs. ",5.0
" If you missed seeing Miss j on HBO I recommend you buy the DVD/VHS ASAP! Janet knows how to throw one hell of a show! The dancing is excellent the staging is remarkable and the dancers are great and then of course there is Janet the queen of Pop! If your seriously looking for Out-of-this-world entertainment I fully recommend you purchase your on personal copy of The Velvet Rope! ",5.0
" this tour was very person and as janet represented from the start of the concert an open book of HER story of her life music feelings and so forth. The concert begins with a big book being opened and then seperated into two screens then comes janet. She sings songs from velvet rope which are perfectly mixed with classic dance hits of hers over the years. A lot of the control and rhythm nation songs were made into medleys though some of the ones with intense choreography like If Rhythm Nation and so forth were performed wonderfully. Janet also created great new chorography for what about you and i get lonely which could have also been singles. I wish Everytime was sang on this show though that ballad is just so beautiful. It was great to see rope burn and special included. ",5.0
" In 1998 I got the rare opportunity to see Janet Jackson in concert held in Minneapolis during 'The Velvet Rope' tour. The show was amazing. All of the physical features and her performances were breathtaking. Though nothing beats the live experience this DVD wonderfully commemorates the tour.Months before she released an album of the same name that was unusually different than her previous. She was always known for her positive songs. However the album entirely explored her painful turbulations including abuse loss depression and others. These songs are based on thoughts she endured during her two-year depression 1995-1997. Many listeners were shocked. Some of these songs gave this tour a new outlook. Despite revisiting many classic songs audiences can feel her new style.The elaborate stage direction gives the concert a more enjoyable experience. The three different backgrounds and the three different costumes add to the spectacular pleasure",5.0
" I watched this concert on HBO all three times they aired it. It is truly amazing. Janet's performance was incredible. I'm a musician band leader writer producer........etc. To say that I love all kinds of music would be a HUGE understatement. Every time I watch this concert I'm blown away by how much energy Janet and her whole crew put into the show. All the singers dancers musicians and the audience was so hyped! Plus the fact that her band got to strut their stuff from time to time made my day. I also run sound (PA) for bands so I know how incredibly hard it is to mix for a live event. I thought the mix could've been a little better. At times you can barely understand Janet or her background singers. Some songs are a little clearer than others. However I can't wait for this concert to come out on VHS Laserdisc or DVD. Being the music enthusiast I am I'lll probably buy all three formats. The overall show was (is) really awesome. Everyone should own it. ",5.0

" Ms. Jackson - is definately nobody's little sister she is a woman and a very beautiful one at that - I think that it is an insult to say she is the little sister of Michael - I believe she has proven that time and time again - she is her own person. I have viewed this video each time it has aired on HBO and I must say - I have been totally mezmarized {so have my children}; her stage presence is totally awesome she gives her all and then some - her background singers and her dancers are equally incredible - the performance they all gave was heart-pounding. I have been a Janet fan since the real early days 'come give your love to me' and even earlier than that {she and I are the same age}; - no matter what you think of her or her performance you have to give the girl her props - let's face it out of all the children her parents had she's the only girl that is doing something with the gift GOD gave her not downing her sisters but I've heard them both sing and well - I'm gonna leave that alone anyway my personal opinion is that Ms. Jackson is the BOMB and even though I'm a woman I would have loved to be where that guy was sitting when she gave that lap dance to 'Rope Burn' of course that is my favorite part of the concert. Thank you Comments",5.0
" Being an avid Janet Jackson supporter I must say that her live jaunt 'The Velvet Rope live' was one of her best tours ever.. For those who think she is trying to be like Madonna they should do some homework. THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST TOUR THAT JANET JACKSON TIED UP A MAN LIVE ON STAGE... This was also not the first tour that had many of the Broadway and theatrical elements that Madonna has in many ways made famous. Madonna is not the end all of live performing and just because she may have done something first does not mean she did it best.Now this is not to say that Janet's live show is 100 percent 'never been done' but nothing in her show is exactly like Madonna ever did and anything close to what Madonna did is totally mixed in with Janet Jackson's genius and taken to another level as only Janet Jackson can take it.The show begins with a storybook opening and with one big BOOM JANET JACKSON IS UPON US. The pop diva slowly comes to the stage to perform the title track 'THE VELVET ROPE' and then BURSTS into the high charged 'if'. other stunning moments through the 2 hour jaunt included a beautiful medley of her slower hits 'let's wait a while' and 'again' and a cute 'wonderland' medley of her hits..Another issue that many find a problem is lip-synching. Although Janet does not sing songs like 'if' or 'r.nation'. over half of her live concert is just that live... from the slow songs of 'let's wait a while and again' to trob and the entire wonderland medley Janet sings live song after live song. the song 'black cat' is live as well and the final set of 'go deep together again got till it's gone and that's the way love goes' are all live... she gives a 2 hour non stop high charted performance with elements ranging from Broadway to break dancing.This Madonna/ Janet thing is really childish. They are both pop divas and although many times it may seem as if one is gleaming ideas from another. Janet Jackson's entire career and especially this career defining VELVET ROPE CONCERT is 100 percent Janet... ",5.0

" Please trust me. Trust me when I say that this is an EXCELLENT concert. Honestly I can only wish that I was in NY for it. Janet has achieved the status of 'SEXY.' Not just any singer/actress/celebrity can reach that level. Sexy means Class Maturity Beauty Strength Poise Sincerity and an ever-so-slight sense of Intimidation. To iminate all of those traits at the same time one achieves 'SEXY.' Many try and fail. Not Ms. Jackson. Many men will agree with me when I say 'I wish it were me who was brought up on stage for ''RopeBurn.'' Take Care. ",5.0
" I had the immense pleasure of seeing this extravagantly amazing stage show live and I must say it is JANET ECSTACY. Oh my god the concert was SO ACTIVE. I was up in the Forum CRYINGGGGGG!!!!!

" I love all the performances but the one that got me wilding was the lap dance. Before Britney and Rihanna ever thought of it there was Janet. The guy was having a total meltdown. He couldn't stop yapping while Janet was just looking at him like she was enjoying every bit of it! She then hushed him move a lil here and there and THEN kisses him in the end!!! I don't think I would have the courage to do it with some random guy but Janet takes risks. I really like the Special performance. Seeing all her childhood photos on the screen. I wish I was there to experience that. Seeing how big the crowd was back then it makes me wonder where are those people now? Those were the days when Janet was the HOT thing. I really miss that. She's such an underrated forgotten artist that doesn't get the credit she deserves. They need to release janet. and the Rhythm Nation tours. Those were great tours as well. Ohh..and on the side she also proves her haters wrong that she can SING live! That is all...good day! ",5.0

" I remember being 11 years old and seeing this concert when it first aired on HBO. I wasn't exactly a huge Janet fan at the time since I was too young to really get into her but I was immediately captivated by the colorful sets Janet and her dancers' tight moves and the smooth flow of the show. Janet starts from the beginning by inviting us inside her velvet rope (great concept) and revealing her sensual side with classics like If and That's the Way Love Goes her vulnerable side with Again Every Time and Special her playfulness on Go Deep and Escapade and shares her views on societal issues on Rhythm Nation and the aggressive anti-domestic violence of What About. The I Get Lonely performance as well as Rope Burn's striptease are highlights. You go through so many emotions by the end but feel happy and carefree by the time Together Again closes the show. All the classics are performed as well as some of the best songs on The Velvet Rope. It's a theraputic rollercoaster that's entertaining from start to finish. ",5.0
" This concert makes me feel like even now artists have got to step their game up.If were gonna pay our money for your concert you've got to give us your best. Janet does just that with the Velvet Rope. The album sings like a discovery of one's self and examination of who and where you are in life (something we all must do at some point in life). The video visually gives you a very very nice retrospect and walk down the musical memory lane of Janet's top hits. Its nice that she always pleases the fans. I'm impressed with this video. After recently listening to this album I had to have the video and I was not disappointed. I felt like rediscovered an artist whom I had not really appreciated before and I'm quite impressed and happy with my discovery of how she has influenced music and the music industry ..... ",5.0

" Janet has come a long way folks and this concert proves she is/was at the top of her game. I can clearly see her influence in other artists such as Destiny's Child and Britney Spears. Janet might not be a great vocalist in fact thats her weakness but her performances make up for what she lacks. Her dancing and her ability to rarely rely on a backing track makes her a great performer.I was probably no more than 10 or 11 when this concert was shown and it was good then and great now.Janet's energy and determination can be seen and felt throughout the show. She seems more focused than ever and it shows. Aside from that her band and dancers were on point with every key and step. All of her top hits at the time are performed; 'IF' 'Control' 'Miss You Much' and 'I get lonely' they are all here.If you want to see a great LIVE concert with great sets vocals dances costumes and props then pick this one up. Its worth the money. If your a Janet fan or a fan of Pop/R&B; music then get this DVD because its a classic. ",5.0
" Before her recent decline from the last couple of years Janet was sexy but made her performance top priority before showing flesh! True she was suggestive here as well but nothing like the blantant shows that she makes now.She performs mainly from Velvet Rope but she also performs a lot of the songs that made her an ICON such as Rhythm Nation Alright Love Will Never Do Without You & Black Cat.This is an electric concert and between this and the Hawaii concert I would recommend this one the better of the two. Get this to see Janet before her decline. ",5.0

With that in mind this video is a bargain at any price. Madonna who? ",5.0
" I saw Janet in concert but did not have good seats so this DVD is a revelation for me. The sound quality is better than being at the show since you can actually hear her and the band perform over the screaming crowd.

" I can't remember the last time I read such a dire book. I howled with laughter all the way through wondering how much worse it could get - and sure enough it got worse. If the writing is bad the plot is ludicrous. A preacher comes to offer condolences the same afternoon that the heroine's husband is shot dead. Within moments they are having sex. The sex is not sensually treated or beautifully described - no all they do is stick their tongues down each other's throats. The preacher goes to tell his paralysed wife. Her bizarre response - wait for it - is to stick her tongue down his throat. No wonder he veers away. The heroine runs off to work in the heart of Liverpool in a rose garden ten miles long (I kid you not). Did I mention she is dying? But never mind she'll make a miraculous recovery. She meets another man - even though conveniently he's dying too and she's pregnant by the preacher by now (and oh joy she hears the heartbeat of the fetus at a week... truly a miracle)! The other man lives in castle and is very rich. Of course. They consumate their affair when she sticks her tongue down his throat. Not to worry she doesn't have to perform this crude tonsil-tickling for long. The preacher turns up again. Everyone in the way drops dead leaving the coast free for the 'wicked saints' of the title to romp without blame or shame into the sunset.I could have kicked myself for buying this book; but I had been fooled by reading a mention of it by a so-called reviewer of The Mermaid Chair (which is a good book.) Then I checked all the other reviews done by reviewers of Ms Haddon's book (you can click on 'other reviews' to see what I mean) and believe I have spotted a scam. The reviewers appear to have chosen the same half dozen best sellers to review -- each on the same day! - and in each review of these other genuinely good books they mention Wicked Saints in the most glowing terms. This is cynical piggy-back riding on bona fide books made worse because this is a very badly edited (and badly written) self published book. I hope few people will be fooled as I was - and as Amazon has been. Be warned! ",1.0

" The topic explored by the author is the practice of forgery in late Antiquity to substantiate a religious cult's legitimacy. As a revised version of the author's doctoral thesis and his first book it has page after page of unnecessary excerpts whose sole purpose seems to be to let the reader know that the author really has passed his language proficiency exams. These are then followed an apology trying to explain why they really were worth quoting. It is a very boring read. Besides these stylistic annoyances the entire structure of the book takes the form of a survey of various instances of pseudepigrapha... which are then dutifully stretched back to the initial lackluster thesis. There are no fantastic insights in this book. Unless you are doing a specialization in this field I would not recommend buying this book. There are many better books in the study of religion to be savored. If you must have it for a specialization I would recommend finding it at a university library... though it may have a limited availability since it is only a revamped standard doctoral thesis that is not widely applicable in many areas of study.

I was hoping to find out more about this curse the origins and why the males kill the females. Nothing not a word about the Jaguar curse. And why do the walls and ceilings change? Ideas introduced and left at that. Ms. Feehan went once again off on a tagent. Her books become less and less meaty and more and more expensive. I will NOT be buying any further books by this author.

" The physics department at my school gets the mad ramblings of this man and I usually end up with them (seeing as how no one else will read them). In a word I sum these writings as 'nonsense.' Most of his ideas aside from being mostly incoherant and physically absurd also defy the time-tested and true concepts that the average high-school physics student could debunk. Furthermore mixed in with these insane babblings are religious and political ramblings which he tries to pass off as the only possible truth.My recommendation unless you want a good laugh or evidence of the under-education of many Americans pass on this book.

Why didn't he just put out the CD using the regular recordings? He was never a big star to begin with. I wrote this review just to warn people that it isn't like most 'live' recordings. I was very dissapointed and I still don't have a decent recording of 'Steal Away'! ",1.0
" I really can't understand why all the reviewers are going crazy over this record. First off I bought it without hearing anything by them before but it had been highly recomended to people who like Tool and Mars Volta by Amazon!! They couln't have been any more wrong. So why did i personally find this so painfull?Well the whole thing in general is quite painfull. First off the musicians. The whole band sound like studio musicians. No obvious indivuality or anything new to offer. Then we get to the vocals. The closest thing I can compare them to are Alison Moyet or Anthony and the johnsons. I don't mind Anthony and the Johnsons but this guys vocals and the music just don't rock. Which is fine. It's ok not to rock! But why the hell being a Tool fan and Mars volta fan was I recomended this? It's bland it's week and the dubby bass boring guitar playing/sound... weak vocals.. Actually forget it. The whole package.

" Lewis Keel is a music teacher in the New York public school system and while my hat's off to him for devoting his life to this worthy profession I have to say that he sounds like a high school musician. Having been a high school saxophonist myself I can honestly say I recognize talent when I hear it and it isn't heard in high school bands very often.He has the technical skills to get around the instrument as he adequately demonstrates on 'Day by Day' and 'Anthropology' but he has no real touch or feeling for what he's playing. Moreover he's prone to squeaks and squawks a la the kids who play woodwinds in public school bands. Maybe I'm just tired of hearing some of the old stand-bys like 'Love for Sale' and 'Lover Come Back to Me' but if so Lewis Keel is contributing to it. His treatment of 'Quiet Nights' is about as clinical as it gets a style I would call 'Bossa Snora.'I'm sorry Lewis.

" If you can read the above lines out loud with a straight face you just might be able to take Max Brand's Donnegan seriously. The novel has several weaknesses but the one that turns it into a spectacular failure is its ludicrous framing story.Donnegan a short red-haired tramp rides the rails in search of a man named Rusty Dick (please no snickering). Having discovered that his quarry is dead Donnegan jumps off the train forces his way into a stranger's house and falls in love with the owner's daughter on the spot. The owner one Colonel Macon sends Donnegan with his daughter to the Corner a mining town hoping that the girl will win back her lover Jim Landis from the shadowy Lord Nick who has horned in on the Colonel's profitable business arrangements with Landis. Failing that Donnegan is to kill Landis.This nearly intolerable beginning then gives place to a fairly good second act; the Corner turns out to be an interesting place with interesting characters. Donnegan wins himself an ally a giant black fighting man named George Washington Green while the beautiful scheming Nelly Lebrun proves a formidable obstacle to Donnegan. Jim Landis proves to be no opponent at all but a mere human football whom the real players are fighting to possess.Donnegan's character gets more fleshed out in the second act. As in Destry Rides Again Max Brand shows a talent for portraying a hero who is severely and obviously flawed - lazy an almost pathological liar perpetually needing to prove his manhood - yet nonetheless lovable for that. Indeed Donnegan is so flawed that the story seems to be inevitably heading for a tragic denouement that might redeem the absurdity of the first act.Unfortunately there's no such luck. Almost from the minute the shadowy Lord Nick walks on the stage (his true identity should surprise no one) the story careers off into utter absurdity again. The characters' motivations none too credible to begin with now contort into self-parody. Don't feel bad if you can make no sense whatsoever out of the last few chapters; everybody including the characters themselves is just as confused as you are.Unlike many later Western authors many of whom preferred to tiptoe around the question of racism Max Brand places race relations front and center in this novel even more than in Destry Rides Again. This time we get a clearer picture of what Brand's own racial attitudes were",1.0

" Don't buy this game because you will forever wonder why you did so. This is the worst racing game I have ever played. The bonus games are crap and are all the same thing. If this was even a decent game there would be a reason to play the bonus games. But there's not. Sure you get money but with the best car in the game fully upgraded (why did I waste my time) you can't tell a difference in the race from a crap car. All the upgrades do is take your money and waste your time.The actual racing is just as bad. Sometimes when you hit a cone you will keep right on going and even get extra in your boost gauge. Other times I have gone flying off the track because of a single cone. I don't know why and at this point I really don't care.The races beyond the very first ones are way too difficult. It is more luck than skill. In other words there is almost no way to get first and you will only get in the top 3 if the other players take themselves out. Computer cars beat the best and fully upgraded car off the line and can turn corners in about half the time without losing speed. All you can do is watch them drive away.Oh and one last thing the shortcuts suck. They are not shortcuts and usually end up taking longer because it is like threading a needle and with the handling being so bad. If you even stray a little from the exact route you will be out of bounds and have to reset. If you hit anything even going very slow you will be thrown from your car and lose time. If you do manage to do it right you might still come out behind where you were. I have only found 3 races out of 75 or whatever it is that actually have a shortcut that is worth taking. And by worth taking I mean doesn't lose you time and doesn't gain it either. Talk about a crap game. Please consider not buying this game.Bottom line",1.0

" I purchased this thermometer because we wanted an accurate thermometer and were tired of the generic drug store thermometers. We definitely need to be provided an accurate on spot temp due to my daughters health issues. I was super excited to receive this thermometer right away!!! Shipping was GREAT! I opened it read the manual and then took her temp ( knowing she was hot ) it said 98.8. I pulled out our old thermometer and it registered 100.4 THIS IS AN ISSUE! I thought maybe it was just this one time and tried it again later that evening knowing she was still running a fever. It read 99.9 old thermometer read 100.9. YET AGAIN AN ISSUE!!! I continued to try both thermometers the next day while she still had a temp and STILL had the same large variation in temps. My husband decided to call the company. No answer no answering service. He called WelchAllyn since we had no response from the Medical Supply Company. They asked if we purchased this thermometer in June? He said ummm no we just bought it 5 days ago. The associate said well this thermometer is registered as being purchased in June and we aren't sure if this Medical Supply company is a registered seller of these WelchAllyn thermometers. They are having a supervisor call us tomorrow. We called the Medical supply company yet again and finally had someone answer unfortunately they seem like they could care less about the fact that it is not working and they definitely do not care that this could have been previously owned and returned. They told us there is a 15% restocking fee for returning it unless WelchAllyn says it was previously owned. WHAT!!! So they don't know if they are selling items that are previously owned and obviously faulty? The associate at WelchAllyn said this may have been returned due to being faulty and now is being sold as 'New' through this company. THIS IS RIDICULOUS CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SALES SERVICE!!!!

" This was the first book I've read by Jamaica Kincaid and it will be my last.This book was not only BAD it was depressing. Xuela didn't loved anyone because no one loved her. She was a bitter and angry person. The line 'I did not know my mother because she died at the moment of my birth' was repeated about 100 times throughout the book.I don't know why the book was named 'Autobiography of my Mother' because she never knew her mother and constantly throughout the book said so. She hated her father because he was in a position of 'power' and took advantage of others. One other thing that bothered me about this book was her habit of touching her private parts in public and smelling her hands after. I found this hard to believe that Xuela would be so 'free' in Dominica at the time period in this book. Touching ones self is taboo among most black people whether you're born in Africa America or the West Indies.The only interesting part about this book is when her lover's wife confronted her in the street.Maybe if the book wasn't written in such a 'defeated and depressing' way it would have been better but the author's tone contridicts Xuela's 'I-don't-care-about-anyone' attitude. Xuela stated she was content or happy with herself but the tone didn't suggest that at all. ",1.0
" I really wanted to like this book based on the title and the cover art. Instead I found myself not caring about the narrator whatsoever. She repeats the same few thoughts throughout the entire book. She reminds the reader that her mother is dead and that nobody loves her so many times that I stopped caring about her situation. Her repetition and monotone voice stops the narrator from being truly developed as a character that we can connect with. Some parts of her story seem unnecessary and pointless as they don't really lead to anything of interest later on. Her characterization was too direct and left nothing for the reader to consider for themselves. The title is extremely misleading as we learn absolutely nothing about her mother- aside from her death during childbirth. I am unable to find anything positive to describe about this book sadly.

" There are plenty of tension rods out there. The _only_ advantage of the Umbra rods is that they look better. (Why other manufacturers haven't figured out the design part is anybody's guess.) The problem with the Umbra rods -- all of them -- is NO tension. I have tried these repeatedly.... Why? Because my local hardware store carries them and they are readily available elsewhere and I have opted for form over function. Every single Umbra rod I have used fails drastically. They simply cannot bear any weight. Or to put it differently they cannot exert enough force against the surfaces they extend out to for them to bear any load. Worse the springs that are the key element in sustaining the tension tend to fail. When those springs fail anything you have suspended by the rod will come down.

" Three or four years back I wrote a screenplay about a Marine who comes back from IRAQ. He is struggling to adapt to civilian life and hold onto his relationship with his wife when she is abducted in a bank robbery.As his life crumbles and the police seem less interested in recovering his wife he goes the vigilante route tracking interrogating and diving into dangerous situations ultimately leading him to Las Vegas where he uncovers a large scale plot that is bigger than he or anyone could ever imagine.Other than the fact that my script is more complex and has better dialogue the biggest difference between my script and THE MARINE is that the lead character in my script is REAL. A real flesh and blood human being Marine with vulnerabilities emotions and he actually bleeds. He's a real person like somebody you might know from your town who went to Iraq.While THE MARINE'S John Triton (John Cena) is bulletproof explosion proof dives through walls unscratched hangs onto semi-trucks while it drives through buildings and despite the bombardment of boards pipes and tin sheets he rolls off and groans before jumping up and kicking more butt. Not to mention I don't think a scene goes by that he doesn't remind everybody that he's a Marine and it's the only thing he knows. By the way the tin sheets would have severed him easily.Oh and of course the name Triton is appropriate to refer to John Cena as a Greek God or the largest moon of Neptune.Ridiculous is an understatement. This movie insults our intelligence with a symplistic unrealistic poorly written story. Deplorable acting from all involved. Was this movie trying to be a comedy? The jewl thieves are idiots and are more concerned with trying to be comedic than to try to come up with a plan to escape.The real shame is that my script is pretty well useless now. The creators of this movie make dozens of references to my script in the early goings and now my script is old news. Unfortunately hollywood big wigs have put their MONEY behind THE MARINE a silly poorly written poorly thought out poorly acted piece of junk.You need more than dozens of unrealistic and over-the-top explosions to grab this reviewer. Unfortunately I have a brain and I need more from my action movie than this stupid movie that has absolutely nothing in it that is memorable or meritable. ",1.0

The marine chases after these guys killing them one by one. You'd think they'd just give him back his wife. She means nothing to them. Give her back and they can go on with their criminal business. But no. They hold on to her.The marine runs/jumps in slow motion away from explosions at least 4 times in this movie.

" This film is complete and total garbage i mean its really bad. John plays a Marine who gets kicked out of the Corps after defying orders to save the lives of some Marines. I wont even get into that rats nest of crap. So he is discharged from the Marines and is trying to start working a civilian job. While on a road trip with his wife some people who robbed a jewelery store and happened to stop at the same gas station end up kidnapping his wife and begins his outrageously stupid and ill scripted pursuit. Fact is John was able to track his targets through the marsh and swamp while quite often they were on a road. The thought process that i have would be is that they could take any back road/dirt road or anything that connect to the main road they would be gone and he would be heading in the completely wrong direction. However somehow he is always able to find the bad guys. My biggest complain is that it is a movie about a Marine and he never really uses a gun he takes them and never uses them. I think the person who wrote it doesn't realize that every Marine is a rifleman and i cannot think of one who wouldn't use a gun to protect his wife. This movie is your standard WWE/WWF film that solves everything with hand to hand combat scenes. I mean come on if i would of wanted to watch a fighting movie then that is what i would've bought. However i bought a movie titled MARINE i fully expect there to be FIREFIGHTS and shooting. That is what really irritates me along with the pathetic acting is that it doesn't make sense. Marines are trained to use guns but this guy doesn't seem to use them even when his wife is in danger.I'm not really sure i can convey to you how bad this movie is.It would be a good film for people who prefer hand to hand combat and like movies with really bad acting and holes in the plot so big you can drive a semi truck threw them.This movie starts out bad and just gets worse and worse.Horrible Movie 1/5 stars.

" I gave this movie a chance because Robert Patrick was in it. He couldn't give it any justice at all. The action was over the top and unrealistic. The criminals were all cliched especially the African-American criminal. (Don't know why they always have to make African-American characters have a smart mouth it's too stereotypical) John Cena can't act his way out of a paper bag and he's too damn bulky with his cucumber fingers. The car chase scene with all them bullets hitting the car and Cena is still driving and able to avoid every single bullet. He's hit with multiple objects but still no mark on him. The wife gets knocked the hell out so many times but no bruise on her at all. This movie was ridiculous don't waste your time unless you're a Cena mark. ",1.0
" Now The Marine doesn't try to be a good movie it lets you know right from the beginning what it is going to be. A huge muscleman marine is told to wait for the rest of the soldiers on a mission. He says 'not enough time' and charges in to blow things up. Next scene he is being discharged and has to go find a job as a security guard. This is all in the first 2 minutes of the movie. The thing that really bothered me about the movie was that everything that went on really had no point and did not make a difference later in the film. That isn't the only thing they weren't able to complete not by a long shot. The bad guys have this big black guy on their side and he is not unfunny they just don't give him anything funny to say. I seriously think that he didn't complete a single joke. In fact the liquid metal guy from Terminator 2 stars as the main bad guy and they even throw in a reference to that and it was the only joke they actually completed. I thought that it was the least bad part of the movie.Now the reason I went to see this was becasue I was told it had great fights. The shootouts were nice to look at and the explosions became so repetitious I almost fell asleep but the fights were once again just the same old I hit you and then you hit me style. The best fight of the movie included 2 characters who were never explained and this scene could have been from entirely different film for all I know.

" You really have to give it up to wrestling promoter Vince McMahon. He has failed miserably with the WBF XFL and programs on MTV & he couldn't sell a quality meal in New York City. So Vince now tries that magic business touch in the film industry. Huh?It appears that Vince has just a little jealousy towards 'The Rock' Dwayne Johnson and his great success making movies to the point where he doesn't need to do any bumps for the WWE and the McMahon family. Granted Vince receives a nice sum of cash for Johnson's wrestling moniker to be used for movies but that just isn't enough.And where Johnson has long-since passed up the 1980s-styled superhero genre here comes Vince lumbering along in his powerwalk with his answer to The Rock John Cena. Yes that John Cena who was going to be a hip-hop star; until he proved that he has no hip and zero hop in his mic skills.But have a script comparable with Sylvester Stallone's ridiculous Rambo character - with Cena's mannerisms that could be termed as the nephew to the fictional tough-guy - blow all kinds of things up and Vince is in business. Hardly.The first weekend in theaters October 13-15 2006 The Marine did a tepid $7 million in box office sales and then sank faster than a pay-per-view main event featuring Fit Finlay.Cena plays his WWE role well but he isn't a real actor. Vince is a wrestling promoter who has failed each time he has stepped outside the family business. The Marine was produced 20-plus years too late to have anyone but the biggest WWE Cena fans taking time to see it in theaters.And Vince better keep that cozy economic reality in mind for the next flick.

Im not going to go into every stupid part of this movie but ill just say its EXTREMELY unrealistic. its so bad i think a 5 year old can point out the ridiculous things john cena 'can' do. for example hes able to practically fly and jump onto a moving truck from standing on the ground. he is also able to survive being inside a building that blows up and looks as though the atom bomb was dropped on it yet somehow he still is alive. also i might be crazy but im pretty sure if you were holding onto a truck and being rammed through a building at fast speeds you wouldnt live. also not many people i know can run through walls and not be hurt. speaking of not being hurt there is an instance in the movie while inside a burning building john cena is hit by falling burning wood and is unaffected. this movie is awful and i would recommend if your looking for an action movie to look somewhere else. i cant believe people actually buy this movie and can watch it without wanting to cry.

" I enjoy Asmov's science books. They are informative clever and witty. But his science fiction is another matter. They are poorly written. And worse I didn't believe a word of Foundation. Such accutate prediction is impossible. It's not only extremely difficult to predict the major trends but to have his character predict such minor details as well is absurd. Just one example of the difficulties of prediction",1.0
" So many people like this book and have called it a 'classic' - I felt I had to read it. I am not a hard-core sci-fi reader but I did enjoy reading books by Herbert Heinlein Bradbury and the like. So I though I'd give Asimov a chance. To my surprise I didn't like this book at all.I have read some bad books in my life but this is the first bad book I bothered to read all the way through. I kept waiting for it to get better. I kept waiting for the 'eureka' moment when I finally understood why everyone likes this book so much. It never happened and when I finally came to the end of the book I realized that Mr. Azimov stole a good two hours of my life and gave me NOTHING in return.The story sounds interesting and in the hands of another writer it may have bore fruit. Unfortunately in Mr Asimoz's hands the story falls flat in the implementation. Had the writing not been funny I would have been completely bored. Of course Mr. Azimov did not intentionally make me laugh - sadly his understanding of the human condition appears to be based largely on old cheap pulp fiction novels. The characters are completely one dimensional and unconvincing. I truly cannot understand why anyone would like this book - but calling it a classic is simply unbearable. I can only assume that most of the people reviewing this book favorably are children. In any case they are certainly not familiar with truly good writing. My advice",1.0
" Being a sci-fi fan myself I decided I wanted to try reading some of the works by the giants of sci-fi. I had always heard how great 'Foundation' was so I thought I'd start with this one. I was thoroughly disappointed! Asimov used way too many large words ('using dollar words where dime words would suffice'). The story seemed to jump around from one time to another. The characters were very one-dimensional and very flat...I didn't have that 'I wonder what's going to happen next to ---'. I just didn't care what was going to happen next to the characters or in the story. There didn't seem to be anything to propel this story along; nothing to develop the characters or the story. I read over 100 pages and I still had no interest in what was happening. (Even Stephen King who can be pretty tough to get into his stories has me hooked within 50 to 60 pages!) I just don't get what all the hype is over this book. Could someone out there PLEASE tell me! I will try to get into his Robot series...maybe he has better character and story development in them...I hope! ",1.0
" The Foundation is completely undeserving of the fame accredited to it. Had it been more eloquently executed the collage of textbook style narrative and bad dialogue might have been sufficient to generate a bearable story. All the social concepts Asmov brings up are well worn and ill-portrayed on the backdrop of a generic illogical sci-fi universe. His writing style is bland and every one of his characters can be found by an other name in star wars. ",1.0
" After somehow assiduously avoiding Asimov's seminal 'masterpiece' for over 50 years since I began reading sci-fi I decided to dip into this ponderous tome.Oh forsooth the ancient bard's Shakespearean language came alive once more only this time more than 12000 years into the future.But lo some things have never changed",1.0
" I just finished reading Foundation and was extremely disappointed. Maybe I was expecting too much something grander along the line of the Dune series. But the book in of itself is an extreme disappointment. I realize Asimov was young (21) when he wrote this but his style leaves a lot to be desired. I'll take an early Arthur C. Clarke book over Asimov any day. This is the first book by Asimov I've read and I'm not sure I want to read another. His style is very dialogue driven with very few if any detail given to what the characters think. Everyone is very two-dimensional. And he never describes any of the scenes were all of this dialog takes place. Part of the interest in science-fiction is exploring new places seeing different things. This entire story could have taken place on an empty stage. In fact it seems like it's written more for a play than a novel. As for the story it starts out interestingly enough. The Empire is going to crumble and to avoid thousands of years of dark-ages a Foundation is set up to preserve the past learning's of the Empire. Well that's what the original thought was at least. Soon we discover there's an alternate motive to this. Once we learn of this motive the story goes straight downhill. Asimov skips decades from one page to another. Characters are introduced that we know practically nothing about and he never tells us anything about them. I've read history books that had more character development than he gives the people in this book. By the time I got to the end I found myself saying 'So what'? Am I supposed to continue on reading this series because it's been called a 'classic'. I've seen the word 'classic' thrown around a little too much sometimes. This is definitely one of those times.

" Recently finding myself with a lot of time on my hands after having just graduated school I started picking up and reading a lot of the 'greatest' works of science fiction. After having noticed all the editorials reviews and awards attributed to the Foundation series I didn't hesitate to order all the books in the series. What a mistake! I'm not sure what people are seeing in these novels but in no way do they even come close to approaching some of the other hallmarks of sci-fi like Dune Ender's Game you name it. This book has a semi-interesting setup about trying to preserve civilization during a coming galactic dark age but beyond that the book devolves into stupid scenario after scenario about how the Foundation is threatened but through the citizens' skill (i.e. sheer stupidity and dumb luck) they manage to somehow make it through the crisis only to face another yawner a few pages later. In between each crisis numerous years elapse so by the time Asimov sets up the next unrelated crises the entire cast of characters changes -- you barely have time to figure out their names much less get to know any person in significant detail.This series of books did nothing but put me to sleep on multiple occassions when normally if a book is good I'll stay up all night to finish it. My advice is to steer well clear from this series and try one of the other highly rated sci-fi books out there -- there are so many others that would be far preferable. ",1.0
" I only recently read this so called masterpiece. I even went do far as to order the special complete edition from the Science Fiction Book Club. Even though I got through it I cannot believe all of the outstanding reviews and awards this series has received. No characters no science no mystery (who couln't figure out the identitiy of the Mule?). In addition the story is basically one of the collapse of the Roman Empire. It probably could have been rewritten replacing historical language instead of spacefare and it would not have mattered in the slightest. The only science fictional element was Psychohistory which is not developed at all due to the nature of the plot. If this is a classic I shall stick to more obscure and worthwhile reads. Blech. ",1.0

" I have not read James Marcus' book 'Amazonia' but in a recent NPR interview he insisted that during his Amazon tenure he was never pressured to write positive reviews of things he found crappy. However Amazon's editorial review above makes me doubt such a claim. If the guy had said this movie is so bad that it's good I could accept that. But to suggest that 'Mean Guns' has redeeming qualities that anyone involved with it actually intended it to have? You've got to be kidding.Also do not believe the overall user rating for this movie or the low ratio of helpful to unhelpful votes that my review will inevitably get (assuming anyone ever actually reads it). Most people who have rated it are probably Christopher Lambert fans so they obviously have no taste. For anyone who realizes Lambert has less acting talent than a dead dog let me inform you that 'Mean Guns' is actually terrible. I will admit that I found it to be enjoyably bad -- the incompetence of everyone involved gave me a few pretty good laughs. But enjoyably bad is still bad. I will say this -- at least it was not nearly as horrible as the previous Pyun-Lambert project 'Adrenalin",1.0
" MEAN GUNS is a vile pointless movie with no redeeming qualities. The horrible acting of Ice T has never been so flagrantly evidenced as in this loser. He plays some kind of syndicate lord who assembles all these people who have somehow betrayed the syndicate (this includes for no apparent reason a vampire?). Armed with not only guns but baseball bats the movie is one long let's see how many people we can kill in ninety minutes. The murders are offensively brutal and with a plot that limps along one has to wonder why this movie was even made. How can we root for anyone when they are all heartless cold-blooded killers? Christopher Lambert the stone faced hero of B movies even brings along his little daughter to wait in the car while the murders go on. The movie tries to embrace some kind of code of honor among murderers but is there honor among these low lifes? One female actress who plays Barbie is so obnoxious I couldn't wait for her to meet her demise and it takes a long time to happen too. With an ending that is so forced and implausible MEAN GUNS is one mean film and that doesn't mean you should watch it if you know what I Mean. ",1.0

The couple who are later attacked by the biker gang are having sex in a field - one of the good guys appears watching them from a distance and shouts over to them. This scene appeared before the first chase scene and is missing from this version.The transfer appears to be a transplant from a poor quality laserdisc version and the sound is in mono.What appalled me was the American dubbing - this seems typically arrogant and ignorant to me. In any other country in the world you would not find this and its unfair and condescending to the portion of Americans who wanted to see the 'unbutchered' Australian version.

Half of the movie is on a ship in the water. You think he'd miss the chance for some rays?4. Does he have sex with a C-List actress? JCVD goes for a little anonymous redhead in this one.5. Is there a tournament? Perhaps if a race is sport and all tournaments are sport maybe it's a tournament. Otherwise it's just the Americans versus the Russians6. Is training needed for this tournament? Only acting training7. Does he do the splits in training or in the tournament? This may be the only movie in which a character not only does the splits while wearing a suit and a tie but he also does it in khakis.8. Does he punch someone in the balls? To be honest I can't say I remember it happening. However given the fact that I dozed off during several scenes it's entirely possibly that JCVD performed a fistectomy.9. Does he do a series of flying or 360 kicks? In every single fight.10. Is his enemy unbeatable? Hardly. He's just a little Asian guy with big hair and a black belt.11. Does he overcome an injury or other hindrance? Aside from being a Belgian acting as a Russian and speaking in broken English...not really.12. Does he win? It doesn't matter - the viewer loses.Some planes go down over the Mediterranean and three were carrying top secret laser guidance systems. The rest is a race to get them before the Russians. Somehow a Japanese guy codenamed 'Black Eagle' goes in for the United States and a Belgian guy goes in for the Russians. And that's probably the movie's biggest problem; it's nearly incomprehensible the majority of the time because of various language barriers that aren't overcome.A fan of JCVD action or good movies will be severely disappointed. He's barely in the movie and the rest is just bad. When you begin to crave the acting talents of JCVD then you know the rest of the movie is slop. This is definitely a blemish on his career; I'm just not sure if it's wart or a zit. ",1.0

I am saddened and more than a bit annoyed (I purchased the book on the basis of the organization's recommendation) that the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry would put its imprimatur on a book containing such little insight.

" I bought this backpack when I wanted to have a new bag for my laptop. I got a good JanSport Backpack for my niece a few month ago and she liked that one so I chose JanSport again. It's out of question that JanSport is generally a good brand.But this particular backpack is really poorly made. The texture is made by some cheap materials and definitely looks not as good as the picture shown on the website. There are not many compartments in the bag with poor paddings and the space is not as big as that was described at all. Nevertheless the laptop sleeve is too wide for my 15' widescreen notebook. So I bought another backpack of Swissgear this weekend when I saw it on sale with only one third price of this JanSport. And the quality of my new bag is Much Much Much BETTER than this one.Don't buy this backpack! ",1.0
" I had a Jansport pack which I dragged all over the world for 12 years. It finally needed some serious repairs and I sent it in. Apparently they no longer repaired that model and sent me a Firewire instead.First the pack is made for midgets. It is simply not long enough for my back. I'm 6' and don't have unusual proportions so this is kind of disturbing.Second the weird laptop pocket in the main compartment is an incredible design flaw. The rigid support at the bottom is about two inches above the bottom of the backpack so if you load the pack whatever you put in can't ride against your lower back and effectively pulls the backpack into a curve so you feel the very straight rather uncomfortable stays at the bottom of the laptop pocket and the top of the shoulder straps.It's simply not an acceptable pack for day to day use as it's designed.

When you're done your exam you can look at which questions you got right and wrong but be careful because once you quit the cd all that info is lost and you'll never get to see your precious exam marks again!

" As a molecular biologist & a HUGE red sox fan I was very excited to see how Polidoro handled the controversy associated with his subject. Well he didn't... in the story as he presented it there was no controversy with the exception of a few animal rights activists. Are you kidding me?!? The entire story was unbelievable baseless naive and repetitive. On top of that it was also incredibly poorly written. Which brings me to the question I ask in my review title. Did anyone edit this book? The dialog was cringe-worthy the story flowed horribly and there were numerous grammatical errors. Not to mention the huge errors in timeline continuity! My favorite involved a character telling her husband that she's just found out that she's pregnant and attributes it to a sex act that took place over 8 months earlier in the story. How does an editor not catch that? All in all it's typical of a book by someone who has what could be a very interesting topic but thinks that all you need to do to write a good book is put together a happy ending story and randomly plop in a bunch of lame pop culture historical and geographical references (what do the swans in the public garden have to do with anything??) While clearly based on other reviews presented here there are people who enjoyed this book I myself can't think of any audience for whom this novel would be appropriate. It was painful. ",1.0

" This book is so boring that doctors should recommend it to those with insomnia because it'll put you right to sleep. Billed as an erotic book of essays it did not succeed with its task.The author seems to dwell in his promiscuity but bores us with stories about his furniture and odd stains on his upholstery instead of telling us how those stains got there.In another essay he tells of his dying lover in the hospital and the last time they performed together then at the funeral his lover's nurse comes to tell him that he was 'with' the lover several times--and the author thought that was comforting. Yet there were no details of any of these couplings.There is a point when trying to write erotica intelligently which I am all for that the writer inadvertantly eradicates all hints of passion and heat. The author completely leaves his readers cold and unmoved and still not in the mood which is unfortunate. This book could have been very steamy and still maintained its dignity had the writer moved into the scenes and relived the physicality of his sessions. But no we are to read about distant memories that have no feeling or touch attached.Instead of this book being labeled and marketed as erotica it should have been listed as autobiographic...and if these are the highlights of a life I feel sorry for the subject--how can one lead a life so boring?

" I was neither satisfied with the product nor the 'shopping experience' for this product. I specifically wanted this to cook brown rice as we are trying to eat healthier. It tends to get scorched on the stove top plus takes a long time (not so long in hindsight). I talked to friends who had a rice cooker (not this brand) that they were happy with and then I read the reviews on Amazon and other sites. This cooker apparently was rated highly by Cook's magazine and was reasonably priced. Since most of the negative reviews seemed to be about ease of cleaning I thought it would work out. It seems to only be available online either from Amazon or Walmart (online only). The day it arrived I read the directions thoroughly (some reviewers mentioned that measurements need to be fairly precise) and followed them. The manual mentioned that white rice would be ready in about 30 minutes but did not mention how long it took for brown rice to cook though it had some suggested recipes. I just cooked basic brown rice in a small quantity. Well it took one and a half hours for it to be done and it was quite soggy. I was not willing to keep the item and 'tweak' the process to try to get decent rice so I cleaned it up and repacked it and checked on the return process. Since this item was not handled by Amazon directly I had to contact the company that sent the product with an email and wait for them to approve my reason for returning it and give me a return authorization code to include with my packaging. They did approve the return and I sent it back via UPS. It cost me over 17 dollars for the return shipping (not anthing expedited just regular UPS that was supposed to take about 10 days for it to reach the destination). I tracked the package until it reached the seller and then waited for my refund. When a month had passed and still no refund I called them to let them know. They did respond quickly after my call for me to get a refund. However I will never purchase an item like this from Amazon again especially if it's through another seller.

It is very sad that the Princeton publishers did not even bother to proofread the book and if they ever even bother it is most likely for grammatical purposes rather than for the Chemistry content. I have written to the Princeton publishers reagarding this issue and all they can say is they are very sorry that I am disappointed.

However it does keep you on your toes and constantly running to your text books to double check facts. I'm not sure if that is a good thing though... Come test time it wouldn't be hard to become confused between what is right and what you saw in the book.

" This book based on limited family input collected circa 1856 then written after all of John Mercier McMullen's siblings were deceased in 1902 has been proven by his genetic male descendants based on DNA testing and extensive genealogical research to have been a political fabrication. It was not published in 1902 or following his death in 1908 by any surviving male relations of John M McMullen including his own sons. Rather it was a maternal grandaughter who published it in 1960. His motivation in modifying fabricating or in several cases actually eliminating truthful information appears to have been a desire for acceptance by the British aristocracy of the day in his Upper Canadian village of Brockville. This resulted in an effort by John McMullen to position his historical family as pro-UBE anti Irish and of lowland Scot extraction. The facts suggest exactly the opposite with oral history as provided by sibling descendants genetic DNA test results and actual interviews with Irish families in the village of Kells Co. Kilkenny (where John came from not the north of Ireland) who knew this family as late as 1950. An example of fabrication would be his statement that James McMullen was one of the 13 apprentices of Derry exposed as a falsehood in correspondence with the association itself.

" Tom Lehrer once said that political satire died the day Henry Kissinger was given the Nobel Peace Prize. Thus it is with cinematic satire as this film won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. There is no story of any worth here. It adds nothing to our understanding of the human condition (which other reviewers seem to imply is where its value lies) per se it is merely a series of sketches in search of a coherent theme which fails qua entertainment. McKellan and Redgrave do their best but with such prosaic material to work off they cannot save a very boring film whose raison d'etre escapes the ever increasing somnolent viewer. That it won an Oscar for the screenplay says far more about the Academy's often appalling decisions than anything else. Perhaps like the American Presidency lobby money can buy anything. ",1.0

" James Whale is an old deceprit man. He has lived a life of fame thanks to his direction of the first two Frankenstein movies. When Whale begins trying to sketch his new gardener Clay Boone memories of his past begin to flood his mind. Boone eventually finds out that Whale is homosexual. While this makes him uneasy he returns over and over again. The film follows their strange relationship.One of the problems I have with this movie is the fact that it focuses entirely on Whale's sexual preference. Are viewers not supposed to care about anything else besides his homosexuality? Because I do.Also the relationship between Boone and Whale is a perpetually bizarre one. Despite how uncomfortable he sometimes becomes when in Whale's presence Boone cannot keep himself away. I found it quite unbelievable.Lastly this movie is incredibly monotonous. Nothing really interesting occurs until the last thirty minutes.Near the end James asks Clay 'Do you believe people come into our lives for a purpose?' Well I believe that all films should have a purpose whether that be to make people laugh cry or ponder. This one simply doesn't. ",1.0

" Sharing my experience with a recent purchase of velodyne vx-11Why i say poor product quality?1. Unit not working and faulty which means no quality assessment and checks2. Volume control knob connected in the ICs are not working which means potential sub standard material. Is this a common issue in china made products and patented in the US?3. Amp was found faulty yet this is a new product.Another example of poor QC check and poor components.Why I say bad service reputation?1. I was upfront when I placed the order that the product will be used in Singapore and even requested for 220 voltage product. My request was declined due to policy though they sell 220 voltage to the local dealer in sg.2. I placed the order and mentioned that I will use a step down power converter to make it work. I was not informed that the unit is not able to support power converter only later on when I reported that the product is not working.3. When I received the unit and found that it is not working I felt they are not committed to help and was told that the warranty has been voided because the product was used outside US. I was informed that the unit is not able to support converter. They even mentioned shipping as possible cause of damage. Any service check will be my cost.4. Went to see a known service center and found that the problem is not due to the converter. Infact the internal components when the service staff open the sub has a 110 and 230 volts selection.

" Two weeks ago I purchased this Black and Decker product from my local CVS store in California. Brand-new out of the package it wouldn't work. I felt reassured that at least it had a two year warranty and was a 'name brand' of Black and Decker. I was shocked when I phoned the Black and Decker service center in Texas the 800-544-6986 that was included with the warranty info ...and they told me that since the item had been manufactured three years earlier (there was a 2007 date-sticker on product) and since this product had been discontinued by Black and Decker they could not honor the warranty for repair or replacement.I informed the Black and Decker service-center manager [Anita] that it was not legal for Black and Decker to claim 'no responsibility' for their warranty and they couldn't refuse to honor their warranty just because they discontinued the item (particularly because I had just purchased it two weeks prior & had my receipt). She then gave me a local Black and Decker service-center phone number in California where the representative ('Dave') informed me that because the item was discontinued by Black and Decker 'I was out of luck' and there was nothing they could do. It was just suggested I return the item to the store.Beware consumers! Black and Decker is setting new precedents in skirting their legal responsibilities regarding honoring their product-warranties. It seems that since the volume of complaints are so high regarding Black and Decker products not much attention is being paid to this negligence on Black and Decker's part (and who has the time and money to bring a 'breach of warranty' case to court for a $50. item?)After this experience I will never again have confidence in the Black and Decker name and I urge you to consider researching consumer-complaints about this company's customer-service before purchasing Black and Decker products.Tom in Encinitas California ",1.0

Keep in mind that this story occurred in 1820. I hardly think that the use of the politically correct term African American was even conceived at that time. The author also seems to want to build the case that because the black members of the crew were the first to die that there may have been racial reasons for this to occur. He discusses the difference in body fat content between blacks and whites and the closeness of the Nantucket Quakers which may have accounted for the whites being treated differently while trying to survive at sea.

In my case only TIVO N USB Network adapter can be detected by the TIVO premiere.The horror story began like this. My TIVO Series2 often failed to download programs via the slow phone modem. 12/4/2010 I called TIVO service . They told me to buy the TIVO premiere but they did not tell me that I needed an adapter. During the call I bought the Premiere only. After the call and studying the web info I decided to buy this G adapter from Amazon. It was easy to connect but could not be detected by TIVOs. I called TIVO service and they told me to buy another G adapter from Best Buy since I might have gotten a bad G adapter from Amazon. Again it was not detected. I had to return the second one to Best Buy. More time and energy wasted and plus frustration. All of the above took 3 weeks to find out. I don't understand why they insisted that I should get another G adapter. Also I found that bad history repeating here see [...]Finally 1/6/2011 TIVO people sent me the N adapter.

The wireless router and modem are barely 30 feet from the TiVo box with open space throughout. My laptop easily achieves 12Mbps without a hitch.For a goof we moved the wireless router and modem to the kitchen table and hooked it up to the laptop. Only then were we able to get a decent signal with the wireless router about 8 feet from the TiVo box and network adapter. Several calls to TiVo got me canned simple fixes to try. It works best when you throw it in the trash. ",1.0
" We received our Baby Born doll today and quickly got our son to distract our daughter so that we could get a quick peak at her Christmas present. At first we thought the doll was adorable. However after our daughter went to bed we got it out of the packaging before wrapping it (it is one of our pet peeves to spend Christmas morning wrestling with wires and cardboard) and attempted to discover all of its 'functions.' Supposedly it 'squeals with delight.' I kept looking for some way to make this baby do something -- anything -- and then my husband took it and forcefully squeezed its left arm and finally a pitiful squeak came out. It is not a 'squeal of delight' but more like a dog toy squeak. Not only that but no 38 pound girl could muscle up the strength to make this doll squeak. It came with two tubes and no directions as to where to put these tubes. I have edited anatomy textbooks so I'm not dumb as far as where the possible orifices might be! There was just no logical explanation for these strange tubes that we could find even after reading every single piece of paperwork. So tossing the tubes aside we tried to give her water. It leaked out of her neck (no surprise what with the missing tubes). We packaged the entire sham back up and really really hope that they give us our money back -- minus the shipping charge. What a scam. We are hoping for better luck with Corelle. I'm just happy we didn't keep it in the packaging only to have our daughter be the disappointed one on Christmas morning while she discovered its 'functions.' ",1.0

When you give the doll water it instantly starts peeing better when it is laying down than when it sits on the potty. No matter how you turn it and how you close or open the valve IT LEAKS. I could not see any tears no matter how I turned it. Overall big waste of money I would STRONGLY RECOMMEND AGAINST IT.

" Factually shaky at many points pedestrian prose self-aggrandizing and a page turner only for wanting to finish the awful thing. What I found most offensive about this book was the author's egotistical disdain for the 'lesser climbers' of the team. In fact she and her fellow leaders showed nothing but hostility to many members and they all come off as smug arrogant jerks. Having been on climbing expeditions before there is a great deal of stress raw feelings etc but the raw and condescending behavior of the author and trip leaders is disgusting. Don't even get started on their ugly American 'analysis' of Asians on Denali.Read this book if you one day want to write a mountaineering book and this one will point to every flaw in doing so. ",1.0
" I give this book one star because it made nice lining for my bird cage. Others have described more eloquently than I can why this is not a good book to read. I found the author mean pompous and racist. As a climber of many years I can honestly say I would never tie into a rope with her. ",1.0
" Ruth Anne Kocour the greatest female climber of all time documents her extreme valor in saving all souls on the mountain. Climbers live by a certain code we help each other. Ms. Kocour apparently believes she is above and beyond helping the sick and dying climbers. She believes that 'the best thing mountaineers can do for others is to take care of themselves'. When sitting in camp not even a particularly high camp at that climbers help one another. The summit is the goal but it is not what is most important. Ms. Koncour could not find the time to help out a climber who was in need of medical attention because she was busy clearing snow from her tent something she did every few hours. she could not help this wretched soul? Remember she is only at 13000 feet. While this may sound high it really is not. Conditions in a storm of the magnitude experienced that half week on denali are not fun but the situation is not like K@ or Everest where medical help and resupply may be an impossobility depending on ones altitude. THe height that Ms Koncour refers too is still well within range of airplane and helicopter support. What we learn from this book and Ms. Koncour is that if ever we are on a climbing team with her find another team you wont regret it. Based on rep alone i would not climb with her. ",1.0
" This book would be a joke if it were not dangerous. There's nothing wrong with being guided on a mountain...in fact it may be a comparatively safe way to enjoy an outdoor experience (and it keeps many climbers employed. There's also nothing wrong with writing about the experience of being guided...David Roberts Jon Krakauer and others have done that entertainingly and tastefully. But to title it 'the extreme...true courage...death-defying survival...a quest' shows serious signs of self-delusion. I am most concerned that some innocent will pick this book up enjoy it and do something really stupid.Hint",1.0
" I received a copy of this book as a gift and out of courtesy I read it despite misgivings spawned by the liner notes. In a poorly writen poorly edited poorly researched tribute to herself the author tries to describe the horrific ordeal she and her team mates (mostly her teammates on whom she was merciless in her criticisms) endured on Denali. They were 'trapped' at the 14200' camp on Denali in a severe storm that claimed 11 lives in May of 1992. The 14200' camp is as large as any k-Mart parking lot and just as flat. The idea of 'clinging' to the mountain from this camp is ridciulous. The camp had a ranger hut staffed by park service rangers and volunteers as well as a medical station. I am sure that their stay there was uncomfortablebut far from life threatening. The author attempts to exaggerate her own situation at the expense of those who were truly in danger on the mountain and those who died there. Her attraction to a body bag containing the remains of a man who died at the 14200' camp (of natural causes) was ghoulish and nauseating. She put me in mind of the rear echelon soldier who presents second hand stories of the horrors of war as his own. The author claims that on 'the mountain' the other climbers called her 'The Woman'. I would venture to guess that her team mates called her a lot of other things as well. In summary the Author attempted to portray a professionally guided climb on the easiest busiest route on Mt. McKinley as something much more than it was and did so at the expense of others. *Note to the editor* Orizabo is not the second highest peak in North America. Mt. Logan is much higher and far more difficult. Talkeetna is about 70 miles from Denali not 250 as stated over and over in the book ",1.0
" One unfortunate outgrowth of the success of excellent climber/writers such as Jon Krakauer Greg Child and Bill Sherwonit is the publication of books such as Facing the Extreme which seek to capitalize on the sudden interest in human suffering in the mountains. Facing the Extreme by Ruth Anne Kocour and Michael Hodgson is filled with many seemingly small factual errors which in the end add up and made me question Ms. Kocour's journalistic credibility (though she is not a journalist by trade it is still her responsiblity as an author to get it right). Though not a factual error in the Author's Note Ms. Kocour tells us that she has changed the names of her fellow climbers (with the exception of the guides) as she cannot '...speak for them or tell their story'. What she dosen't come right out and tell you is that her portrayal of her fellow climbers is focused almost entirely on both their personal and mountaineering shortfalls. If we are to believe Ms. Kocour she was the toughest mentally and physically the most skilled and the person with the fewest personality shortcomings. After elevating herself she clearly had no choice but to change the names of her fellow climbers. My biggest problem with Facing the Extreme comes with the obvious lack of fact checking. Ms. Kocour states that Talkeetna is 70 miles from Anchorage when it is approximately 114 miles. She also tells us that Denali is 250 miles from Talkeetna and the single engine Cessna made the flight to Denali Base Camp in 40 minutes an obvious impossiblity. Denali is actually only 60 miles by road from Talkeetna. In addition there are serious climbing factual errors as well all the more shocking considering Ms. Kocour's oft repeated (in the text anyway) expertise. Ms. Kocour claims that while camped at high camp at 17200 feet the climbers had now entered the 'death zone'. Actually the 'death zone' as it is known to climbers begins at approximately 26000 feet nearly 9000 feet higher than high camp on Denali. In fact Base Camp on Mount Everest where climbers spend close to 2 months at a time is at approximately 17700 feet some 500 feet higher that high camp on Denali. Ms. Kocour also states that she '...had been to 23000 feet on Aconcagua' difficult to do since Aconcagua is 22841 feet high a seemingly small error but an important distiction to climbers. If you want to spend money reading books by female climbers/explorers I suggest The Climb of my Life by Laura Evans or Artic Daughter by Jean Aspen. ",1.0
" I really wanted to like this book. Most climbing accounts are written by superstars of the sport. Ms. Kocour's book held promise of an honest account of an amateur 'weekend warrior'. The struggle of a group of amateur climbers thrown together to climb Denali has all the elements of a superb human drama. Unfortunately the depiction of the human spirit is perhaps the Mt. Everest of writing and Ms. Kocour is not an Everest climber - in either the mountaineering or the literary sense. Her character development is one-dimensional at best. The guides are all-wise guardian angels whose cosmic connection to the mountain is boringly infallible. Her fellow clients are either hapless bumblers or selfish dolts who would run off in panic were it not for the heroic presence of the author. Ms. Kocour's dialogue is downright silly. She apparently equates crudity with authenticity which perhaps accounts for her preoccupation with the many ways to defecate and urinate on the mountain. Upon her deliverance off the mountain she gushes to her guide 'You did a great job of leading - a tribute to your family's storied mountaineering and guiding history'. Do you think she really said that? Do you talk that way? Ms. Kocour compounds the problem by trying to portray her trip (and her role in it) as an astonishing mountaineering feat which it was not. Sure there was a bad storm but while Ms. Kocour was spending several chapters admiring her own ability to sit in the tent waiting for her guides to cook her dinner Park Service rangers and mountain rescue personnel were out in the teeth of the storm working to help climbers. Their presence is barely acknowledged. Climbing Denali on a guided trip is a tremendous physical and mental challenge and Ms. Kocour is right to be proud of it. However her trip should not be confused with a right of passage to 'serious' mountaineering. Any reasonably fit individual with three weeks and a few thousand dollars can sign on with any one of several excellent guide services to be led up the West Buttress of Denali. Hundreds of people do it every year. Ms. Kocour's very accomplished guides told the clients when to get up what to carry what direction to go and where to camp. The customers including Ms. Kocour followed their guide every day tied in line to a rope. To assert as Kocour does that being led up the West Buttress of Denali along with two or three hundred other people qualifies her to climb Everest is the sort of hubris that has contributed to so many deaths on that mountain. All in all this is just a bad book. It could have been the story of an individual's triumph over her own limits. Instead it was a tiresome tribute by the author to herself. Were it not for the mass market success of Jon Krakauer's Everest account this book would have been rightly relegated to the bargain bin. I won't even start on the editing ",1.0

" I hate when historical dramatizations treat facts in so frivolously fictitious a fashion that one ends up wondering why the thing was ever made. Why invent when any given reality is ever so more precious?I don't know all that much about Brummell (and learned very little about him in this flick) but I do about Byron. To perfidiously suggest that Lord Byron played a large part in bringing Brummell down is what is truly scandalous in this silly telling. Scrope Davis Byron's life-long friend was a crony of Brummell's - but Byron's interplay with Brummell is marginal if even that. Yet even beyond the slanderous suggestions of Byron's dissolute and desultory effects on this biopic's supposedly charming hero there is the matter of Matthew Rhys attempting to step into Byron's boots one of which was fashioned for a lame leg. Simply put if the historical Lord Byron was anything at all like the one portrayed in this film no women would have swooned and fainted when he entered a room (and if they had it would have been out of fright!) nor would they have scrambled across continents to 'unphilosophize' him. Unlike the actual Byron who was according to one of his innumerable lovers famously judged 'mad bad and dangerous to know' - Rhys is well just 'bad.' And NOT in a 'good' way! It hardly helps matters that he looks more like a cross twixt the young Steven Spielberg and the young Barbra Streisand than one of the most beautiful faces of the day.But apart from Byron if one knew hardly anything whatsoever about Beau Brummel about a quarter way in one might be wondering why in the world they were watching this film. It is minimal to an excessive degree. And apart from the Spartan script there is a truly threadbare feel to this entire undertaking. The whole story is alloted a few cramped sets - and no sense of the true style of the era is conveyed. I also understand that the modernistic music score is supposed to hint at Brummell's futuristic sense of style and all ('the dashing designer of modern dress - and disgrace') it says on the DVD cover - yet the music isn't great - it merely grates. And even though people came from far and wide to watch our fashion-plate hero dress I highly doubt if he permitted them to watch him attire himself from a ballsy state of complete nudity.In short I wasted money on this one money I could have placed on a number at the nearest gaming table.

I wanted to know how people reacted to his darker colors and simpler masculine less-effeminate style. How long did it take to change men's fashion? Brummell made a courageous statement in fashion and yet there was no grandiose cinematic show of it. There was one scene where gentlemen came to watch him dress but there was little explanation as to why they would waste their time. Wigs and perfume were all used to mask the lack of bathing and yet there was no significant statement of the change Brummell enacted. How did he convince men to bathe more often and how did he influence the importance of personal hygiene for both men and women? There was more to be told of the story and the movie failed. ",1.0

It was very disappointing. Any one interested in Rimbaud would do much better reading - Rimbaud- by Enid Starkie or -Rimbaud- by Pierre Petitfils. Both are excellent. ",1.0

" With all due respect for the authors I have to say that these stories (Stories! Not novels) seem to be written by 5th grade students. Yes the spelling was corrected when the books were published but the description dialogue and overral quality offered is very poor. I've read some parts of every book and it's really hard to understand what is going on. It seems as if the writers were really inspired and concentrated on what the text means more than how the text is presented.Don't forget the fact that since the books were written by different authors there are many plot holes that make the story very hard to understand and will leave you saying 'But why...'. These books were only written to make some quick cash out of the portion of the growing Halo fan base that knew how to read and write.Conclusion",1.0
" I checked this book out from my local La Leche League. I'm surprised they still have this book available. Being nearly twenty years old maybe some of my problems are with it being outdated. However my main gripe is that it is very condescending and judgmental. Instead of just informing you on different options (none of which would work for me and only one or so that would apply well to a full time job) this book presents a certain ideal and if the job arrangements do not fit that ideal they're not good arrangements and you aren't a good mother. If you want helpful non-opinionated advice this is not the book for you. Currently I'm reading 'The Working Mother's Guide to Life' which seems much more friendly and helpful. ",1.0

" First off my opinion comes from a musicians veiw.I began listening to At the drive in when they hit the scene in the mid 90s....i was turned on by their weird time changes and aggersive vocals. When the band broke up i was upset and i felt that the void would not be filled. When i heard Omar was fronting The mars volta i knew he would stay true to experimental music and indeed i was correct.I can not say the same for Sparta how ever i find that Cedric's vocals are often flat and they sound more like an unexperienced singer. Their music falls short maybe more production could be used to beef up the songs. I find comparing the mars volta to sparta an unfair comparision. The songs in general are caught up trying to be punk when they sound more like un inpsired emo tunes.......i guess maybe they are trying to hard to please......have you seen the videos! ",1.0

" Okay....with the break up of ATDI It is pretty obvious that all the talent went to The Mars Volta. These guys don't suck. They are just boring. They sound like every other band I have heard before that is out there making music with no uniqueness really. People think just because they can play an instrument that they can get a deal and start a band. This is what Sparta did just like all the other 500 bands in the industry who all sound exactly alike. The MArs Volta has tried new things and these new things have separated them from the 500 other bands. Like Tool Led Zepplin Pink Floyd And Queen...Mars Volta tried something different which has gained them a great amount of respect. Sparta? I can name a million other bands similar. ",1.0
" Of the two bands that ATDI splintered into it should be obvious at this point which one is actually worth listening to. The Mars Volta makes intelligent frenetic insane polyrythmic guitar-prog music while Sparta have found their niche in the world of tepid whiney radio rock.There's nothing interesting about this album. There are songs that are slightly catchy but nothing well written or particularly original. Even the cover looks stupid. Waste your money elsewhere. ",1.0
" If you're looking for a true 'collection' of some funny Stooge moments it's best to buy the Sony pictures chronological series. This 'collectors' edition' contains the same old shorts and other material you've probably seen countless times.That's not to say the four included shorts aren't funny (in fact 'Brideless Groom' with Shemp as the lead character and Malice in the Palace also with Shemp are both probably in my top five favorites) it's just that this set leads one into thinking they're getting some real gems here and not just the old public domain stuff we've seen for years and that we could get cheaper at any dollar store.One version of this 'collectors' edition' from Madacy is packaged in a fancy-looking tin lunch box with a whoopie cushion inside like that's going to fool anyone into thinking you're not just getting Brideless Groom Sing a Song of Six Pants Malice in the Palace and Disorder in the Court again along with the same old unfunny animated cartoons from the 60s and live-action segments with the almost aggressively unfunny Curly Joe DeRita. Those live action segments are only worth it to see Larry and Moe and also Emil Sitka from time to time but it's best to just tune out Curly Joe. Talk about sucking the air out of a room.In summary four public domain shorts and a small batch of unwatchable animated cartoons and some obvious filler do not justify this release's claim to being a collectors' set nor does the actual product you're getting merit its fancy packaging. To claim that this is a '75th anniversary collection' is an absolute insult to the stooges.Also the Curly impersonator who intros some of the fluff material needs to shut up already. ",1.0

I thought 'Wow maybe there is hope for rap-metal.' So I went out and bought the CD expecting great things. First off like every other reviewer mentions these guys want to be the Beastie Boys so bad but believe me friends these guys can't even hold a candle to the Beastie Boys. This whole CD is dreadfully boring and now 'Stick Em Up' is starting to sound just a little to manufactured. Nothing caught my ear on this CD I was just so bored. I always try to sit through at least one full sitting of every CD I buy but this was torture! I do not recommend this CD at all. ",1.0
" Okay I knew going into this CD that it'd be heavily rap influenced after hearing Stick Em Up. I was extremely disappointed. It's basically all rap. They just get some people who are not even listed as part of the band to play an occasional riff on the guitar or provide background bass. The only thing that made this CD worth it was 'tarfur.' it's supposedly the first rap song written entirely in Icelandic. However Quarashi makes Limp Bizkit sound like Metallica Quarashi is so heavily rap. I wouldn't recommend it cuz they're not even very good MCs.

It kept me thinking for a full year afterwards. If you've had a similar experience with the book be prepared for absolute and total disappointment with the film. It will entirely pollute that part of your mind that the book developes so delicately and will leave you feeling deeply frustrated and disappointed. Worse still though if you see the film before reading the book you will be driven from the subject entirely too repulsed to give the book a chance not to mention the topic in general. The 'visitors' themselves represent a new low in film effects and appear to be at best discount inflatable puppets motivated by discarded animatronics. In total I feel an urgent sense that this film does a terrible disservice to Whitley Streiber shifting the story of his experience from a place of thoughtful contemplation into the realm of the comically yet absolutely disregardable.

And what's with the cover of Deep Purple's Space Truckin? The guitar tones are weak the drummer doesn't seem like he knows what he's doing and the song writing is just plain BAD.

" Plan 9 from Outer Spacewas an Oscar-winning performance compared to this dread of Hollywood. Actually I'm a gigantic fan of 'Plan 9' but I could find nothing whatever here to whet my usual fancy for almost all of the older black-and-white horror films.From the opening credits (which was reminiscent of some minor reprobate holding a cheesily scribed piece of poster board because it sort of 'moves around') I sensed that this one wasn't going to make my Hit Parade. Then in the very first scene the viewer is hilariously treated to a gal (who was ugly enough prior to make-up) who's wearing a pair of those paraffin buck teeth that we use to buy at the candy store back in the 50s for a nickel punctuated with the furry eyebrows of mouse-hair rivaling those of Martin Scorcese on a bad hair day.The devastating uppercut came with a performance by Page Cavanaugh and His Trio which the director clearly viewed as a big plus for his film. I'm inclined to not share his enthusiasm for that threesome of un-renowned musical geeks.I realize that this is 'troubled youth in the '50s Drive-in' fare and the movie should be viewed tongue-in-cheek... but an aardvark doesn't have enough tongue for this one.

" Alright folks. This is one of those films. Adjust the rating depending on your preference. If your looking for a GOOD Horror movie than apply the one star review. If your a masochist and/or a bad film nut than give this a full five star review!Frankenstein's Daughter(1958) was the brain child of Director Richard Cunhaa director who could have given Ed Wood a run for his money as he directed some of the most hilariously awful Horror pictures of the 1950s including She Demons(1957) Giant From the Unknown(1957) and Missle to the Moon(1958).The idea for this film must have sprang from the idea that since Frankenstein already had a son(Universal's 1939 'Son of Frankenstein' which was a GOOD film) why not make a film about his daughter? Well Cunha and his writers made the same age old mistake of confusing the doctor's name with the Monsters'. So instead of a Crazy foxy female scientist we get what is supposed to be the female Monster of yet another insane male scientist in the family.This Frankenstein is played by Donald Murphy in one of the hammiest mad scientist roles of all time. Murphy's Frankenstein is a lecherous megalomaniac creep who likes to hit on young hot jail bait which he either drugs them with a serum that makes there faces look like a bad halloween mask or run over them with his car which after there curvy voluptous figures are magically transformed to resemble that of a muscle bound man!Murphy plays the role to the hilt and it's a shame that his supporting cast does not share the same enthusiasm.John Ashley does his best Wooden Indian impression as a hapless boyfriend of Sandra Knightwho is equally bad. Knight only amuses when popping out of her tight black bathing suit. Veteran actor Felix Locher may have been the worst elderly actor of the period hamming it up to a degree that would shame even Murphy's eye rolling!This film features many of the most unintentionally funny moments in genre history including the horrendous make-up designed for the Monster which according to Hollywood Legend WAS supposed to be a sexy female Monster but instead(and quite improbally) became hulking actor Harry Wilson(!) who is not remotely attractive and/or female.Sandra Knight is briefly turned into a oatmeal faced Monster who runs around with her bathing suit on(!) causing a newspaper headline to describe a 'Bathing suited Monster on the Loose!'.The death scenes are CLASSIC bad cinema including some guy that gets crushed in a door(what is he shouting before the Monster crushes him? Is it 'Ma!'?) and the admittebly violent demise of Murphy's character who gets gruesomely scalded with acid by the worst miss in Hollywood history courtesy of Non-Hero John Ashley.I should probally also note that Harold Lloyd Jr. is in this film singing a very bad song and telling some terrible jokes not quite on par with his gifted father.And with that noteplease proceed at your own risk Movie Maniacs and enjoy this stinking piece of Trash cinema from the Golden age of the Drive In Movie.

" 'The Story of a Man of Character' as described by Thomas Hardy is somewhat flaccidly applied to this novel. In fact a better description of this novel comes from a colleague of mine Professor Neale Scott of the Baltimore University who remarked 'I realise now I had mistaken the dullness of Henchard's character for the dullness of the whole novel.'. Ultimately Prof. Scott is quite accurate in his assessment of the text. The characters bumble around waiting for circumstance to attach itself to their groins and do very little of plausible importance at all. Henchard himself is without doubt one of the most irritating characters to be placed in 'classic' fiction and one can't help but wish that the death of our tragic hero had happened an awful lot sooner such as before the novel started. The character of Elizabeth-Jane wonderfully parodied by Helli Kitchin of the Moscow State University is so blase towards her constantly changing parenthood that it completely ruins any sense of empathy that the audience may have for her. The least convincing Scotsman ever can also be found in this text in the form of Donald Farfrae and I am inclined to agree with Dr Daniel Greenfeld whose thesis 'Hardy makes the heart grow colder' points out that the author would not know a Scotsman if one jumped up and bit him a way that most of us admittedly meet them. To sum up - I discourage my students from reading this shambolic text. Avoid this novel like the plague - it is so soggy you couldn't even burn it to stay warm. Attempt perhaps to read something a little more plausible with something other that a praetorian wanderer and an intransigent hay-trusser to tantalise the imagination something that the author was obviously lacking - Wessex indeed.

" Modern novels can be so pretentious with their needless philosophizing and conscious experimentation with the language. So isn't nice to read a classic novel with straight-forward writing that aims for no insight into society or people? Actually no it's kind of depressing. The Mayor of Casterbridge relies on coincidence melodrama and as the afterword in my edition puts it 'the constant exploitation of chance happenings to determine situation and hence the fate of his characters.' I chose this Hardy novel because it was supposed to be character-centered. The story starts with Michael Henchard selling his wife and child at a fair. I thought this book would examine his redemption it would be a Lord Jim type tale of profound psychological insight. A strange event like that is a good way to get a book started but the crazy unlikely events just keep a-coming. You feel nothing for the characters ever. You learn nothing in the end except life is cruel and if something can go wrong it will. Read something else. ",1.0

" I was very disappointed overall with this book. In particular the misinformation perpetuated by this author in the section on diet and nutrition was shocking. The author advocates 'free range' and 'more natural' animal products in place of tested safe chicken and dairy products. As a veterinarian and graduate of The Ohio State University College of Food Agriculture and Environmental Sciences I can testify that the quality of such 'natural' products is often much lower than their farm-grown counterparts. Furthermore the agricultural processes decried by this author in fact serve to make our food supply safer than ever before. Certainly this book does not present an 'expert' opinion nor does it provide safe and accurate information for the women who need it most. As far as the rest of the information in this book I found it outdated and in other cases inaccurate.

On the other hand if you're on bedrest considering using an epidural or even (gasp) a c-section this book will try to make you feel bad about it.Then there are the chapters about the long term psychological effect of having to share a womb. If you believe as the author does that you can remember back to the day you implanted as a little embryo in your mothers womb then you might think there's something to this. I just had to laugh.The author cites a lot of conflicting studies about twins and draws whatever conclusions she wants from them.

She implies that those carrying multiples many years ago gave birth to healthy 7-lb each infants with none of the problems that some of us having multiples face today. She is an advocate for veganism water births home births doulas and midwives and avoiding pain meds.

It focuses far too much on the negative aspects of having twins - loss of one twin preterm labor birth complications vanishing twin syndrome etc. It is daunting enough being pregnant with twins without reading a book that reminds me of all the things that can go wrong. In addition the author offers impractical advice on nutrition and exercise which in many cases is contrary to advice from the medical profession. Not everyone has the money or the desire to eat seaweed and other 'macrobiotic' health store food. All in all I would not recommend this book to any woman expecting twins. It is alarmist and out-of-touch with real pregnant women. ",1.0

My husband and I later attended a childbirth class for multiple births and one of the first things that the instructor told us was to NOT read this book. There are so many other books out there that do tell you the risks and the problems but manage to stay positive. Incidentally I never was put on bedrest my girls were born at 36 weeks they spent one night in NICU and came home with me three days later.

In fact I so dislike the book that I go out of my way to warn expectant parents of twins to avoid it. In addition the dietary advice is ridiculous and it's impossible for even a hearty eater to consume the massive amounts of food this writer claims are necessary to having a healthy baby.

" I purchased an Under Armour compression tee at a local store in a size Large. The shirt fit fantastic. I wanted a back up so I purchased this one online size Large different color. The shirt arrives on time open the package and it is a Large but does not even fit over my shoulders.... I contacted the vendor for an exchange. They do not do exchanges but will allow me to return the shirt. If the shirt was worn it has to be washed before returning it... no problem for I could not get the shirt on anyway so tags etc were all in place. If you pass 30 days there is a restocking fee of 20% which I was unaware of.When I questioned the vendor why I have a Large and ordered the same size it did not fit. The vendor stated that Under Armour has different sizing charts for different shirts. That just did not make sense. How are you to buy a product with 'floating' sizes.So I went online to Nordstrum to find the same exact heat guard compression tee. There was a size chart that could be pulled up to check size before ordering.... only 1 chart for Under Armour. I did all the measurements correctly to find that I was to order a Large.I know the shirt fits tight but since I already HAD a large that fits and the chart from Under Armor at Nordstrum confirmed that I had ordered the correct shirt size the statement that there are different size charts for different Under Armour shirts ' just doesn't fit!'.I personally will visit a store and actually try it on to avoid the hassle and disappointment of waiting for a product that does not fit seemingly was ordered correctly and then had to be mailed back.

" On their first three albums the Soft Machine were one of the real gems of the psychedelic and then progressive rock scene. Whereas far too many psychedelic bands tried to make it with vocalists who were quite unsuited to the sounds which they were aiming to make and many progressive bands could never play in such a manner as to attract attention the Soft Machine never fell prey to any of those problems. Their music always had a deep feeling to it and the vocals of Robert Wyatt and Kevin Ayers were always truly touching and at times even funny.OnThird the band with a new lineup changed tack completely but to no less effect on three of the sides. In doing so they provided part of the blueprint for such movements as the 1990s post-rock sound with fierce bass work and the unique saxophone playing of Elton Dean.However on the second side 'Slightly All the Time' there was some suggestion that the Soft Machine could lose the plot - and on 'Fourth' and 'Fifth' it is no understatement to say that they did so in a more dramatic manner than could ever have been imagined. Gone is the touching drumming of Wyatt and the intense bass lines that carried so much of 'Third' and in their place are sounds that could have come from almost any jazz-rock band and have utterly no emotional impact let alone the capacity to make a listener want to listen repeatedly. Elton Dean's saxophone work is even more prominent than it was on 'Slightly All the Time' but lacks the balance Hugh Hopper's fierce bass playing provided so wonderfully on 'Facelift' and 'Out-Bloody-Rageous'.Worse still is how the music on 'Fourth' and 'Fifth' seems to drift through a listener as if it were the worst kind of elevator music played with very little interruption. The saxophone sound is also so typical of the worst kind of 1970s jazz-rock as to be distinctly dated.All up this is a case of a band seemingly losing everything in one step just asThird Ear Banddid around the same time with theMacBeth soundtrack. Stick with their first three albums. ",1.0

" Without a doubt this has to be most boring apocalyptic zombie horror book I have ever had the misfortune to read.The story starts off promising enough with an unknown virus which kills millions and nicely introdcues us to the characters but thats where it ends. The rest of the story is taken up with them finding somewhere to live and going out for supplies.The author does a good job of trying to convey the shock and disbelief of surviving such an event but it is overdone. 200 pages into a book I dont want the characters still sitting around in a state of shock.It seems as if David Moody started to write the first few chapters which evolved into a whole book but the early chapters never ended.At no point did I care about any of the characters because they were two dimensional. We learnt very little of their back stories so I never connected with them.Now onto the zombies OMG without doubt these are the most unscary monsters I have ever come across. They dont do anything but walk around and bumb into things. Its obvious that the trio are never really in danger from them. I also find it hard to believe that in todays world if you saw the dead rising and walking around the word zombie would not pop into your head but it seems as if the protagnists in the book are oblivious to the fact that these dead people are indeed zombies.Save your money and buy World War Z.

" Autumn isn't a zombie novel. That's something you'll have to figure out pretty quickly. Sure there are corpses that get up wander around and bump into things but that's really about all they do for over half the book. Instead the focus is on a group of three completely unlikable (and frankly hard to keep track of because they all talk exactly the same way) 'survivors' whose names I won't even bother mentioning.Essentially the premise is that a virus sweeps the world (I assume) randomly killing...well just about everyone. The few left (in the unidentified 'English' city this story takes place in about thirty people out of half a million are left unaffected) band together at a community center with flimsy walls (this exposition is set up rather ludicrously early on and there's not even a pay off) the dead start rising and people start to panic. Unfortunately it's really hard to figure out why everyone immediately goes into survival mode (people panic at the site of a mob of undead only to learn they've simply gotten themselves hung up on a parked car) since the zombies while obviously dead aren't initially any more deadly than the average pot head or dementia patient. They shuffle around and bump into things they freeze up whenever anyone touches them etc. The irrational level of fear people have for them would seem to indicate people have been watching BBC's midnight zombie flick marathon except no one ever seems to make the zombie connection (Moody apparently subscribes to the theory that zombie fiction is best when the word zombie never appears). While I don't really care what you call the undead (be it skels Deadites zombies Darkseekers or whatever) I at least a reason for everyone to be afraid of them.For over half of its over 300 page length we get a series of repetitive sequences that don't really move the plot along all the while mobile corpses (it seems to cheat the term to call them zombies or even undead) wander around in the shadows. True scenes of zombies in the distance do make for an eerie atmosphere (Resident Evil Apocalypse and Dawn of the Dead's far superior remake manage this beautifully) but since for most of Autumn that's all the dead even do it quickly stops being scary (at least for me if not the characters themselves) and starts just being loopy.Let's talk about the characters themselves. Autumn has quite a large cast of them all of whom Moody seems to feel duty bound to name but none of whom really matter. There are however three main survivors. One man has lost his wife and daughter (his only unique feature and one which Moody will keep pounding into us long after it gets old) another man (who I really can't remember anything at all about and I gave up on this book yesterday over 150 pages in) and a woman whose response to this nightmare at first was to simply crawl into bed pull up the covers and wish everything would go away. There are a host of tertiary characters as well such as the man in the first chapter who succumbs to the plague (since he never comes back as a zombie it seems rather pointless to have this scene at all since we get not one but about a dozen similar scenes through the eyes of our survivors) another man who starts off looking for a gas station and quickly reveals himself to be a massive prick two rather pointless old women two equally pointless young women (who both sob a lot) and several others who are fortunately only present briefly only to be eaten off screen when the extremely flimsy building they all stupidly took shelter in ('I can push the walls apart!' announces a main character rather pointlessly early on which terrifies the others for no reasons since there's no danger from outside at this point and is to foreshadowing what a three year-old's finger painting is to Monet). We knew this was going to happen the minute our three main characters left the only problems with the scene are how badly it's set up and the fact that it all occurs off page (including the aftermath) meaning we don't even get to see the results of the suddenly not friendly zombies as they devour everyone. This is frankly a shame since the long and plodding scenes leading up to this deserve SOME sort of pay-off but they really don't ever get any as is the case with this novel as a whole.It's hard to keep the characters straight mainly because they have such a narrow range of personality",1.0

" I have to say man I agree with the 'Boring' guy!

Well at this point in the story the only fight for survival these three charecters have faced is driving around in a van. Nothing at this point has threatened them heck they haven't even run out of gas. This is half-way through the book mind you.As a stand alone story if you have never read any zombie fiction ...it still kinda sucks. If you have read basically anything else say Brian Keene's 'The Rising' for example or Robert Kirkman's 'The Walking Dead' comics then I have a hard time thinking you will like this light weight attempt that reads like it was written by a freshman in high school (albeit a freshman that probably made a fair amount of coin off of the ignorant masses. Someone said this is being made into a movie? Man I'm in the wrong line of work!)One bit of respect for the author- this first book in the series is available as a PDF on his website so at least you don't have to pay for it.

" I was quite disappointed after reading Autumn. Maybe it was the large anticipation I had incorporated when purchasing the book thinking that post-apocalyptic scenarios were 'my kind of thing' (and they still are). However Moody's book was very poorly written. Not only did I encounter numerous grammatical mistakes but there was absolutely no connection with the characters. It was almost like 'here are the characters now you must try and relate to them and follow through with their overly obvious situations.' I felt no sympathy with Carl's death or any other middle school -written events that occurred. Overall this was a terrible book in the sense that there was no captivation whatsoever. Although the abysmal stance of Autumn Moody is an amateur and will hopefully progress in later writings. ",1.0

I grew weary of the snarky way the characters were in the beginning when they were all still in the one depressing building together. I expected things to pick up after Emma Mike and Carl struck out on their own but that didn't happen either.One of the best series I've read (zombie themed) was the 'As the World Dies' trilogy by RhiannonFrater. Those books were fast paced full of action and intrigue and the characters were interesting. Plus it also made you think about how mankind really WOULD react if some similar apocalypse occurred. I CARED about the characters in that story and immediately downloaded the second and third books in this series after reading the first. I WON'T be doing that with the 'Autumn' series. ",1.0
" I felt like I was reading the outline for the book and not the actual end result. Like if the author of the Dick and Jane series wrote a zombie story this is what it would be like. I kept on though despite the many many frustrating and confusing misprints typos and grammatical errors because I am in desperate need of zombie reading material. It was slow and annoying because the characters in the book seemed to all be like minded in the sense that there were always ONLY two options and never any more and the zombies don't cause any threat at all until like the last 3 chapters and even then the threat is minimal.Why read a zombie novel only to have the story based on the emotions of the characters and their incredibly uncreative brains and not the trails and thrills of survival in a dooms day like setting? I mean that's what draws me to zombie fiction in the first place... I assume I am not alone in this.All in all I was very disappointed with the story and hope for more books to come out like Justin Cronin's The Passage and the Max Brooks novel World War Z. Also if anyone happening to read this knows of more books similar to the ones I just put out there please do me a favor and comment on this review with the info as I am always interested in quality zombie reading material!",1.0

" I honestly fear for mankind after hearing this album. Even more so I worry about everyone who loves it so much. If you're finding absolutely anything about this album to be inspiring exceptional unique or even GOOD in the slightest (with one exception which I'll get to later) you obviously haven't heard nearly enough REAL music and obviously have been inducted into the Mindless Drones With Money to Burn Hall of Fame.Moby's formula is to take a sample loop it and add drums. He does this over and over again. There are no exceptions. For some reason people find this 'deep'.Some tracks are 'ambient'--otherwise known as 'narcoleptic'. When a song absolutely DOES NOT CHANGE for four minutes--and what's there to begin with is hardly exciting--it's left the realm of true ambient music and gone into sleep-inducing terrifyingly bad hype.As for the 'deeper meaning' behind this obvious attempt to [put] out yet another commercialized sellout record (not like he had any talent whatsoever to begin to sell out with) simply put--there is none! Where are people finding meaning and substance in 'why does my heart feel so bad' repeated over and over for 3 minutes? Where is the purpose and direction in 'gunnahunnagumbay'?The lone exception to this rule is the exceptional song 'everloving'--download that and enjoy because if you're looking for that kind of music you'll most likely hate the rest of the album.If you want to listen to real music that actually has substance unlike this amateur [stuff] listen to Delerium's album Karma...

Simply put it sounds great. It is catchy and upbeat and has great music. I loved this song. But the rest of the album isn't as skillfully made.Songs like 'Run On' 'Honey' 'Bodyrock' and 'Natural Blues' COULD have been great but are weighed down by excessive repetition. Eventually it gets to be too much and I don't even listen to those songs. Listen to the 30 second samples of those songs...and you have it all.And then to top it off there are those songs that are just completely horrible. I'm not sure if 'Down Slow' or 'Inside' can even be called songs. They don't really seem to have any sort of structure just a few minutes of drum machine beats and wavering background music. They are just no fun at all to listen to.Get 'South Side' off of iTunes and leave it at that. ",1.0

" I'll try to be even handed about this album. On one hand I accept it is very pleasing to the ear and has sold millions of copies. But does that make it a good album?To many people I'm sure it does but to me it doesn't. For in essence all Moby has done is taken samples of old blues tracks and placed a drumloop and some piano melodies underneath there's nothing good about that. In fact it's very very lazy.Now I do accept he has done it very well but that doesn't change my opinion. I'm not totally against sampling but he does it on nearly every track with no use of innovation then what's the point? At least DJ Shadow knows how to 'use' a sample.The way Moby has shamelessly sold the rights of every track on this album bar one to advertisers means also you have probably heard every track already therefore you may not need to purchase this 'recycled' album.Well of course it's upto you but I prefer the originals!

" First of all the rhythms of the album are not even remotely close to being compatible with dancing. And if any of them are you wouldn't want to dance to them anyway. After reading the introduction to my critique I'm sure the other 196 people that reviewed this album and gave it 5 stars are saying 'it's not about dancing...it brings out emotions' and a whole bunch of other hooey. Okay great...but stick it in another category like blues or gospel. This album has no business being the number 1 dance/dj pick whatsoever. How this album has anything to do with techno is beyond my understanding which is probably attributed to the fact that this album is NOT techno. I wouldn't even call it electronica. It's more of a fusion between blues and synth sounds in an attempt to reflect how depressed this person feels. If you're looking for emotional music in the genre of electronica I suggest CAFE DEL MAR VOL. 5 or UNDERWORLD which fits more in the realm of techno than MOBY does.Don't misinterpret my words.... I'm not saying this music isn't good. It's just that this isn't a dance/dj album...and it may mislead those of us who enjoy genuine techno house and trance. This is just a warning to anyone who finds this album being promoted in the techno section.I'm sure all of the other people that reviewed this album giving it five stars will mark the 'not helpful' circle on my critique as they did to the other people who gave this album a bad review.

Any CD that during your third time listening to it you start skipping to the next track halfway through the song because you've HEARD ENOUGH OF THE SAME THING ALREADY needs to get dropped off at your nearest CD trading post ASAP.

" If you're expecting a book that details the authors in-depth experiences with Benedictine spirituality or a how-to book on retreats. Then this is not the book for you. This book should have been called 'The Cloister-Lite Walk'. And as a Catholic I found this book to be very offensive.This book centers on the happenings of the author's daily life with a sprinkling of her 'not-so much about' experiences with Benedictine spirituality where all of the chapters are laid out according to the Liturgical year (Saints days / feasts days).For Catholic's looking for some insight on Benedictine spirituality and retreats...be forewarned. This book is written by an author who claims to have returned to her Protestant roots and wants to share how Benedictine spirituality has had an influence on her life.But if you scratch past the surface of this you will find that contained in the book are stories of Benedictine religious who are not in the least faithful to the teachings of the Catholic church.For example on page 12 she speaks of a monk named David....'he purchased an amulet of a whale's fluke... The woman who sold it to him said it had been blessed by a Methodist bishop but he could also take it to a priest of the old religion. 'I did' he said. 'It cost me a six-pack of beer and a carton of cigarettes'You will also find ALOT of ANTI-CATHOLIC BIAS in this book. The author states that the writings of Saint Jerome cause modern women to think that 'women must be either virgins or whores either blessed or cursed while men are simply sexual athletes slaves of lust'. (page 24)Assumes that in the hospital where she was born that the nuns being who they are 'one of them may have baptized me in secret' (page 88) That celibacy in the Catholic church should show us how 'we need only look at newspaper accounts of sex abuse by priests to see that celibacy isn't working' (page 116).The author shows her true ignorance as to the origins of the sex abuse scandal. I recommend that readers get ahold of the book 'Goodbye Good Men' by Michael S. Rose which shows that celibacy is far from being the reason why the horrors of the abuse of children by priests occurred.The author then takes a much-loved Catholic saint 'Maria Goretti' and reduces her to nothing more than a virgin-patsy used by the Catholic Church just like Marilyn Monroe was by those she knew in her life and states that Maria Goretti 'in a curious way she reminds me of Marilyn Monroe' (page 223). On top of this she agrees with what was said in article on Maria Goretti that states 'that a woman was better dead than raped'.... And by canonizing her the church has seemed to many to agree.' (page 224)The author appears to think that it would have been better if Maria Gorretti allowed herself to be raped and shouldn't have defended her virginity. This kind of liberalism trying to pass as a book showing her respect towards Benedictine spirituality whilst at the same time throwing out her little anti-Catholic jabs is reason enough for any devoted Catholic to pass on this book.A final example of her anti-Catholicism is the chapter entitled 'Women and the Habit",1.0

" If anyone is actually looking for a true tale of the plight of California Indians don't bother to look at Jackson's novel.It is inherently racist written by a woman who doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same likes as Upton Sinclair or Harriet Beecher Stowe.On one of her visits to California Jackson called the Native Americans she saw 'loathsome abject and hideous.' In her novel she doesn't stray far from this inherent indignation of another race. In fact she most likely had no idea she was being racist another reason entirely why this book should be burned. ALternately thorughout the book Jackson refers to the indians Ramona and ALlesandro encounter as 'patient creatures' (16) 'poor creatures' (20) 'wild creatures' (47) 'faithful creatures' (353) 'miserable creatures' (324) 'vagabond bands' (286) 'like beasts' without the Christianizing presence of the Missions (231). are they human? possibly. are they equal to the pastoral spanish who enslaved them that Jackson venerates so much? most definitely not.Secondly ALlesandro could be the most anglicized Indian ever. He is most assurredly an abberation physically looked like a mexican was the most devout catholic lives in a house that is like any mexican villa. INdeed Jackson remarks that 'There were not many such Indians as Allesandro and his Father. If there had been it would have been better for their people' (327) and that he 'almost makes one forget he is an Indian.' (101).also she refuses to create an interracial love story. the whole crappy book is predicated on the fact that Ramona is half indian. only when she is indian can she fulfill Jackson's debased notion of racial determinism.Besides the myriad moral reasons why this book is so terrible it could be the most groandiose verbose and pooorly written romance book EVER. the characters lack any moral ambiguity which would make for interesting characterization and are constantly marked by sweeping romantic gestures that could better be classified as trash fiction than a literary classic.You'd find more entertainment from reading the yellow pages than wasting your time.

" I have no idea why this film is practically out of print & why it's so expensive when it's so indescribably awful. I also have no idea why so many people love this film. I purchased a copy of it recently to see what the hype was all about (e.g. the rumor floating around that it had a lot of sex in it & my parents forbidding my older sisters to see it in the '80's. This was surprising since my parents were pretty lenient in letting us watch almost every movie we wanted to when my sisters & I were growing up). To my dismay the sex scenes really didn't show that much. The only decent things I can say is that the cinematography is good (e.g. the orange lighting in the scenes where Jade (Brooke Shields) & David (Martin Hewitt) are making love. Martin Hewitt is great eye-candy for the female viewers in this film.The film's not even so bad it's good. I did recently watch 'I Love the '80's Strikes Back 1981' on VH-1 & was amused by how awful the stars on the show said it was & the jokes they made about it. The acting is awful by everybody & no one is really likable in the film. Jade's parents are morons. The father tries to be cool & smoke grass & drink alcohol with the kids. He usually ends up making a fool out of himself dancing around idiotically. Basically he's only nice when he's under the influence. Jade's mom struggles to sputter out easy sentences & sayings souding like a child learning Hooked on Phonics & is so sex-starved that she tries to pull an a la Graduate & make it with David. Jade's older brother (James Spader) is not happy with David dating Jade even though he introduced the two!Brooke Shields disturbs me in this film. I always got the feeling that she was exploited in this film (as she was in many others when she was young e.g. Pretty Baby as a 12-year-old prostitute The Blue Lagoon in which she's way too young to be wearing barely nothing & having sex) as some unstable young nymphomaniac who acts much younger than 15. This is especially evident in the rape scene that was so nauseating I had to fast forward past it. It's long after David has intentionally set fire to Jade & her family's house & they meet up again a couple of years later & he rapes her making her demand over & over again to proclaim his love to her & she's crying. Afterwards she's still on his bed acting flirty & nonchalant as if nothing happened. What a f@#%*# up scene!After the scene I just mentioned I kept on fast forwarding through the film to stop the madness & because I really didn't care what would happen. I just wanted it to end. Does it have a point? Maybe it does - that arson will not win back the heart of the girl you love? Or maybe that obsessive love will most likely & almost always lead to tragic consequences? But who really cares any way? I suggest you save your money & rent better films about obsessive love like the uncensored version of 9 1/2 Weeks & the 1st version of Romeo & Juliet. ",1.0

" This film is inconsistent in many ways. Set up as a forbidden love story between two teen agers bitterly opposed by the father of the girl the film stops making sense that you realize that the girl's family is supposed to be a bunch of progressive ex-hippies who encourage their children to experiment and hold wildest parties on the block. Why hate the kid when he is trying so desperately to become part of the clan? The enemy number two is the girl's brother who happens to be this guy's best friend who introduced him to his sister in the first place!Beyond that the film starts falling apart. Father forbids them to see each other for a month because of the girl's failing grades and the kid goes bonkers and sets the house on fire. The obvious question is why aren't they talking in school and what sort of friendship is it that can't survive a thirty day separation? Unless the guy is obssessed with the girl and the girl is not interested.Whatever merits the original novel had got lost in this screen adaptation. No reason for the attraction is given nor does the film show any relationship between the two beyond sexual attraction. The girl's folks are not at all recognizable as former hippies but you can definitely see traces of old world aristocracy in them with the duck hunting and with pretensions to preppiness and upper classdom why then did they introduce the kid to the girl in the first place by a jealous brother no less???Finally the film disgisted me because the guy is clearly a stalker and the girl is objectified and the whole affair is shown as GREAT LOVE! On a couple of occasions the guy forces himself on the unwilling girl and they explode into passionate lovemaking. In the final analysis the message in the film validates every stalker in that the object of their obssession will yield to them in the end if only they get through to her against all odds and against all reason. Except in this story the stalker is the hero and a victim. ",1.0
" You have to be kidding! Maybe endless therapy is a more telling title!Though the book was an international bestseller the movie is only a shadow of what Scott Spencer wrote. Endless Love had the potential to be another Love Story but Franco Zeffirelli didn't pull it off. Perhaps the passage of time makes the film seem shallow and morbid in its sappiness but what comes out on the screen is two love-crazed teenagers driven to distraction. A 15-year-old girl is best off forging a solid core identity and not having emotional turbulence that young romantic love provokes. A 17-year-old boy about to graduate high school should be looking towards his future. The parents are as much to blame in the story line for their lack of guidance and misunderstanding about the overwhelming feelings teenage hormones have on adolescent minds.If you like sappy romance without the strength of acting dialogue and a decent story....

" Watching t.v. late at night (or too early in the morning)? 'Doppelganger' might be just the right b-movie to keep you occupied. It's interesting enough to make you wonder what exactly is going on but cheesey enough towards the end to make you understand exactly why it's played at 3 in the morning. George Newbern is the best feature of the movie fine acting and seems to be too good for the movie itself. Drew Barrymore(we all know how much she has improved since 'Doppelganger'and I personally think she is a great actress. That having been said-)leaves so very much to be desired. She has an awkward deliverence of her lines but most of the fault I suspect lies in the story itself. The movie appears to be getting good by the middle by falls short at the end. Almost as if it was given to two different writers to finish and neither ending was cut. Overall worth watching for a thrill a laugh or Newbern's acting. ",1.0
" I enjoy movies with Drew Barrymore but this movie must have had the lowest budget ever! Through most of the movie you are not sure of the outcome.

" I give this film 5 stars. This and The Princess and the Warrior are in my top 10 all time favorites.This is less a review than advice to those that may be influenced by the 1 star reviews.

These reviewers said it themselves- they didn't get it.During the movie the song What a Difference a Day Makes is played both to create atmosphere and to send a message. One of the main points of the movie is to show what a difference precious seconds can make..Cheers.P.S.Hopefully this sheds some light for the 1 star reviewers as well but I doubt it. ",1.0

Sound familiar? This film is so incredibly bad that when I watched it with two of my cousins we cried laughing so hard. This is one of the cheapest (if the not the cheapest) slasher flick of all time. It's the first movie that I've ever seen that has a full grown man screaming like a small toddler girl! Also why is this movie so incredibly 80's as compared to other slasher movies? Everyone has a mullet or some kind of bad hair and they all drive the same beat-up car!

The first one was strangely compelling and I found the second one on sale cheap but I should have honestly stopped there.There is nothing really scary about these 'bodies.' They are weak and decaying. A few well-placed molotov cocktails applied regularly would have finished this series at book two (or sooner). Presumably the bodies are not reproducing. Eventually efforts at getting rid of them would pay off.There is nothing scary about this book that is except the hypnotic repetitiveness of the narration. If I read one more time the long drawn-out explanation of why the bodies were amassing near the survivors I think perhaps I might have turned into a zombie-like creature myself.I remain flabbergasted that so many people appear to have thought this book was worth 4+ stars.

The addition of walk-on parts for Bob Dylan and Gerald Ford only makes it more unreal. Nor to I need an unbelievable series of disasters from sink holes to collapsing houses to freeway kidnaps to a Los Angeles firestorm to try to inject some plot into this unfocused story.

" I must agree with Schroedinger that this is a poorly written book. It seems that novices who've only seen one or two quantum physics texts in their lives fall for the smooth talking style of Griffiths. Don't fall for it! For example the section on angular momentum and spin is one of the worst I've ever read. Griffiths gets the reader lost in a heap of math without taking the time to describe the picture behind it. (I'm not complaining about the level of math in the book but his failure in communicating the physical insight or feeling of quantum phenomena.)Even the small book by Paul Davies is better written and more insightful than Griffiths.My personal recommendations are the Feynman Lectures on Physics (volume III) and Introduction to the Quantum Theory by David Park (even Griffiths acknowledges in his own text that Park is an excellent book). After these two you may want to hit Shankar or Sakurai. (As I said above the book by Davies is pretty good too.) ",1.0

This book needs to be discontinued! ",1.0
" This text is much like Griffith's intro to electrodynamics. If you don't need to learn anything and just want a simple answer to basic questions buy this book. If however you are taking a class in quantum mechanics don't waste your money. Griffith brings up interesting questions without ever answering them. He offers no assistance in solving the more demanding problems which would aid the learning process. If you're majoring in physics stay away from Griffith as a whole. Rholf is a much better publisher and writer. Check out his texts if you're serious about an education. ",1.0
" I can't understand why Mr. Griffiths' undergraduate physics books are so popular. The low intellectual level of his writing can only discourage more advanced students yet the physics is so watered down that you won't learn much anyways. His books read like a 'Physics For Dummies' series.Griffiths' Quantum Mechanics book continues in this tradition. He introduces Schroedinger's Equation on the FIRST page without giving any of the traditional 'plausibility arguments'. He bypasses any discussion of the Old Quantum Theory (Bohr's Correspondence Principle and the Bohr-Summerfeld quantization conditions). He gives a watered down introduction to the Dirac formalism which fails to adequately explain Dirac's measurement theory and such important concepts as simultaneous eigenkets and non-commuting observables.There are innumerable superior QM books at the undergraduate level. Save your money and forget about Griffiths. ",1.0

" While Golding is correct in that there is a dark side to human nature he is a fool for having created such an implausible plot.Boys of that age rarely attack people under any circumstances.Instaed they use more subtle forms of psychological warfare.They could only have acted like that if they had had to eat each other to survive.

" Golding's idea was brilliant. He delved into the true hidden nature of humans; our origin as an animal. In his book a group of young boys are stranded on an island without any adults. They set up a society with rules goals and a leader. Of course this society fails miserably. Rules are disregared goals are forgotten and the leader is overthrown. Their miniature civilization degrades into chaos. The implication is that civilization as a whole is just a thin mask that covers our more primal nature.The idea is well thought out and interesting. However Golding focuses on the details of the boys' existance and the symbolism of the story to the point that the story itself is lost. The only remotely interesting part is the end when he stops focusing on the symbolism as much and lets the story drive home the points that he tries to make throughout the book.If you want an examination of human nature then read this book.If you want an adventure story look elsewhere. ",1.0
" This book doesn't deserve a review. With all due respect Golding couldn't write a good book to save his life. His writing is reminiscent of Tolkien's; he comes up with a great story and then ruins it with horrible writing.

In his 'Inner Circle' there are some other boys",1.0

All in all it was a hell of a book to those who actually like reading books. To tell the truth I hardly remember what the book was about. ",1.0

But I however did not like the book for the sole reason of the killings and how the boys felt no remorse at all except for Ralph.

The author tries to show how society works and what would happen if a group of young boys were stranded on an island but fails miserably. His opinion of what would happen is just wrong. And even if you do agree (once you've read the book) the writing still destroys the book. It is such a slow book! Way too much unnecassary details!

" It's interesting to see how cynical a successfull author can be and how popular such cynicism can be. Lord of the Flies might be a suspenseful and thought-provoking book but it's main thesis --children turning into beasts as soon as the burden of civilization is taken off them-- is utterly silly. It makes me wonder how many children Mr. William Golding really knew or talked to before writing this book. Children are always capable (many times much more than grownups) to act with common-sense and responsibility. I think Mr. Golding knew this (he can't be that narrow-minded) but simply choose to forget it since it would destroy his thesis and he wouldn't be able to write this novel. It's also fun to see how easily some authors can ignore or blur the most simple realities. I don't recommend this book to anyone who loves children and childhood which is a period of exploration and friendships. ",1.0

" 'The lord of the flies' By william Golding is in my opinion one of the most boring book i have ever read in my whole life. but on the other hand it did have alot to say about our 'humanly nature' most of it was true.This book was like a little summary of our violent nature throughout history.

" In all honesty 'Lord of the Flies' is probably the most painfully boring story (and I use that word loosely) that I have ever had the misfortune of reading. The plot is simple and the characters are presented in a way that makes them difficult to enjoy reading about. The book is around 150 pages which is strange seeing that it took me about three weeks to finish because I had to will my eyes to lurch over every page. Other than it being the most uninteresting book one can find the characters make me equally angry. I realize just as well as the next person that they're stuck on an island and that they're all younger than me but these children are just unimaginably dense throughout the story. They become so out of touch with reality that they even take to hunting down their leader. What am I supposed to find symbolic and interesting about that? People keep going on about how this book is teaming with symbolism but I'm just not seeing it just because you have a bunch of kids stranded on an island doesn't mean that that relates to religion society etc. Aside from the characters annoying me at a personal level the way the author portrays them is even more ridiculous. If William Golding spent half as much time on the plot and not describing the children and scenery he may have had a half-decent story on his hands. If someone is looking for a decent book about survival try 'The Stand' by Stephen King at least he made it interesting to read. ",1.0

Golding's novel is very horrendous in the fact his absolutely mind-numbing style immediately drove me away in his tedious and unnecessary description that wasn't even striking in any way. I'll give it a bit for having good description in a few places but only a miniscule few.But that isn't even the reason for this rating. What I found most unpleasantly apalling was the content of this so-called classic. It completely and utterly disappointed me in its horrific plot that I wouldn't even care to mention. Am I a happy-go-lucky reader? No; In fact I quite often enjoy the sad and angry scenes in many novels but an element of this one that I still can't quite name and don't care to that made those scenes so obtuse. This book should be completely wiped off and eradicated from the lists of classics to read and analyze in schools. ",1.0

And unless I'm forgetting something there's no suggestion whatsoever that aliens or supernatural intruders are secretly present on the island. I don't know I guess there's just a lot of missed opportunity in this book. Maybe whoever wrote it should think about some revisions? Because as it is there's really not much to it except a searing journey into mostly unanswerable questions about what it is to be human. ",1.0

But I find it hard to admit that it could be quiet as much as Mister Golding portrays. There are also some nice little descriptions about a bunch of savage boys dying very painful deaths and I wonder why anyone would title their book after a pig's head speared on a stick. ???????

" The book starts out pretty quickly and anyone reading it could probably catch on pretty quickly. There has been a plane crash and the only survivors are a number of British boys ages 4 to about 14. Soon after they realize that they are on an uninhabited island and that they must rely on themselves to survive and to get rescued. Upon arriving at the island they have a group meeting and when Ralph is voted chief of the island Jack is left as an also-ran. That's something what I liked about this novel the whole idea of children being captive on an island living of pigs and fruit and trying to maintain a civilization with order and authority all by themselves.However I am surprised that I actually finished this book. This book is beyond the most boring and dull book in the world. It seems as if William Golding spend weeks on each paragraph and dialogue just to sound so 'absolutely intellectual to the highest extent'. From the looks of it I'd say that he tried way too hard to impress his Oxford college friends. Unless if you are really into the symbolism or if you have a master's degree with an English major then you would have been able to understand everything in this book. From every significant event to every detail expressed about the children's actions or their surroundings it is better to have Cliff Notes by your side if you wanted to catch every little segment of symbolism and importance.

" I hated this book! It was full of blunt unequivocal sybolism. I think that is one of the major problems; every few sentences you discover a new oddity that is supposed to directly link itself to the majority of underlying human disposition. However I found that most of these allegories just didn't quite manifest as true on the whole. Golding has taken simple facts and drastically over-exaggerated them. My second point is that the characters seem underdeveloped and because of this I found myself wishing they would all die off and then just maybe a more interesting story could arise. Perhaps I had more trouble relating than others might because of the fact that i am not living in the time period of the book and that all of the characters were boys younger than myself. You see I am in 10th grade and had to read this book last year for my english class (and by the way I read many many books in my spare time). I found all of the main personae in this book caustically unlikable (as I said before I found myself wishing they were all dead). I also think it is sad that this book is so repetitive through the whole book the troupe was splitting... then there was one well the rest couldn't have that so they try to kill him and aside from actually saying who went with which group and when and why the boys' monologue seemed to be 'what is the other tribe doing?' 'what will we eat tonight?' 'when and how can we be rescued?' etcetera. This did not fit well with the consistent symbolism and was not very well integrated into the story. Ok well all grumbling aside the last two chapters were at very least full of action but of course i was dissapointed that they didn't all perish in the end of the book. I suppose though to each thier own because this is definitely a love it/ hate it type of book. I do not recommend this to anyone who likes to relate to books in any way but if you must read it at least it is fairly short... ",1.0
" In my opinion this is one of the most boring books ever written. Sure Golding is trying to make a point about power's effect on social stability and structure but it is lost in the mumbo jumbo style that he writes with. (The movie is also a pathetic depiction of this cliche-ish message.) There are so many books out there that deal with this same topic and because of this common subject matter a novelist needs to be truly inventive to create a real masterpiece. This book should not be ranked anywhere near the top 100 novels on the Modern Library Association's list of the best novels of the 20th century. ",1.0
" Perhaps it is because of my age I'm nearing 23 that I find this work so to quote someone from the board atrocious.This book is absolutely boring and hadn't it been for my friend's reference I would not have bought iT!!! The setting is an island; the cast is a bunch of stranded 6 to 13 year olds. The major characters are Jack Merridew (the bully) Piggy (the dweeb) and Ralph (The chief and someone in between).Lord of the Flies is a journey of civilised minds turning savage. Everything starts off hunky dory as the children realise they have the whole island to themselves and that no adult is there to govern their behaviour. Everything begins in a civil manner",1.0
" As a response to one of the reviews that speaks quite highly of this novel I would like to say that despite my understanding and comprehension of the book I still found it entirely dull boring and a waste of my time. Since it was required of me to read this book in school I was forced to make my way through each dragging chapter but I would have never on my own time and it's not because I didn't understand the book that I feel this way about it. My class discussed quite thouroughly about the book's symbolism which was Golding's intention to start out with. Despite its hidden meanings the novel still remains absolutely ridiculous in the sense that these young British boys turn completely salvage and kill their fellow islanders. If the book was looked at through a totally symbolic perspective it would make more sense but in order to understand its symbolism one still has to read it and it is really not worth it. ",1.0
" Lord of the Flies showcases the idea that we are empty canasters being filled by environments and echoes the haunting statement that children are capable of immoral acts. Perhaps it uses the Robinson Crusoe idea of isolation.I do think as inspirational as Lord of the Flies has been that it's an overblown overrated affair and that Golding wrote other more powerful works such as Darkness Visible. The problem for me lies in the difficulties of using children as main characters while writing from an adult point of view. Difficult to relate to harder to realistically decribe a child's feelings and emotions because psychologically the author is on another level (even though the novel's fiction). On the other hand Golding's style is attractively fluent in that you want to find out what happens next and that's always a good sign for a classic read. ",1.0
" I have recently went through the extremely torturous chore of reading this novel in my eleventh grade English class. I hated this book so much that I went up to my teacher and told her exactly what I thought of this abysmal piece of work. Guess who wasn't too happy. I've heard so many great things about this book so I just couldn't wait to start it. 'Yeah Lord of the Flies great!' From the first page I hated it. This book is so hard to follow. I read a page. Then I think to myself 'What the heck was that?' I read the page again and only got a vague impression of what was going on and struggling to figure out what William Golding was trying to get across to the reader. Sure its possible to figure it out but how can you really enjoy a novel if you have to strain your brain to be able to get the badly told story into your mind and keep it there. I disliked this book so much that I removed the cover and glued it on upside down before I gave it back to my teacher. ",1.0
" I think Golding really screwed up on this one...I found the plot really boaring and unrealistic. There were too many characters and most were undeveloped. And just when I thought the novel was the worst thing I ever encountered I saw the old black and white Lord of Flies Movie. I really honestly think that a three-year old directed this...P-U. ",1.0
" My favorite chapter in this book would definitely be the first chapter when the kids are introduced on the island. There was this one kid that everyone had called piggy. To me that is the funniest thing in the world. I don't know why but the humiliation of another kid is extremely hilarious. It may seem cruel but to me it's funny. I would have to say that this book was definitely for the older more mature kids like high school kids. All in all I would have to say that even with the kid getting humiliated I dislike this book with a passion it is way to boring and just when you think it's going to get good the book disappoints you and I don't think that is a very good book for the serious reader ",1.0
" When I first picked up this book I was expecting a masterpiece-a work of outstanding literature. After all I had only heard great things about it. However I was extremely disappointed once I ventured on to read past the first chapter. Slowly I progressed onward making my way through endless descriptions multiple plots and enough symbolism to make my head ache. I think Mr.Golding should have remembered that not ONLY are themes important to keep the reader's interest but PLOT is too. This book is an excellent example of how someone can get so lost in the hidden meaning of their words they forget what they're trying to SAY in the first place. Not only are their problems with the actual structure of the book but also in the language used. There is a wide variety of slang used which is for the most part chiefly British! I found myself rereading sentences more than two times just to understand what was being said. By half-way through the book I actually wanted to stop and start reading something else. Also throughout the book Mr.Golding leaves off on one note and starts a completely different series of events. By the end of the book there are so many plots going on it gets old trying to follow which one is going on at the moment. So in summary if you want to read a book which has multiple plots too much symbolism and descriptions to put you to sleep then Lord of the Flies is for you. ",1.0

" I hated this book. All it is is an outlet for an author's deranged sybolism. The story is stupid and at the same time pointlessly graphic. If you want to read a good book read Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card. It is a very good book. Golding in a vain effort to make people understand his sideways point of view wrote a parody of 1940's British society. Who really gives a crud? I don't. All in all please please please don't read this horrible awful stupid pointless terrible book that is a great waste of time.

" My opinion of this book is that this book was horrible. The only time that it caught my eye was when they first got stuck on the island and when they got off. So basicallyin the middle of this book i wasn't listening. This book had alot of realism and creativity that was probably the highest point of this book. If I would have to pick a leader for them i wouldn't have picked any of them because they all act like animals. And the events that took place like for one when they thought that Simon was the beast that was just dumb to me. I also gave it one star because it didn't deserve anyting better than that.The friendship between Ralph and Piggy was odd. Another thing that was odd was these kids had the urge to kill one another. At the beginning of this book I asked myself'How did all these kids survive but not one adult did?' I think the book would have been a whole lot better if they had about 2 or 3 adults to keep the kids from talking about that ridiculous beast. The Lord Of The Flies I read for an sophmore english class. But the books that I read my freshman year like Of Mice and Men Romeo and Juliet and To Kill a Mockingbird those were good books and better books than Lord of The Flies. ",1.0

The book sickened me at certain parts. The descriptions were great but after reading an entire chapter and then some more descriptions it gets sort of boring. However i did like how Jack and Ralph TRIED to get along in the beggining you know BEFORE Jack went crazy. I also liked Goldings purpose of this book... how deep down we are savages.

" I really hated this book. I only read it because I was forced to read it in school. I think that the author is trying too hard to write a good book. There must have been a reason why this was out on the market for 5 years before anyone picked it up. The author tells you too much information in a short amount of time. He starts to talk about something and then just moves on to something else. He also leaves you hanging. He also uses way too many uncompleted sentences! Reading this book was a complete and total waste of my time!!!!!! ",1.0
" William Golding does not leave readers with any thinking space to ponder of the values he brought up in the book. Unlike Harper Lee whose novel requires a certain level of intelligence to interpret and understand this novel spits out the themes directly leaving no space for imagination. Even the symbols are so simple and uninteresting.This book has such a cynical and pessimistic view of the world that i totally disagree with.

" While I was reading this incredibly violent novel I could hardly bear to go on. I couldn't wait to finish it. Not because of the fabulousness of the book but because I couldn't wait to put the book down; it was so dumb. Unfortunately I was forced to finish the whole thing for English class. I'm glad the whole 'Lord of the Flies' topic is over. I've given several reviews on this book but since none of them came out I'm making one again---so I can tell everyone to be cautious and not to buy this book. No---that may be a little too harsh. I think this book is very uninteresting for most teens so I don't reccomend this book to be read by kids in the 16 and below age range. I suppose it's bearable---for someone who actually enjoys reading books like myself. But this would be utter hell for those who despise reading. The whole thing is just so wrong. Too many descriptions extremely wrong moral/point or whatever way too violent and I agree that W. Golding also failed to mention who was saying what sometimes as the reader from Houston said. I don't agree though that the ending was good. It's like there's this bunch of British boys stranded on a little island. Then they start getting all violent and drifting farther and farther away from their normal civilized selves. They form into two groups---the good group with Ralph and the bad group (also known as the tribe) with Jack---and fight over the silliest things. In the end two characters no longer exist---they've been killed by some of the boys. After all that senseless stuff all that happens is that a cruiser comes and rescues them and the whole nightmare is over. I mean stupid or what? ",1.0
" Until Lord of the Flies I had NEVER left a book unfinished. Flies was excruciatingly dull and uses way too much advanced vocabulary making it impossible to understand. The plot was horrible and the characters under developed. I had trouble keeping the characters straight. They just seemed to blend together and had no distinct personality. I pity anyone sucked into reading this. It was one of the worth things I have ever read and I absolutely despise it. I would just like to know what the heck Golding was thinking when he wrote this! If it was possible I would have given this book a negative ten. A one is much too high for such a poor excuse for literature. ",1.0

Now if I was 10 or 13 and such... I would not resort to killing people after like the second week. Then there is the fact of Ralph. Ralph is really arrogant of Piggy's feelings and eventually starts becoming annoying. Piggy is the only real character I liked next to Simon. Jack is really arrogant also. He is so immature that it is almost laughable. Didn't these kids come from a private school? My gosh to think that one week on an island could make some of the worst sins be committed by 10 year old boys....The whole detail of the story becomes a little to fine for its own good. The pictures the author describe have no meaning to me. Apparently there is a square pink piece of land jutting out of the beach. What? The whole end of chapter 3 was the worst when Simon walks through the forest. I just stopped caring about how that blade of grass was bent at a 76 degree angle.For those who want a great book try Tolkien or R.A. Salvatore.

When the the kettle is set down and the handle released the spout top closes. What a great idea!After just 6 months of light use the spout top will no longer close. I am so disappointed. FYI the whistle on it was great not too irritating but loud enough to get one's attention.I am on the hunt for a new teakettle. A stainless one with a non-irritating whistle --- some of these teakettles sound like a tornado siren. ",1.0
" This is the cheapest lamest toy I have ever purchased. The decals are small torn put on shoddily. The plastic is very cheap and poorly put together. It cannot stand one play session without breaking apart even if your child is not rough on toys. You would be better off shopping at the 99 cent store than purchasing this product.

" I recently saw this movie at a friend's house and it was quite good... for a great many laughs. I usually love post-Apocalyptic movies like the Mad Max series. The difference is that the Mad Max trilogy does a much better job of mixing modern and ancient and futuristic set pieces scenery and props. Beowulf just screwed it all up on so many levels. The outpost has a PA system and zippered-plastic body bags but no electricity. Some of the people are dressed in armour then you have the girl running around in Doc Martens and torn red thigh highs. My favourite was the porn-queen crimped hair succubus with way too much blue eyeshadow. She belonged in a Motley Crue video. Grendel was the least scary thing in the whole movie.I really loved the oversized Barber's razour 'chopper' thing at the beginning. At least the person being executed gets a last laugh when they see that ridiculous thing.Now for me to vent about how thoroughly they screwed up the storyline. Hrothgar was not (NOT!!) Grendel's father. Beowulf was not born 'half of Heaven and half of Hell' whatever that sounds so stupid. He was a Danish king no more no less. Lastly he killed Grendel's mother in a lake and did not run off with Hrothgar's daughter.I did have lots of fun ripping this movie apart while watching it so it does have it's good points. ",1.0

" I was the only one in my senior English class who loved the epic poem. Several years later I bought a copy of it at a comic book shop.For some reason I liked Christopher Lambert and I thought he would be a good actor for a movie based on this classic tale.Man was I wrong!Aside from the names of the hero and one of the villians this movie has almost nothing in common with the poem. It's got nothing in common with a good movie. It's a travesty!The acting even with a so-called 'top talent' like Christopher Lambert is awful. The setting is almost non-existant and the plot ah yes the plot ....I knew this movie would reek within the first 10 minutes. I mean I tried really hard to be open-minded but it was to no avail.Spare yourself the pain and skip the movie. Settle in on a dark winter's night by a fire put on some quiet music and read the epic poem. You'll be glad you did. ",1.0
" I agree with the reviewer who said 'Read the book.' Or better yet see Thirteenth Warrior which is another fanciful rendition of this myth.Yeah it's a B movie. It even has glimmers of interesting character development and plot line in it. But it's also-as one reviewer recognized--a pseudo video game an imitation of an imitation of a life. It's a hostile cretin pubescent violence fantasy festering in a cracked mirror. Beowulf in the original tale saved people from the monsters and nobly sacrificed himself. In this moronic film he is a sociopathic 'swiss-army-knife' who wants us to feel sorry for him. BEOWULF the film is gratuitous violence run amok. Who is the real monster in this film? Who really cares if the main character gets et? Everybody not just mostly everybody should have died in this film. They were all despicable. ",1.0
" This is a pretty bad movie. It was only 90+ minutes and it seemed like forever. The sets are pretty good and some of the action scenes are as well. That is about all that is good. The special effects are bad...laughingly so at the end. There is no character development and most of the actors don't even bother to act (such as the king). There isn't much plot except near the end. You spend the whole movie wondering when the actual story will begin. It canabalizes the Beowulf legend to the point where the only thing in common is some monster killing everyone. And while they claim it is a 'technofuture' its really just a medieval setting with some props forced in (like a loudspeaker in a stone castle). You'd be much better off watching The 13th Warrior.

" This is worse than a B movie. When my fiancee and I rented it we weren't sure what to expect but we figured since it has Christopher Lambert it couldn't be all that bad. We were wrong.There isn't much to this movie other than bad techno music a porn star and a bunch of technology that didn't fit anywhere in history except the late 19th century. The only thing the movie appears to share with the epic Beowulf is the name and a faint storyline of a half mortal half god being coming to destroy a creature that's wrecking havoc on a castle.I love Christopher Lambert but this movie did not do justice to his acting skills. He doesn't have any lines that are worth remembering the movie doesn't do much to develop his character and for being half human half god he's surprisingly vulnerable. There's a short (five minutes or less) amount of time given to why he's half human half god and why he's there to defeat the Grendal.The rest of the characters are pretty flat even Kyra (Rhona Mitra) and Grendal's Mother (Layla Roberts). There isn't anything special about either of the them and the only thing Layla Roberts brings to the film are a few dream sequences where she gets to act sexy and porn star like and Rhona Mitra really doesn't add anything.Beowulf really turned out to be a pretty one-dimensional movie with a lot of bad techno that really didn't fit. Add in one porn star some technology that's centuries before it's time lots of people who haven't been in a lot of well known movies and some sword fighting and you have a step below B grade movie.

" Ok where to start with this piece of junk. Christopher Lambert sleep-walks through his scenes and the other actors take their queue from him. The soundtrack his pure heavy metal with no real link to the scenes. The set is minimalist to say the least - pipes and natural gas flames do not make a set. Writing was atrocious directing was even worse if that is possible.This movie is just one more reason that Hollywood should not be allowed to touch a classic written story. Read the classic Anglo-Saxon story but don't get this movie. Avoid at all cost. ",1.0
" I'm convinced that this is the worst movie ever made. I rented it because it sounded like it might have been remotely interesting but it wasn't even that.

Take the money you were going to spend on the tape buy a torch and a metal hanger heat the hanger with the torch and beat yourself senseless. It would be infinately more enjoyable than watching this movie. ",1.0
" Unbelievably stupid and inane. Chris Lambert has the acting ability of a limp dish rag. If you haven't seen a pseudo-martial arts film that spends most of its time having the actors sommersault backwards again and again and again and again to a soundtrack filled with WHOOSH! WHOOSH! WHOOSH! WHOOSH! then this film is for you. And the fact that this film is based on what is considered the first English language literary classic is sacrilegious. Everyone associated with this film should be subjected to that huge single-edged razor blade used to separate people shown in the beginning of the film. This goes down in my books as one of the biggest bombs of all time. And Chris Lambert is positively laughable as an actor. Bar this man from acting!! Trash this film or--better--use it to prep people in how NOT to make a film. ",1.0
" I rented this film knowing it would have nothing to do with Beowulf the book. In fact I rented it expecting very little except for maybe a couple good action scenes and some Rhona Mitra cheesecake. There's one passable action scene in the first few minutes and Rhona Mitra is appealing in her low-cut leather bodice but she doesn't really do anything in the movie and frankly neither does anyone else. This movie is ten minutes of excitement jam-packed into two hours. It's not really 'funny bad' in a B-movie way and it's not really interesting on any other level. The biggest laugh you will get out of this flick is the 'Mortal Kombat' rip-off opening credits. If you're looking for a cheesy B-movie to watch re-rent an old favorite and don't waste your time with this one. ",1.0
" Wow. I really didn't know they made movies this bad. While Lambert has been known to star in a few clunkers this one has to take the cake. The script is just the pits the soundtrack is an incessant techno-type music that seems out of place the setting is terribly unconvincing and the actors (to the extent that they can act) are worse than just about anything I've ever seen.Avoid this film unless you are a connoisseur of bad movies.

" Having read Beowulf as a high schooler I wondered if anyone could do justice to the epic poem. Unfortunately we will have to wait. I evaluating the dvd I wish I could come up with something artist or journalistic to say about it in order to sound like a movie critic but all I can think of is 'the movie is terrible.' Lambert's flat unemotional performance leaves even the best of fans (I loved the Highlander) cold. The highlight of the film has is the fight exchanges and even then the feats fall flat. In a day when the Matrix and Jet Li (Romeo Must Die) have taken fight scenes to the next level employing the latest and greatest computer aided and stunt techniques Beowulf takes us back to the dark ages of cinematography. My recommendation",1.0
" This movie was in short terrible. The storyline was filled with holes and didn't even come close to following the original epic written so long ago.The actors almost seemed to be ashamed of themselves for taking part in this F-movie production. Simply because Christopher Lambert can wield a sword doesn't make him right for the part of a warrior as great as Beowulf was meant to be. Rhona Mitra was a waste of a character. As was Gotz Otto. Out of all the characters that were written in the epic poem only two of the original names were used. The rest were changed or omited unnecessarily.The creature they came up with for Grendel was cheap and even silly to say the least. The rest of the special effects were second rate as were the actors.The end scene with Grendel's mother was drawn out and sad.If you want to see a movie that has absolutely nothing to do with the great epic of Beowulf then buy otherwise save your money for something better. ",1.0
" After reading Beowulf I was curious how this great epic could be translated into other genres. Part of what makes the poem great is its language. It's chant-like use of alliteration caesura and compound wording makes it beautifully nuanced reading. Moreover the story itself has all the essential parts and themes to keep the reader intrigued. The film adaptation however had none of this.I was very disappointed to find that besides ignoring all of the above the movie created such ludicrous plot twists as a weakly contrived love interest and far fetched psychological melodrama. To treat this fundamentally christian-pagan poem this way is near sacrilige. ",1.0

" Have you ever read a book on a subject with which you have some expertise and wonder if the writer is just making things up as he goes along? This was nearly the experience in reading this book by Duncan Lindsey a UCLA professor.The first problem is that Lindsey takes the shotgun approach to arguing his points against the existing child protective services system. Instead of centering his arguments on a few specific issues and developing his thesis he tries to address every conceivable aspect of the child welfare system and liberally scatters his thoughts and comments without a strong basis of analysis. The result is a loose confederation of ideas none of which with a firm foundation for acceptance.The second problem is that Lindsey attempts to address issues for which he does not seem to have actual knowledge. His attack on the legal basis of the child protective system for being a civil model rather than a criminal model is amateurish (at best). His understanding of the social workers management of the case lacks first hand understanding of the field. I wanted to give some examples to explain my points but it would result in a much longer review than what I prefer. It must suffice to say that I believe the professor's expertise is apparently more academic and esoteric than real life.A third problem is Lindsey's contradicting himself in various parts of his book. For example he spends time discussing how children's deaths is increasing but in another chapter argues that death is but a small area of concern for protecting children. He titles this later chapter as 'Child abuse the red herring of child welfare.' Therefore he argues that the current system is not doing enough to protect children from destructive parents but argues that too much of the same system focuses on a problem that is a small issue in child welfare. So which is it?It is unfortunate that the author did not sacrifice a couple of hundred pages and written a monograph on one of his points. Then he could have provided a document worth quoting and considering. Instead we have a lengthy diatribe absent developed charges worth remembering. ",1.0
" I have been interested in the ethical issues surrounding animals in society for some time but have only recently taken the step of becoming actively involved in the welfare of animals.

The 'ideal' that seems to be sought is certainly well-detailed but to me it seemed to be so far away from what is 'practical' that I finally gave up. I guess I'm more interested in getting my hands dirty and really doing something to lessen the suffering of animals than just thinking about doing so and constructing convoluted philosophies that will never be implemented.

" I paid good money for this CD online. The front cover of the CD says that it's a Parental Advisory CD  but it's not. The title track 'Daddy's Little Girl' is edited all over the place. This song is the reason why I purchased it & spent almost 11 bucks plus shipping & handling costs for it. I am greatly disappointed that Def Jam or Nikki D thinks that this album should be deserving of a Parental Advisory sticker if they're not going to stay true to the music & live up to it's Parental Advisory sticker warning label as intended. I'm not saying I enjoy listening to cuss words in music  but cuss words really are better than listening to the annoying beeping sounds & rewind sounds that this album contains. Again  beeping sounds are worse on the ears than cuss words. They are equally if not more annoying than the bad words. I believe in my 1st Amendment Rights & we as America are losing this right slowly  but surely if the government has it's way with us one of these days. We will soon have no right to Freedom Of Speech even through the means of adult content oriented Parental Advisory CD's that I am well aware of & am prepared for any & all curse words contained in an album I specifically buy & listen to. When there is a Parental Advisory sticker on an album & it's as extremely edited as tis one is  it makes me hesitate about buying any & all future albums that promise one thing but sell the opposite. If you don't mind edited music when the album says Parental Advisory on the front  then buy this album. But  if you want what you pay for  then you shouldn't. The producers & creators & musicians of this album lied when they stated it's a Parental Advisory album. It is not. It's an edited one. I would have been more happier if the Parental Advisory sticker was never introduced to this album & I would have had myself to blame when coming across all the edited music that was contained in it if I ever had false thoughts & reservations that this album contained explicit lyrics.

" Along with Duiker Marr is one ingorrant of history in Vietnam in its people. Ho Chi Minh was a thief murderer and cruel dictator as the world has seen in Hitler Lenin Stalin Pol Pot and many others of the 20th century.Ho Chi Minh was never a nationalist he worried about his own persona and legacy to Vietnam as much as the dictators of the world worried about their image. He was a communist because no regular government would have listened to his crazy mind using it as a mean to his end. Just like Hitler he was nothing until some desperates listened to his so called charisma. When he lead the Communists in Vietnam he was a much as fault for the 3 millions killed during the war. He himself ordered executions of countless civilians as they refused to follow him. He forced thousands of Vietnamese to labor and camps in the North. From the North through the South of Vietnam people were scared of the Communists that's why the exodus of millions to the South in 1954 when the country was divided. And again in 1975 millions more left the country because the communists took over the rest of the country.Do you really think the Vietnamese wanted Ho to lead the country? Would they submit themselves to tyranny and death camps so they can enjoy the lives of a communist? No! They fled everywhere Communists appear. Because in the Communists' eyes anyone who is educated was a traitor anyone who had different ideas than theirs anyone who had religion land some kind of assets some kind of beliefs who hold traditional values was a traitor to their cause and therefore they must be dealt with with torture and death to the whole family as an example for others. Please refer to the movie 'Killing Fields' as an illustration of what was going on with Cambodie and Vietnam. It was never on the media because journalists were never allowed on the other side of the fence weren't they? The only thing you could see is just what Americans and the South Vietnamese were oppressing to the poor farmers. And how Jane Fonda made herslef useful to the NVA.So please explain to me where Ho was a nationalist and a liberator?Thirty years after the fall of Saigon Vietnam still struggles with poverty corruption and Communism where the rest of the world around Vietnam has taken off. Thanks to Ho and his communists all the intellectuals of the country are either in jail or fled out of the country and 95% out of the 80M Vietnamese is in poverty and earn less than $500 per year. And you can vote and have some kind of freedon only if you were to join the Communist Party.

" The plot is original and refreshing but the story is written in a bland Disney way. The author tries to put in twists and turns in the plot but it was all very predictable.

" I picked this book up for my son age 7 who likes cats. I was thinking that we could read it together. I started reading the book on my own to see what it was like. This book is NOT for young children. I don't want to have to explain to my son what at 'Cutter' is and why cat's would be afraid of it. I don't think that young children should be hearing about the pleasure that cats (or any animals) get from a fresh kill. Those just aren't the types of things I want to introduce to him at his age. This book should really be targetted for older children (teenagers) not young readers. Besides the issue of the target audience I do feel the writer does capture the feelings of cats as best as a human can capture an animals 'feelings' but I also think that the writing is not particularly polished or engaging. I would not recommend this book. ",1.0

" Warriors seemed to be very popular and it got five stars so I bought it for my Kindle. I was disapointed though when I found that the book was simply about cats mauling each other to death. I was hardly able to finish the book and I will not be able to continue the series ",1.0
" With the Warriors fanbase growing larger and larger I figured I'd give the first book a try. I wanted to like it but something about it just didn't hit the mark for me.First of all the characters blatantly annoyed me. The main character Firepaw was particuarly grating. I'm not sure if you're familiar with the title 'Gary-Stu' but it means a character who is beyond flaw who is handsome quick-witted and rarely gets in trouble for breaking the rules. These are a few qualities I noticed in Firepaw that made him truly unlikeable for me. The scene where he bravely attacks the cat taunting him for his 'kittypet' background and rips off his collar was enough to make me actually giggle.Another complaint I have about the characters is that they seemed like cardboard cut outs with the same stilted way of talking ('Look young apprentice. A sprout. Newleaf will be here in but a moon and then freshkill will be running well again.' not a direct quote but you get the idea) and not much personality except for the idea that they have a name and some color of 'pelt'.The plot left much to be desired too. The author was killing off characters faster than she could introduce them! Shortly after Firepaw is accepted into Thunderclan we learn that Greypaw's mentor Redtail has been killed in a battle. Overload of information? We barely know who Grewpaw is let alone his mentor. We can't really be expected to mourn over his death can we after just learning his name. I found that for most of the book knowledge was being shoved down my throat quicker than I could digest it. Thank goodness for the handy character key in the beginning of the book or I might not be able to keep those swarms of characters straight in my head! (I hope you note the sarcasm.) This is where the lack of distinct personalities really comes into play",1.0

" It was hard to believe I was reading Hemingway - but then again not really. His style of rambling sentences and thoughts was there. But he jumped around a lot. And the subject matter (an insider view of bullfighting) was despicable. Most of the book was spent trying to demonstrate that one was close-minded if one did not appreciate the art of the bullfight instead of getting hung up on the petty issue of the goring of the horses and the killing of the bulls. It was the first book in as long as I can remember that I did not finish. I kept saying it had to get better since this was Hemingway. Instead it kept getting worse. ",1.0
" I read this book for the literary circle at my high school and we unanimously declared it the worst thing we had ever read. It had no structure so it appeared to be a mixed-up jumble of thoughts. Since there was no structure the author strays off the 'topic' (supposedly bullfights) quite frequently into little discussions about 'venereal diseases' which he claims are relevant as they are a cause of death to many bullfighters.Perhaps if you have a Spanish background or love bullfighting or possibly Ernest Hemmingway it is possible you could relate to this book and enjoy it.Please note that our lit. circle read other books by Ernest Hemmingway. Those books including 'A Farewell to Arms' 'The Old Man and the Sea' and 'The Sun Also Rises' are definitely worth the read.

" Like the reviewer socrates 17 I am waiting for ABC/Stephen King to credit Lars von Trier as the source of this new mini-series. Unfortunately judging from the promotions for the series (which include this book published by an arm of ABC network) it doesn't seem that they will. Instead they seem to be trying to pass this book off as the truth when in fact there isn't even a Kingdom Hospital in Maine - (CMCC hospital is the one utilized in this series). Yes this story is simply the thinly (VERY thinly) changed story of Riget (i.e. the Kingdom) and Riget II brilliantly written and directed by Lars von Trier in 1994 and 1997 respectively. When I contacted Zentropa studios with my concern they said that the rights to Riget and Riget II had been sold to the television series but not the accreditation. They too are obviously waiting for ABC to make the proper acknowledgement.Given this I would pass on the book and instead see the wonderful von Trier originals. As socrates 17 saysit is possible to find Riget in PAL format from Amazon UK although in my case I was lucky enough to find it in a now defunct video store in NTSC format. Riget II is occasionally shown on tv - IFC showed it about a year ago and one of the pay channels (STARZ I think) showed it this past fall. Definately check these von Trier films out; they are uniquely plotted wonderfully shot and acted and I still have the images of Udo Kier (as the monstrous baby) in my mind. ",1.0

It is pretty far off in its depiction of the paranormal beginning with the ants. If this is King's work he has succeeded at seeming to be a complete amateur.

" I am quite upset with the reviewer who says no one in this country has heard of Lars Von Trier. Many people have. Bjork has even been in one of his movies gimme a break! This book seems just a fictional tie in to Stephen King's series and the money used to buy it would be better seen going to buy the original Kingdom by Von Trier. I am currently watching King's version but I hope none of his viewers think this was totally his idea or that it is real. I am not saying one Kingdom is better than the other I only wish viewers to educate themselves by watching Von Trier's version too and not making such sweeping judgements that Americans are too stupid to read subtitles or enjoy a TV series from another country!Having said this I am sure King's fans will enjoy it if it is read as a fiction. Maybe some of Lars Von Trier fans will like it too. I just higly recommend seeing both and then deciding which you like more. And yes Kingdom 2 aired a few months ago on IFC so it is accessible...you can also get a copy of Kingdom 1 on VHS. ",1.0

" First off its in Japanese and didn't come with subtitles (at least for kindle) . Girls get attacked by evil ninjas women who spend most of the movie beating and choking the heroes.

I suppose that getting punched and kicked for 5-10 minutes and not being hurt is easily possible since it hardly ever looked like any of the blows made contact.This movie has no nudity sexuality or real plot.

" This book is garbage plain and simple. William Still takes the unusual tactic of investigating secret society activity through a fundamental Christian perspective. This could have led to interesting results but this book comes nowhere close. I am not trying to criticize Still's beliefs but he clearly comes from the religious tradition that believes that any sort of behavior that does not agree with his theology 100% is 'satanist'. In fact he condemns his subject matter as 'satanist' or 'satanism' so many times that the judgement loses its force very quickly. Still also comes from the branch of Christianity that feels that all persons or ideas that do not comply with those fundamental beliefs to the letter are part of a vast conspiracy seeking to crush Christian beliefs. Once again Still's personal beliefs are his right but he has such a clear contempt for his subject matter that he is completely unable to investigate it in any useful fashion. Just when he is on the verge of unveiling useful information about the actions of secret societies each time he collapses into tired religious dogma.This book is not the 'investigative' journalism that Still tries to tell you it is. I'll give him a little credit for trying but he fails. He is completely unable to see around his personal hatred and contempt for his subject.... ",1.0

" This is yet another example of an excellent musical play made into a horrible movie. The original play was purposefully set in unrealistic situations but at the same time the music was of excellent quality. The movie has taken the play and turned it into a comedy that is not funny. The music has become farce. Beautiful semi-classical style music from the play has been dumbed down into cheap rock junk. The singers exaggerate emotions so much that it borders on ridiculousness. Nowhere is this more present than in the narrator's horrible exaggerated singing style. The only bright spot in this movie is Donny Osmond's singing quality.

" I am one of the few people apparently who disliked this video intensely. I remember watching a pre-Donny Osmond staging of it at a small college theater and fell in love. I bought the CD of the original production by Andrew Lloyd Weber/Time Rice and listened until I had the songs memorized. Years later I saw the Donny Osmond version and thought he did a good job of producing it. His voice was good and so were those of the other performers. The singers playing Joseph's brothers were the highlight of the experience. They were brilliant. However I was disappointed that they changed the narrator from an alto to a soprano. I also didn't like some of the constumes though I was admittedly up in the nosebleed section of his production and couldn't see the detail. The Elvis Pharoh's number was WAY overdone in the Donny Osmond's stage production.I bought this video tape to support a local theater production and figured that owning a Donny Osmond version would be better than living without one. I was wrong. The singers playing the brothers were still brilliant but that is the only good thing I can say about it. I did not like the camera work of the movie at all. I didn't like the opening and closing scenes they added feeling that it didn't add any production value. I hated most of the costumes involving Potiphar's wife and the cheerleaders in the 'Go Go Go Joseph' song. The Pharoh's scene was even more hammy than the stage production to the point of being unpalatable and most of the costumes were inappropriate. It was quite frankly a raunchy production and had my kids asking questions that needed to wait until they were older to explain. Disgusted I threw my copy out after the first viewing. ",1.0

" Having seen only Episode 1 it is certainly well-intentioned and is respectful of its subjects both in Kenya and Tanzania. But two ongoing themes of the program are a) the age-old importance of land and b) the timelessness of the African people.Concerning a) this is for the most part a fundamental misreading of African peoples across the continent reflecting a Eurocentric concern with land as opposed to a concern with people. While land has long been a scarce resource in Europe owing to centuries of overpopulation and a feudal system that equated land with wealth the African continent was until the nineteenth century relatively underpopulated. Land was plentiful. What was important was that which was scarce",1.0
" Why not use the names in the common scripture that we are all familiar with . . Noah Shem Ham and Canaan. In particular rather than use the name of Canaan who was cursed by Noah (implying that all Canaanites were cursed) another name was used. Whether this odd assortment of names (going back to a previous scriptural translation) was done to be cute or if there was a more sinister reason it was at the least an annoyance.Another issue that I found disturbing was the painting of Noah as a tyrant to his family. He may have had reverence for the Almighty but he was shown to be a mean fellow particularly to his wife. The reason that he and his family were chosen above all others to be survivor of the deluge was not made clear. Noah may not have had a sexual appetite for other women contrary to others in the story who did but was that reason enough for him to survive?In Scripture there is no mention of any authority given to Noah to invite others to go with him. He is clearly commanded to take only his wife and children and their wives. But he tells others that if they would have a good heart they would be allowed to come with him. This is another flaw and a serious one I believe. Why did Noah assume the sin of pride in showing others that he had the power to bring them along even if no one took him up on it?This was a poorly thought-out story. It is a fairy tale within a fairy tale and it just didn't work for me. The facts are not all correct and the underlying impetus for the entire episode of the flood is not shown clearly. I tend to think that the reasons for writing such a book changing the names particularly not acknowledging Canaan and Canaanites as the cursed of Scripture is more a promotion of a revisionist way of treating the subject and of treating the Old Testament than an interesting take on legend. Sunday schools should concentrate on readings from Scripture until something comes along that makes more sense and that is more honest than this attempt. ",1.0

" So I'm at the video store the other day and the manager tells me this new movie that was banned in Germany just came in and that it was supposed to be uberly kewl and I needed to check it out. Didn't look like my kind of flick but I figured I'd give it a look.Wow.I have seen a lot of REALLY bad movies over the years but this is truly in a class of its own. To call it a 'film' would be inaccurate. There is no plot. It seems to have been shot in a single take on a VHS camera using recycled tapes as I've seen far better resolution from cheapo camera phones. The 'blood' isn't even red -- it looks like coffee either being splashed from a cup or squirted out of a tube. The 'intestines' hanging out of an abdomenal wound appear to be constructed from blue sweatpants. The makeup f/x seem to have been handled by autistic jr high students with ADD . . . either that or they just didn't care. Oh and the story sucked too. Some nonsense about 'Your uncle was killed by a drunk driver and if you join our gang we'll kill the drunk's whole family for you.'I struggled to endure this 'film' until about 5 minutes into the first fight where the fellow who just received serious gunshot wounds through both thighs proceeded to chase the shooter around and kick him -- then the gun was taken away and he shot the shooter -- whereupon the shooter pops open the hatchback of his car and pulls out a small chainsaw (already running) to counterattack -- and his victim then proceeds to grasp the bar of said chainsaw (as well as the sharp spinning chain) with both hands sustaining not so much as a papercut . . . after watching a few more minutes of this stupidity I realized that I couldn't even fast forward through the remaining 90% of the 'film' so I instead pressed the 'chapter advance' button repeatedly and saw that it was pretty much the same throughout.To add insult to injury the perpetrator of this cinematic dog dropping actually had the audacity to add 'Special Features' to the disc in which he pontificates about his vision and philosophy . . . for which he should be beaten with a large stick . . . even though there were no subtitles for the Special Features and I can't understand German. I see this 'film' was released in 1999 and I wonder at which fast food franchise the Writer/Director now toils?This is the Worst Movie Ever Made. And it isn't even funny.

He is obviously completely ignorant of the Qu'ran which he never quotes but that doesn't stop him from making the most outrageous statements about Persian culture and claiming that 'The Koran [sic] tells them to do it.' He claims that the peoples' inherent fatalism prevents them from seeking remedies against disease as that disease is supposed to be due to the will of God then in the very next paragraph he goes on about how ignorant and ineffectual the remedies of the local doctors are!Such bald-faced duplicity is due to the massive axe Adams has to grind.

The characters were all stereotypes with no real development to make them real. Tom Selleck's character lacked all the touches that made his other characters special. The plot was typical cowboy cliches. The soundtrack was loud extremely dated and annoying.I could sit and watch all eight hours of Lonesome Dove at one time or a dozen hours of Deadwood.

" The bible practices animal sacrifice and it's inherently anti-compassion anti-animal rights anti-women's rights. The very name of this book is anti-compassion anti-respect. Dominion. To dominate someone or to have dominion over them is an act of violence. Usually the vicious fight for dominance not gentle powerful guardians. To try to dominate someone is to try to use aggressive force to control them. Guardian is a very powerful word the word includes respect for animals and uses gentle as possible methods to protect them and consider their needs and desires as we would any creature we have power over - like our own children. Always the powerful should respect those they have power over because it's just luck that you have it - and you should grieve for those that don't have it and try to give your power to others. All good to all beings. Dominance is the abuse of power. The men who love the bible like to dominate women also and they would have us connect our sexual desires only to the endless dichotomy of dominion and submission of dogs versus the goodness and equality of love.I think the bible is the most cruel and stupid book ever written. It's the philosophy of one hand clapping the philosophy of Nothing - slavery is freedom cruelty and chlid/animal sacrifice is love love is gentle and kind but oh no love is actually your children being tortured to death in horrific sacrifices to the demands a 'god' who is uh... likely a predator bio-tech jerk. Wake up. Phelps is probably really akin to Fred Phelps and this crap is probably paid for by the pyramid scheme of predation - the new trend is to write books about love and hide things about male or white supremacy in them torture and abuse horrible cruelty of all kinds write a book about animal rights and slither in some anti-animal rights propaganda etc... I'm pretty sure this author is enemy propaganda and is attempting to ease you in that direction. Avoid Christianity Pagan religions that ease you into animal abuse and all religion that practices male supremacy white supremacy animal torture or child torture and sacrifice - real animals and children suffer in these religions. There have been many children genuinely sacrificed and 'martyred' in Christianity just so some male supremacist jerks can secure more power for their greedy selves. It's not enough you've been given greater size and physical strength in general but also must control all governments religions family life - everything. Back off and learn some generosity. Voodoo also genuinely harms animals as well as tribal religions that practice animal sacrifice hunting rituals etc...I think religion can be an act of aggression - and many religions are in fact just traps that are very cruel. I'd love to see a religion some day that genuinely opposes the suppression and slavery of women child abuse animal abuse and the worship of the creators of this bio-tech pyramid scheme of predation. I do not believe that the people who created this world are in any way good. The snake and the tree of knowledge is meant to scare you from the truth about the knowledge of good and evil for were you to discover it you would discover that the creators are PREDATORS WHO CREATE PREDATORS and are no different from any other child rapists slave owners and cruel tyrants - they are evil.

I don't have much use for a DVD player advertised to play PAL as well as NTSC that will not play region 2 DVDs.

It does upconvert to 1080P through the HDMI cable. I have a 40 inch LCD it it is impossible for me to detect any upgrade of picture quality from this player set to 1080P and another player that plays at 1080I.

" I purchased this Pioneer DV-400V-K to get higher resolution from my old DVD's on a new Sony KDL-40V2500 1080P widescreen. The Pioneer can be set to 480I or P 720P 1080I or P but the highest resolution I can get it to play in is 480P. If I set it on anything higher the picture goes black after 20-30 seconds.After careful comparison for image quality (I also have my old Sony DVD player hooked up so comparison is easily done)there is a slight improvement in 480P over 480I but it is subtle. I was disapointed that I was not able to get a higher resolution. I was assured by the salesman and reviews I read that I would get close to high res out of my regular 480I dvd's on this player. This did not happen. I am interested in hearing from any other buyers that have had this problem and if anything can be done about it short of returning it and trying another brand.I would consider getting a HD DVD player or Blu-ray which also claim to upconvert older DVD's but I am reluctant to believe them after this Pioneer upconverter experience.

I feel like I've been misled because this doesn't cover all of what is in the other book and reference to it is made within this smaller version but no reference was made to the fact that this is a smaller version of the whole in the ordering/buying process.While some of the recipes are good they aren't better than what can be found elsewhere -- and the whole concept of 'wheat meat' grosses me out. Why not just go vegetarian? To do this program you need to either be in a rural situation (urban neighbors don't appreciate beehives and chickens) or on a very large suburban lot.

" Having been a long time fan like so many other enya listeners this latest album proved to me that Enya has lost the 'spark' that made her the new age star that she is. I agree with all the other reviewers when they say that this album along with 'A day without Rain' are merely rehashed versions of her older albums. In my opinion The Memory of Trees was her last great and original album that blew me away. Orinocco Flow Shepard Moons the Celts and Memory of Trees all had its own uniqueness and took listeners to a brand new world of Enya each time it was released. Songs like Book of Days Memory of Trees Orinocco Flow Alderbaran were some of the examples of Enya's masterpieces. Unfortunately when 'A Day without Rain' came out I was disappointed to hear the same type of beat that Memory of Trees had used repeated in that new album. Unlike her other albums i quickly put 'A Day without Rain' to rest and hoped for Enya to inspire us once again in her future album. Now that Amarantine is out it has made me a very sad fan to see that Enya and her team has really lost the magic and are simply using the same tones to make new songs. I for one still remain an Enya fan despite the fact. If you are a die hard enya fan and A day without Rain didn't bother you then maybe you will enjoy this album. But if you agree with my above statement about her previous album you'll probably wanted to spent the money elsewhere like Moya Brennan Enya's sister's new album is a nice refreshing sound. ",1.0

" After a five-year interval Enya disappoints with her weakest album to date. I have been a devoted admirer of the Irish singer since 'Orinoco Flow' first hit the airwaves years ago and have eagerly awaited each and every offering including her singles which oftentimes contain extra bonus tracks that turn out to be mini-masterpieces. I understand how many critics brush her aside claiming that her music is too artificial too cold too computer generated to stir genuine emotions and with those criticisms I strongly disagree until now. True you buy an Enya album because it sounds like an Enya album. No matter how many years go by in between songs are frequently interchangeable from one CD to the next and that's okay. Enya's strength lies in the perfect blending of her unique voice and her music and the magic that she creates with them in the studio-intricate spider's webs of fragile melodies and haunting refrains.But the magic is absent from 'Amarantine'.The entirety of the album's brief 45 minute running time is to put it simply exceedingly dull. Instead of spirited otherworldly evocative songs this album flows by lugubriously and depressingly. The songs are pallid and barely stick in the brain. Only the title track-a word whose definition along with being a vibrant shade of red means to be everlastingly youthful or beautiful-has sparks of that once Enya allure. Even the lone instrumental piece 'Drifting' is ponderous and pales in the light of other such previous wordless tracks as 'A Day Without Rain' 'Tea House Moon' or 'Watermark'.Enya's 'sound' is also different. True there's nothing wrong with expanding or growing as an artist but as the old saying goes",1.0
" Look I like Enya...I really do. I have all of her CDs and play them a lot but come on folks this CD is nothing but lukewarm leftovers. There's not a single 'classic' Enya track. The songs are too slow and too depressing. What did somebody close to her die during the five years it took to put this way-too-short offering out? I don't want to hear Enya singing about gloom and doom. Sure some of her other songs are 'sad' but not like this! This album's not varied at all except for that silly 'Riverdance' ditty in some fictious language created by Roma Ryan. Ms. Ryan's lyrics are often terribly juvenile...does she sleep with a rhyming dictionary next to her bed? All that's missing is moon spoon and June not to mention the fact that a lot of lines are grammatically incorrect and some don't even scan correctly when sung or that there is no such word as 'amarantine'!! Where's that old Enya magic? Is this Enya evolving into the 'new' Enya? And if this is the 'new' Enya this is a step backward. This one's sub-par no matter what the 'real' Enya fans say...and ya know what? If you really are a REAL Enya fan you know that this one's not great...we were all just starving after half a decade of waiting looking forward to another masterpiece like 'Book of Days' 'Only Time' or 'Caribbean Blue' and Enya threw us an old soup bone. I hope that Father Christmas leaves a huge lump of coal in Enya's stocking this year in payback for this lump of cold Irish stew. ",1.0
" I have been a long-time admirer of Enya's gorgeous work for many years. Her celestial melodies unique arrangements and singular voice have provided me with hours of listening pleasure for more than a decade. But as the years and her albums have come and gone there is one glaring truth about Enya's work that has become ever more apparent--that her growth as an artist has been disturbingly minimal at best. Of course this is not to say that her recordings have not progressed in any way. Her otherwordly sound and image have become ever more slick. But such advancement is growth on a lateral level at most--one must assume this being the result of an effort to secure her worldwide legion of fans with a predictable output one that will guarantee her placment as #1 on the New Age charts for years at a time. Even so each of Enya's previous albums have offered more than a few memorable tracks that remain enjoyable after years of playing. So 'Amarantine' is a terrible disappointment in its almost total lack of anything worthwhile save for what amounts to less than a handful of at best mediocre pieces. And so lacklustre not to mention brief is the album overall that it borders on insult to fans who have waited more than five years since her last major release. So routine are the songs on 'Amarantine' as to resemble nothing more than alternate versions of previously released tracks--these being the ones that were wisely dropped. But in the end none of these criticisms will really matter much to Enya's cult who will embrace this album with stars in their eyes and a total lack of discrimination in their ears. I must admit if I found a way to make enough millions to afford me a splendid life in a spectacular castle as Enya has through her music machine I too would churn out such unchallenging dreck as this latest release as well. But I would hope not have the audacity to call myself a musical artist. Perhaps 'sausage-maker tunesmith' has more of a ring of truth to it. Congratulations Enya keep smiling that vacant and knowing smile. You've fooled almost everyone. ",1.0

" I just heard about this cd last night and I was very interested in hearing the clips. Once I did I realized how important it is to cover Rage and have a guitar player who can figure out the sounds and a singer that sounds like Zack. The singer on those clips had no energy and didn't sound like Zack at all. That ruined it for me because the music actually sounded really close to the real thing. I don't understand why they'd have a tribute cd and try to sound exactly like the band when we can just go buy the albums of the real band. ",1.0
" There were no ideas that were not developed by the 1960's in this book. There were a lot of stereotypical 'war stories' of stuttering. The old mantra of self-esteem which is being proven scientifically false over and over is trotted out and delved into at length. Additionally a lot of work is spent on relaxation technigues coupled with manipulating the way you think about things (called framing in the book). Basically the author encourages one to 'get over it'. There are some slick new acronyms such as PWS (the person who stutters!!!) but come on...no advancement.I'd encourage interested readers to check out the Valsalva techniques found in other books such as by William Parry.

" There is a crying need for new histories of the Cold War based on revelations especially from Soviet sources but also from declassified American material released since the end of the period. This is not it. Covering the 40+ years in less than 300 pages implies some superficiality but Gaddis' approach makes the effort essentially worthless. He also has to take the obligatory slap at McCarthy without bothering to admit that 'we now know' (the title of another Gaddis work) that declassified material has largely shown that he told the truth and his detractors consistently lied. He then digresses into a ludricrous analysis of nuclear strategy that coincides with no known theory. He has dumbed the entire process down to a horrible degree and the entire enterprise is awash in political correctness. ",1.0

" Silly jingoistic pulp history shot through with half truths unsupported and unsupportable claims and distortions. John Lewis Gaddis is a history professor at Yale University but how he can draw so many stupid conclusions from the Cold War is beyond me. Nobody in their right mind would say that Stalin was a nice democratic leader nor would they be likely to say his successors were freedom loving liberals either but the standard neo-con treatment these days is to score points with heavy handed jingoism rather than presenting history as it happened. I'm sorely tempted to call it propaganda.The layout of the book is extremely poor and jumps from one thing to another without any real semblance of method. You will find yourself reading about Stalin one minute then Kruschev the next and finally back to Stalin again. Very confusing and giving the appearance that he has something of an obsession with Stalin.His assertion that the US achieved its amazing industrial power due to a lack of Government intervention is a neo-con line which is not supported in fact. Most US Government war contracts were designed to fulfil Government specifications. His claim that Americans in 1945 lived in the freest society on the planet is unsupportable. Obviously he has never been to Australia New Zealand or Eire. When he said nobody knows how the Berlin Blockade started I couldn't believe my eyes! Both Hilton and Taylor explain it in their respective books on the Berlin Wall.He spends barely a page on the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 and scarcely bothers to explain that the missiles were installed because of fears that the US would invade after the attempted Bay of Pigs invasion the year before. Asserting that this information has only just been released from Soviet archives does nothing for the argument. Blind Freddy could have seen that.When the Soviets or the Chinese cracked down on insurgencies in their own territories or those of a client state Gaddis digs deep for another triumphant assertion that the US never did this but does not concede that the states they supported most certainly did especially the dictatorships they cheerfully installed in Central and South America. Later in the book he does point out the activities undertaken by the CIA in South America but it's scarcely relevant.All the US leaders were great",1.0

" Even though it was fun to read I give it one star lest the brainwashed academics out their suffer further undue influence. This book has been highly misrepresented by evolutionists for decades. One reviewer made this point but failed to back it up with any facts. That reviewer failed to point out that it was in the 'Descent of Man' not 'Origin of the Species' where Darwin first presents man as having descended from apes.Evolutionists apply natural selection to explain all biological development. It's the worse case of reductionism in history. James D. Watson and Edward Wilson were on the Charlie Rose show talking about this book. They described natural selection as the single great development in science since Newton. They claimed to describe this book as great English literature yet they badly misrepresented it as teaching that natural selection applies to everything biological. How could these allegedly great scientists be so unscientific? Scientists aren't supposed to be cavalier in their judgment. Scientists are supposed to be conservative in their judgment.First of all let's quote Darwin himself from this book page 75",1.0
" To illustrate what's wrong with this book I below lift out the central hypothesis which is the theory of Natural Selection.' can we doubt (remembering that many more individuals are born than can possibly survive) that individuals having any advantage however slight over others would have the best chance of surviving and of procreating their kind? On the other hand we may feel sure that any variation in the least degree injurious would be rigidly destroyed. This preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations I call Natural Selection.'The fact is that *all* individuals do not survive all individuals die. Such exactness is important in science and Darwin fails this scientific standard. This seemingly insignificant error in the fundament of the theory gives a cascade of errors later on. It is really quite different to say that the chance of reproduction determines which organisms are left in the world then to say a struggle for survival/existence determines it. The first puts focus on the individual organism (since they reproduce but don't survive) the last puts focus on the population (which doesn't reproduce much but can be said to survive).Throughout the book there is no effort at formalization which is why Physicists Chemists etc. people of the socalled hard sciences(up until the 19!80's when physicists also started to make their science softer because of the problems they ran into) looked down on Darwinism as a soft science employing a magical struggle for existence and intuitive terms like that.It is clear that Darwin having dropped Christianity invested as much emotion into his theory as he could making it a suitable substitute religion for him rather then try to make it a hard science.'Hence we may look with some confidence to a secure future of equally inappreciable length. And as natural selection works solely by and for the good of each being all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection.'The natural force of goodness?

" Arianna Huffington the failed gubernatorial candidate in the 2003 California recall campaign attempts to write a subject to which she has very little actual experience. First Ms. Huffington's premise is that most corporate executives are greedy and therefore laws need to be enacted to hamstring our managers who wish to exercise the best interest of their shareholders. She does not emphasize how any of her so-called 'reforms' will actually benefit long-term shareholders who wish for chief executives to take risks to earn a decent return on their investment. Further Ms. Huffington fails to emphasize how there are already laws on the books to punish chief executives who have abused the trust positions to which they have been appointed. It is the executive branch's duty to punish those who engange in fraud something the Bush Administration is already doing. However we would not hear about that in Ms. Huffington's book because that would hurt her premise which is that Bush is in on the fraud too.Most of the research contained in Ms. Huffington's book is related to stories she has read about not people or companies she has actually chosen to research on her own. As such practically anyone who has a modicum of research experience could write a similar book of her type -- without having any documentary evidence to prove the assertions made therein.One thing that is most lacking in Ms. Huffington's book is the notion that honest chief executives are able to work on behalf of their shareholders and employees. There is a sense that the position of chief executive necessarily entails a sense of greed that will infect the entire operations of the company. In a sense by stating that all chief executives are guilty Ms. Huffington is too leniant towards those truly guilty of malefensense. In truth the system does work",1.0

" If you want a balanced erudite assessment of corporate corruption & it's effect on America read David C. Korten's book 'When Corporations Rule the World'.

She intersperses her facts with quasi-humble attempts to identify herself as an icon of ethics however even she realizes that her 'Republican bandwagon' years have to be accounted for. So...she mentions that while she was giving speeches from that soapbox she had the right intentions in her heart. She actually says 'Now at last we've discovered the truth' or something to that effect.Korten presents facts evidence and nicely balanced conclusions. He doesn't find personal attacks necessary to make his points.Huffy spends too much time attacking mocking & being 'superior'. Those qualities are identical to the ones espoused by the arrogant CEO's she's writing about. Apparently those qualities are still making money for some people.Save your money - if you're concerned & want the facts read Korten's book. ",1.0
" Arianna Huffington proves in this book that anyone can write a book today if they are outrageous enough in their attack regardless whether they have anything new to say. Her book is a compendium of facts and figures well-known to anyone who regularly reads Business Week Fortune and other business press --- sadly her work lacks even one original piece of research or one new fact that she herself dug up. This is clearly a book written entirely from Lexis Nexis and Google searches.Aside from the lack of original research Ms. Huffington's style grates on one's nerves. Her writing attempts to be overly cute but comes across with all the clever cynicism of a high school sophomore. She excells at moronic cliched name-calling (beginning with the title itself) as if her sticks and stones will somehow solve the much deeper problems in corporate governance and auditing about which she clearly knows little except the most superficial of information. Her so-called quizzes embedded throughout the book were equally immature. Far better that she should leave her pitiful attempts at humor of that sort to people like Al Franken Molly Ivins Dennis Miller or Michael Moore who actually are funny and have the intellectual breadth and cultural repertoire to actually pull off real satire.I suffered my way through the entire book mostly out of disbelief that a woman whom the press consistently dubs as intelligent could write such a shallow childish ineffectual work about a truly serious set of problems in our modern capitalist system. Having read this book I see that her depth of knowledge and her persistent literary grandstanding through empty name-calling made her at least as good a candidate for governor in California as Arnold. They make the perfect pair for a state in which shallow superficiality reigns supreme.This book is the perfect purchase for readers with high school educations who have never seen a copy of Business Week or read the business section of the New York Times. For everyone else I suggest you spend your money elsewhere (spend it on a serious book like The Best Democracy Money Can Buy or Paul Krugman'sThe Great Unraveling). ",1.0

Anyway Huffington is not only a poor poster child for the fight against corporate and government greed she's not much of a prose stylist. I started counting cliches -- the favorite clutch of the bad writer -- on the first page and gave up when the count hit double digits before the end of the first chapter. This clunky offering features nothing that hasn't been covered at excrutiating length by such esteemed people as ex-Sen. William Proxmire (D-Wisconsin) and Citizens Against Government Waste. Huffington doesn't deserve to be counted in their company. Readers and environmentalists who drive hybrid cars (such as Huffington) sometimes cringe when trees are felled to produce a book. I agree with them. And in this case I feel sorry for even the ink and glue. ",1.0

This book has been torn down and put back together so many times that it is a hellish mess. Language methodology has changed and evolved over the nearly 25 years this book has been in use and now this book doesn't know what it is or wants to be. The exercises in the book are worthless. All the instructions are in Spanish from chapter 1 on and the students cannot interpret them which renders the activities useless. Dicho has had a good long run. It's time to shelve it and move on.

" I bought two of these but was disappointed in their design from the beginning. First problem all the shelves are the same depth of 8 inches so none of the regular toddler size board books are even visible when you put the books in the shelves. I would have assumed they would have made the top shelf with 8' depth the middle shelf with 6' depth and the bottom with the 4' depth so could display a variety of books but no all the same. Next problem is that the only books that look right in this display have to be at least 12'-14' tall but then the books tend to start leaning out at a funny angle toward you at the top. Besides most toddlers prefer the 5' x 8' size toddler board books so their hands can manage them. We ended up buying CD storage boxes to hold most of our toddler board books instead.We got this toddler bookcase with the natural canvas but this red canvas one I would be very afraid would very likely stain books. Avoid this item and go with the commercial grade Jonti-craft single sided display (or double if you have large space) with the masonite dividers. We borrowed 2 of the Jonti-craft ones from a preschool teacher friend and our kids are happy to be able to again find and see their books that have been lost in this canvas book hider.

Adding only a documentary is not reason enough to shell out 40 bucks or more for the same movie I already have on blu-ray.The first two Ultimate Editions are truly beautiful sets. The artwork and all the extras really make these collector's items for any fan of this series and I was looking forward to purchasing all the films (again) on blu-ray.

" When Warner Bros. introduced this ultimate edition set last year my wife was thrilled. Naturally I ordered them for her as she is a huge Harry Potter fan and I enjoy the movies as well. When we received the first 2 Ultimate Edition movies we were blow away by both the packaging and the amount of extra content included. For the first time in a long time we felt like we were really getting our money's worth and eagerly awaited the next two movies. Well the day the movies became available for pre-sale I slapped our order in and we anxiously awaited the release. Now a few weeks ago I did a little browsing online and realized that neither of the two Ultimate edition movies releasing this year contained extended editions of the movie which was one of the main reasons we purchased the set last year. We've owned both the HD-DVD years 1-5 special box set and then upgraded to the Blu-Ray version(still own these). After discussing it with my wife she decided she still wanted the Ultimate Edition's this year (3 and 4) so I kept our preorder. Well today we received the products in the mail and before I get into anything else I have to rant a little bit.First thing I noticed with this years Ultimate Editions the boxes are MUCH lower quality than last years. My wife unwrapped year 3 and the way they have it packaged is very flimsy and easy to tear which she did. They added a holographic cover to both movies this year which looks great but the way they have it packaged its going to rip and tear if you plan on watching your movies.Gone is the magnetic snap that clasped the case shut in years 1 and 2.Both of these 'Ultimate' Edition movies seem to be cheapened and lesser in quality not to mention the lack of extended editions of hte movie which is why MOST people purchased them in the first place.Warner Bros. knew that people were going to buy these especially those that had already slapped down the money for Years 1 and 2. Late last week I wrote a letter to Warner Bros. asking them why they decided to not include the extra content from the movies that we know exists (it runs on the family channel).I do NOT suggest picking up Years 3 and 4 even if you already own years 1 and 2. 1 and 2 are totally worth the money and are great sets even if you own the first two movies because they add to them. These sets add nothing are not worth the cost and ruin what could have been an excellent set to own..",1.0

I can't believe WB thought they could release the first two with extended scenes and then skip out on the 2nd two. I won't be purchasing this to see the documentaries however tempting it might be. What a waste! Don't support WB until they add in the extra scenes. ",1.0

" The movie is needlessly dark and violent. For instance we didn't need to see Voldemort chop off Wormtail's hands. The filmmakers seemed to have forgotten these are children's books. In fact the problem bizarre as it sounds is that the director didn't understand the source material. For him magic is whiz-bang carnival tricks. But in the books magic is an everyday thing for the characters not a fourth of July celebration.Victor Krum looks like he's about 30 years old. The Durmstrang boys all look significantly older the Hogwarts boys. The Beauxbaton girls are dressed like Swedish flight attendants. Fleur is a seductress in the book but in the movie she's a plain-looking girl who only gets to speak once. Both of the schools enter to cheesy choreographed routines that look like they came from Cirque du Soleil. And was it really necessary to have a gratuitous shot of the girls' asses to let us know the boys were all worked up? It's more than a little skeezy objectivifying 14-year-old girls.The director is not at all comfortable with special effects. The underwater and maze scenes are just awful. You can see better watching any Saturday morning cartoon.Rita Skeeter added nothing to the story and only served to show up every so often to bring the plot to a screeching halt. Miranda Richardson vamps it up so much that her words take on an unnatural cadence. What results aren't even sentences. She totally totally missed the mark. Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort and Brendan Gleeson as Mad Eye Moody are both excellent.And when did Ron become a hippie? ",1.0

" Afte rthe rousing achievement that was PoA this was a HUGE disappointment. Ok so the opening was all great & suspenseful(did anyone but me think of Pyscho when you saw the Riddle house through the window?) But it just went completely downhill from that point on. Harry Ron & Hermoine go off with everyone to the Quiddich World Cup & all of a sudden there back to Hogwarts before you can even say Quiddich. Also before anyone can even sit down to eat the 1st feast at Hogwarts the other schools are being introduced? WHOA WHOA WHOA! Rewind back up a sec. The projectionist hasn't even had time to sit down yet. Plus even though everyone knew who the villain really was they could(and should)have added some mystery to it. The argument taht Harry set off teh Dark Mark was much too brief too. It wen tlike 'He did it. Harry-'No I didn.' Ok that settles it mov eon. Oh also what was with Barty Crouchs' voice being so high? Did somebody kick him in the you know where? But at the end of the movie he sound smore...uh...manly. Plus as was said I didn't like Dumbledore. Ok so he's suppose to be Harry Potters friend & perhaps mentor & he's shoving him against the wall? I don't think so. I thought Dumbledore was presented best in PoA as well as it being the best film. The tasks weren't nearly as fun & enjoyable. The best IMO was the dragon even though as was said it didn't even look like Harry was scared at all. Like it was obviously not even there. The 2nd Task was way too fast & it was hard to see. Plus the Merpeople looked like Medusa. Ok. The Yule Ball was ok right up until they all started dancing to the Wyrd Sisters. I didn't know Krum headbanged. Oh before I move on when the schools weer introduced what was with the dancing? I thought I was watching Rent. Ok back to the Yule Ball. All that was missing in it was a mosh pit. I was SO waiting for harry to get on stage & jump into the audience. My dad says they are trying to get a modern feel to the films but that was too much. Also concerning the Yule ball I di wish they would have talked about the Giantess thing. Or taht the actress to play Madam Maxine was..uh...not as skeletal. She looked skinnier than Voldermort & he just got his body back. The maze was Shining-like & fairly creepy although like was said quite brief. Oh & when Krum is under the spell of the Imperious Curse & his wand is lite he looks RIGHT AT HARRY but DOESN'T SEE HIM!!! RIIIGHT! Finally we get to what everyone was waiting for Voldermort & the Death Eaters. But another HUGE joke that was. I had heard Ralph Fiennes eats up this role with his slimy evilness so I was REALLY looking forward to it. But those reviewers must have been seeing a different movie. What I saw almost made me laugh out loud it was so ridiculous. I think 1st of all he needed the red eyes to make him look scary. The blue just didn't make it & the nose wasn't enough. I said it a few times beforee this scene will make or break the movie. Although truth be told this scene could have been great & everything else would still have been laughable. The Death Eaters looked like they just came from a Masquerade ball. The only saving grace of this film was Mad Eye Moody even though we knew who he was so there was no suspense. I have heard people say that he was too harsh & grouchy. But hello in the book whenever he spoke Rowling would say 'he growled.' So you(or I did)assumed he was always...for lack of a better word moody. I also read that teachers would never do something like that to students(think Neville.) Well my comment to people who have called Moddy's character a masochist is he's suppose to be unorthodox. Just look at what he did to Draco. Oh...one fianl note when th eimposter was revealed(well ok revealed to Harry & the characters not to the audience)his face MELTED! I was reminded of that dream sequence in Poltergeist when the guy rips his face off. Ok sure it was scary for kids but anyone past the age of 15 is gnna find it all silly. The great thing about the books(and 1st 3 films)is no matter what age it's not silly. Ok maybe the werewolf thing in PoA was silly. But that's another review. ",1.0

" My lousy score does not reflect the movie at all. In fact the movie was a pretty decent solution to handling the gargantuan problem of turning a behemoth plot intricate book (My personal fave of the series) into a two plus hour movie. (Disredarding several COMPLETELY out of character Dumbledore scenes) No rather I'm giving this dvd a lousy score because of the ridiculous sales tactics of Warner Brothers home video. What gives Warner the right to charge an extra five or six bucks for special features? No seriously. This DVD is JUST the movie. Nothing else. If you want the extra features you have to buy the 'special' version something new for the Harry Potter series. It's funny I don't recall having to pay extra for special features on the other Harry Potter flicks or any other new DVD releases either for that matter. I guess Warner considers its customers to be pretty gullible and sadly when I see the 'Special' version of GOF is in the top seller list I guess the underhanded tactics are paying off. It's only a matter of time before this sends a message to the other video companies that it's okay to shaft the consumer. Congratulations Warner this is the best movie I have ever had to boycot on DVD. ",1.0
" The Harry Potter movies have been an everlasting source of comfort for me. I was always promised a good faithful script nice acting and stunning visuals. But....Something along the road didn't quite work for Goblet of Fire. What didn't work however? The first three movies ran smoothly were great and didn't have any problems. What happened?It's Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts and sometime has passed since he last heard from Voldemort. But quite suddenly Voldemort supporters start springing up promising terrifying results. On top of that Hogwarts is hosting the Tri-Wizard tournament; a Wizarding competition.....And Harry might just have his first crush....Now before I start with the bad let me start off with the good....It's always best to start that way now isn't it?Rupert Grint gives a solid performance as Ron Weasley. He might just be the best young actor in the entire cast. He delivers his lines precisely as great facial expressions and is just a way to watch on film. Robert Pattinson does a fine job as Cedric Diggory and makes a welcome (if not short) addition to the cast. Oliver and James Phelps are back as the two Twins and are hilarious once again. Tom Felton shows true professionalism as he steals every scene he's in even if he only has three lines in the entire movie!As far as adult actors go Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy and Alan Rickman as Severus Snape steal the scenes they're in. Jason is devilish as Mr. Malfoy and nobody could play Severus as Alan can. But it's truly Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort that's the wonderous performance. Ralph has always been a favorite as mine and he practically is Voldemort. Mr. Fiennes's acting is superb as you find you can't take your eyes off of him....even if he has no nose....But all reviews have to have a negative side; even in the case of Harry Potter.I cannot fathom any idea as to what happened to Emma Watson. Her acting vastly improved in Prisoner of Azkaban and she was showing promising results as Miss Granger. But suddenly it was like as if she had suddenly taken a class on how not to act. In every scene Miss Watson is in she's either A) Looking as if she's ready to cry B) Getting ready to yell at someone or C) Smirking very stupidly into the camera. What happened? As my title suggests... Perhaps it was the script? Surely the script however does not give word for word what expression to use at every second however! Hermione Granger has left the building and we have indeed been left with an empty shell.The same thing goes for Daniel Radcliff; his acting even takes a detour! He only has one expression on the entire time of the movie and comes across as very bland indeed. Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter was an atrocious mistake on every level. She hams the role up too much; the acting coming across much too over the top. Also what was up with Dumbledore? I love the Michael Gambon as Dumbledore but who decided to make him bland? He's supposed to be warm and fuzzy but in this movie comes across very cold and unsympathetic. We can only blame this on a bad script.The visuals in the film are nothing to write home about. Everything looks positively dark and dreary; which isn't very appealing to the eye. In turn this makes the viewer of the film bored as stunning visuals grab the viewers; but there aren't any here. And I know Goblet of Fire is supposed to be dark but is was too overly dark and depressing and not appealing to the eye at all.It also seems the Magic takes a backseat in this flim. As another reviewer said this movie is more like a movie about a School and Hormonal teens then it is about magic. The Yule Ball gets more screen time then it's worth; including a very stupid shot of Miss Watson walking down the steps in a pretty pink gown. The movie focuses more on Hormones and Death and that's not what makes the Harry Potter franchise...Harry Potter.Also there's no Special Features. Seems you have to buy the 2-Disc special edition to get any. Which is bad if you already went and shelled out Twenty bucks for this version; to go out and shell out almost 40 is quite stupid indeed.Me",1.0
" I gave it one star because at least they didn't mess up the title - plus you can't give it any less.A proud Harry Potter fan - of both the books and the first three movies I can only hope to wipe away as much of my memory of this fourth movie as one can.I understand that video is a different type of medium than literature. I even understand that movies have to take a certain liberty in order to portray the many imagined scenes of books. What I Do NOT understand is why you need to spend over two hours of my life showing me what you can do with a large budget.The point of the Potter books is that they are kids books with an entertaining story line - that focuses mostly on the characters and little on the world.Most of the movie consisted of special effects and very little talking. The story did not cohere. The end was the same as the begining and the middle. And the best acting job was done by Voldemort. I always felt the rest of the actors did a good job in the previous movies - however it seems the director of this movie only wanted them to make faces and occasionally yell a line.They didn't even tell the story. It jumped from one scene to the next without even explaining ANYTHING! I only hope that the 5th movie can redeem this one.On my list of Craptacular movies this is definitely #1 it is even worse than Star Wars Episode 2(clone wars) Rocky V and The Punisher. In fact I would prefer to watch Season 7 of Buffy 3x through rather than have to watch this horrible interpretation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.I'm going to have to reread the book just to forget this horrible depiction.

" I confess I too was horribly disappointed to learn that the latest installations of the 'Ultimate Editions' of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and the Goblet of Fire would not be released in extended cuts. I had placed both of these films on my 'wishlist' for Christmas. I immediately contacted my family members and told them to scratch them off of that list. I would not have people I care about wasting nearly $80 of their hard earned money on movies that I already own. It is sad too those movies had great additional scenes - one of my favorites being Snape busting students at the Yule Ball (in the Goblet of Fire) for snogging outside. I couldn't wait to see that added back into the movie.I have read the statements where Warner's claimed that the directors from films 3 and 4 declined to add these scenes back in. Whether this is true or not is irrelevant. The extended versions of these movies exist on ABC Family which means that someone somewhere HAS re-edited the films to include these scenes. Why didn't Warner's use those versions for an extended version disc? The ABC Fam versions are obviously 'legal' since they show them regularly.Personally I am no great fan of all the 'extras'. The only thing that tempts me into buying a movie i already own is if the film is going to be extended and they interview the actors that I like to discuss some aspect of their character. In the case with these films neither occurred. They didn't have extended versions of the movie nor interviews with Alan Rickman (or many of the other older actors). One thing needs to be noted by the studio here...not all Harry Potter fans are children. Some of us are adults who enjoy watching the trained thespians in the films that we have enjoyed for decades. Sometimes I feel like we are slighted when it comes to these boxed sets. ALL the materials seem to be geared toward children. I don't mind some interviews with the younger actors but they need to also accommodate the older viewers. As with the UK versions of the books they should have Child and Adult versions of the films. 'Adult' meaning that the extras would contain information that viewers beyond their teenage years would ",1.0

" A rabid Harry Potter fan I've never liked the film adaptations of the books (with the possible exception of PoA) as they've never really been true to the storyline of the novels or to the characters. Yes I understand that quite a few things must be cut out but it was never done neatly and the story never really held together.The Goblet of Fire film adaptation follows in that tradition. The movie felt like scenes and snapshots randomly thrown together there was no real sense of continuity - this may have been partly due to the fact that each scene lasted about 5 seconds. You get this impression that the storyline is being squeezed in that they were just rushing through scenes as if they wanted to get through them quickly without taking up too much reel space or something.The Quidditch World Cup?! They totally skipped it. One moment you have the audience waiting in anticipation as the announcer (no Ludo Bagman) speaks then the players fly in...and then cut to Harry Hermione and the Weasleys celebrating Ireland's victory back in their tent (just one tent in the movie). That was so unbelievably disappointing even though I didn't like the way they filmed the Quidditch matches in previous films (all that fouling seemed condoned).The arrival of the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang students is weirdly dramatic - it seems all the Beauxbatons students are girls (WRONG try again - Rowling specifically mentions male Beauxbatons students in the books) and all the Durmstrang students boys (oops wrong again - a Durmstrang girl is in fact mentioned in the books). Then it seems that all of the Beauxbatons girls are as beautiful and fairy-like as veela and the Durmstrang boys put on this odd martial arts display.Then the Goblet of Fire scene when the champions are announced...WHAT was Michael Gambon thinking? First of all I've always disliked that ponytail beard of his and I never liked his portrayal of Dumbledore too much. In this film there's this astonishing scene in which Dumbledore shakes Harry and shouts at him demanding if he put his name in the Goblet. Does this ring true to Dumbledore's character to anyone? I was appalled; Dumbledore doesn't lose his temper when he's about to be murdered for God's sake and they want him to start screaming when Harry breaks school rules? Later at the Leaving Feast Dumbledore says a little speech in Cedric's honor completely lacking in force or emotion of any kind as if he's merely reciting his lines and then adding some gestures as an afterthought. There's none of Rowling's powerful language and drama and suspense in this film. None of it.The Goblet of Fire plotline was massacred. I know the storyline is extremely complex but it IS manageable! Didn't Peter Jackson prove that when he adapted the LOTR trilogy so brilliantly? He did miss out some sections but he pulled the story together so perfectly that in the end he really did justice to the novels. There was no backstory whatsoever about the two Crouch men no explanation of motives and when Neville starts shaking in DADA class it makes you think they'll explain why because otherwise his behaviour would be baffling to the audience (those who haven't read the books). No there's no explanation. In the trial scene in the Pensieve (two scenes condensed to one but that's perfectly understandable) there's only one reference to Frank and Alice Longbottom and you won't catch it unless you know the story already.Voldemort...I felt embarrassed. He is the most unimpressive fantasy villain ever depicted on screen (I haven't seen the Narnia movie so that isn't included in the comparison). Ralph Fiennes is a great actor but he was completely out of his element in this role. Voldemort like Dumbledore lacked any real stage presence or force of character and Fiennes employed dramatic poses and gestures that looked completely idiotic. When Voldemort started melodramatically leaping about the graveyard and yelling I started laughing. The direction was the biggest problem I think - I've seen Fiennes in other movies and he's talented. Admittedly Voldemort is a tough character for anyone to portray but then so is Saruman and Christopher Lee nailed him in that performance. Both Lee and director Jackson were LOTR fans so I assume they took a lot of trouble understanding the characters. In any case Voldemort was even more disappointing than Dumbledore. Moody was also carelessly portrayed and they hardly took the trouble to make his eye look like a real one instead strapping some pirate-style thing over his forehead to attach to his eye.The only time I felt anything at all was when Harry returned with Cedric's body and Amos Diggory said 'My son!' - I admit I did get a bit teary-eyed then. Cedric Diggory Cho Chang and Viktor Krum were good Fleur a bit too dull; I had imagined a sparkling young person with icy indifference to people around her but never dull or boring or lacking in vitality.On a related note Hermione is becoming way too pretty. Hollywood is such a sell-out; they're so obsessed with having everyone look good in movies they disregard the fact that in this film at least some characters aren't supposed to look like movie stars. Hermione was great in the first two movies but she's becoming more and more lacquered and doll-like. They've made her hair fall in these beautiful ringlets rather than made it look unkempt and bushy - which is how it's supposed to look. I honestly wasn't so shocked when i saw her at the Yule Ball because she looks like that in all of the shots in the movie. It's the same with Harry - the first thing I ever noticed abt him in the first movie was that his hair was all neatly combed. And Ron's character was once again sidelined - he's never given the same prominence and respect that the novels give him.All in all a predictable massacre of the Harry Potter world. Hollywood evidently has the money to create the perfect sets but the producers writers and directors involved in these movies so far clearly don't have the vision. Maybe if they had commissioned J K Rowling to write the screenplay it would have been a few million times better. Unfortunately for all of us they just didn't. ",1.0

I rented it to see if I would buy it like I have the others. I will not be. I wanted to like it but sadly it is terrible. And it's not got anything to do with the book or the other movies! A movie should be able to stand on it's own even if one has not read any of the books or seen any of the other movies. And it's there that this movie fails the most.

" There is a lot of 'paid' hype behind this HP installment there has to be as none of the hype surrounding this film turned out to be for real. This was by far a very dark Harry Potter and definitely not for younger viewers. This film came very close to earning an 'R' rating and I have no doubt they had to do some extensive editing to prevent it.Besides the 'blood and guts' aspects of this film I found it to be the most boring installment yet even more boring than #2/Chamber of Secrets. There is a long period in this film where absolutely nothing important to the story happens. We see a tiff break out between Ron and Harry that lasts for quite some time in the film and ends without reason.There was a lot of hype in the film itself about how dangerous the Tri Wizards tournament would be yet we found the tournament wasn't dangerous at all it was quite dull by HP standards.

No matter what the reason was for them releasing it this way it is very disappointing because they advertised the entire series to be coming out as EXTENDED....I bought the first two (after already owning them on regular edition DVD) only to find out it was a waste of time because the rest of the series may not be extended... what's the point?

" GOBLET OF FIRE as a book was abysmal. Just awful! Easily the bloodiest of all of the Harry Potter series GOBLET... boasted dismemberment gore and death all of which were transferred to the movie version. It's easy to forget that supposedly these books are supposed to be for fun. The book's plot or lack thereof was even scarier than the violence!But the storyline was the very least of my worries with this movie. The story is made even worse by the haphazard on-again-off-again approach employed by the moviemakers in bringing it to the screen. Just blink and you'll think that an entirely different plot has stolen the screen. The film has absolutely no flow or transition. Jumpy and disjointed is the best that I can say about it.Add to that some of the silliest scenes to ever grace the big screen. First there's Emma Watson's 'Cinderella on the Stairs' scene. Just about as schmaltzy as it gets. Then there's Robbie Coltrane's nonsense as a lovesick Hagrid courting a giantess who is at Hogwarts to chaperone team members from an all girl's school. And some of the dialog between Harry and Ron is so overpowered by their thick British dialects that subtitles might have helped.And to make things even worse the acting just gets worse and worse. A wonderfully wicked cameo by Ralph Fiennes has some redeeming value. For that the movie gets my single star. Don't even get me started about the main characters.THE HORSEMAN ",1.0
" I really liked the first three but I really hated this movie. It's a two hour long movie about the Potter kids going through puberty. Yes I know they are now 14 puberty age but they didn't have to make the ENTIRE movie about it. The plot was very weak because so much of the film focused on the puberty aspect of it. The kids begin to notice the opposite sex fight for no reason girls are emotionally irrational they need to find dates Harry even ends up naked in a bath tub with the ghost girl. What disturbs me about the movie is that Hermione starts dating this bulgarian guy who's at least 17 years old if not older. Why would a 17 year old want to date a 14 year old? When you're in high school and going through puberty even 1 year is a world of difference. Then it was hinted at that their relationship was 'physical' which made me so thankful that I didn't have kids because 14 is disgustingly young to be having sex. Then there was some forshadowing that Hermione and Ron would end up together. It's like Johnny Quest. Everyone wants Johnny to go out with Jessie but she goes out with Haji intsead. Harry's love interest makes her appearance. Some Asian girl with a bad Irish accent. I can't get over the ball scene where all the girls are crying for no reason. Seriously if I wanted to watch a movie about a bunch of kids going through puberty I would have seen 10 Things I Hate About You or The Breakfast Club. By the way NOTHING is resolved at the end of this film. It lacked action to the point where I left the theater with a strong urge to watch Kill Bill vol. 1. I know I didn't read the book but this a MOVIE not a book. Actually I'm thinking of reading the book because it HAS to be better than this movie. ",1.0
" i went to cinema to see the movie and then recently watched it again on dvd - hoping against all reason that my first impression was affected by bad mood or something. well it wasn't - while all previous potter movies are fun to watch watching this one is painful. there is not a single element i could honestly compliment.i was left with an impression that the original cut of the movie was 10 hours long and then the director had to shorten it to mere 2.5. as a consequence the movie is anything but smooth. most of the time it is dominated by short sequences without any connection one to another. on the other hand there is some lenghty sequences that are plain boring and from the point of main storyline - redundant [for example harry potter vs the dragon the ball triwizard schools arrival - i had to use ffd button to go through them]. i understand that comparing with previous potter movies the original book was twice thicker - but this is all the reason to make a really careful selection of the material - what to enhance what to skip. maybe dividing the book into two parts or risking launching one 4 hours-long movie could help. as it is - it is dismal.if the cut is terrible the acting is no better. all adult characters behave like something between village idiots and cheap magicians [dumbledore yells all the time without a reason crouch senior [what purpose does he serve?] is acting as if he were performing some tricks for kids voldemort appears to be more of a naughty boy than evil lord of power] all teenage characters are plain and dull. the sense of drama is missing - and the movie feels cheap. as if after paying foreground actors there were no money left for a decent scenario editing director with a clear vision and skill good quality computer editing/ special effects. shame to waste a nice story.

His whole portrayl of the 'fight' between harry and ron was simply disgusting he had no emotion in his voice and rather sounded like a monotonous slug. EMOTION!!!! He has to make the audience 'feeling emotions deeper than i've ever baby oh oh you got me feeling emotions'. I've left the worst for last daniel radcliffe every year his eyebrows seem to be converging and taking up a larger area of his face. His bushy mat on his head and gaunt eyes made me want to puke on my chanel bag luckily i didnt cos drycleaning is so expensive nowadays.

(3rd movie was lousy as well) this movie made no sense. there was no cohesiveness. the movie was all over the place. jumping from scene to scene without correctly explaining the scene that the movie was in. i was very bored. i did not feel a bond with really any of the characters including harry. the guy who plays dumbledorf needs to be fired immediately he has no personality at all. i have tried to watch this harry goblet of fire movie on cable several times thinking maybe i misjudged or overeacted. i was totally 100% accurate. this movie is horribly bad. as other reviewers have said the movie needed to be longer (example stated lord of the rings) i hope harry potter v is much better.

" Goblet of Fire the movie is an unacceptable hash. Sure the original is a long book. Did the mercenaries running this franchise think perhaps to make it into two movies and sell them both? I understand that a film adaptation of a novel is an adaptation not a copy in another medium but it must still be a finished work in its own right. GOFtm is so disjoint and illogical and the progress through it so unmotivated that a fair amount of what happens in it makes no sense.

" if you read the book you will hate this movie. the books has several strong story lines. the movie had to be condensed so much so that it was completely obvious what was cut out and what wasn't.go to the wikipedia website and you can see a comparision of both the book and the movie.the movie as a piece of art sucked as well. in the first half an hour i honestly couldn't keep my eyes straight. everything was so fast that you didn't see the characters faces for more than a second. it was also very choppy. take a look at the scene where ron and hermione are mad at each other during the yule ball. right after that they are walking out of the ball room without harry. that 2 minutes of film is so incredibly choppy you know somehting was cut out.the deleted scenes don't help either. even if you burned the movie together you'll still be lost.for those who didn't read the book you may like this as a movie. but honestly there wasn't enough to hold your interest except the scenes with mad eye moody. i though dumbldore couldn't get any worse than movie 3 - i was wrong. this guy is awful. he obviously didn't read the book either.i have this dvd because i am a harry potter nut and needed it in my collection. i didn't buy it though until movie 5 came out in theatres just so i could compare them.

" Think about all the worst stereotypes of the melodramatic villain including the satirical ones. They're all rolled into one here but rest assured as you knew from page one all virtue is rewarded and vice punished (except of course when the vice is perpetrated by one of a family of utter paragons then it is written off as mere boyish spiritedness and all is ultimately forgiven). And if you think that sentence is a bit contorted you'd better stay well away from Fanny Burney.Like other reviewers I was led to this from Northanger Abbey. I chose it from the several other C18th novels listed in that because I knew something of Fanny's estimable father's musicological writings and I was intrigued by her career as Keeper of the Queen's wardrobe or whatever it was.What I got from it was how far above her precursors Jane Austen is in terms of clarity of style and depth of characterisation. Reading this book with a C21st sensibility the sententious moralising by the most 'admirable' i.e sickeningly flawless characters is almost unreadable.Here's one taste there's a lot more like this... [Dr Marchmont is a learned cleric adviser to the hero. He had cautioned the hero against pursuing the heroine too hastily because he Dr Marchmont had been disappointed in the character of a lady whom he had initially taken to be a non pareil]'Dr Marchmont as he saw the pure innocence open frankness and spotless honour of her heart found her virtues her errours(sic) her facility or her desperation but a picture of youth; and regretting the false light given by the spirit of comparison in the hypothesis which he had formed from individual experience acknowledged its injustice its narrowness and its arrogance.'If you imagine you would relish 996 pages of that sort of stuff throw yourself unhesitatingly into the delights of this work.I will say that the plotting is about on a par with Sir Walter Scott although the utter certainty of vice and virtue receiving their just due and of the hero and heroine ending in wedlock leaves you only wondering what twists and tribulations they and you will have to go through to get to page 996.

" The problem with any book by Eric Schiller is that he seems to bite off far more than he can chew or he presents us with superficial stuff. He also seems to have zero qualms about rehashing editing hatchet jobs on books that have been previously written by other authors (see Schiller's book on Kasparov for an example). And here as others have observed he quite poorly executes what could have been a good idea -- a repertoire based on the Tarrasch Defense. It's all very frustrating for those of us who wish our chess books to be to be labors of love rather than hurried projects sent to the printing press before they are ready. The Tarrasch Defense deserves far better treatment than what Schiller offers us. I don't recommend this book to anyone. For a far better repertoire book based on the Tarrasch Defense get Jacob Aagard's 'Meeting 1d4' published in 2002. ",1.0

" Really I am stunned. This goes right next to that danged whale movie as a How in the World Are People Finding This an Empowering Story?I was led to believe it was about women playing baseball.No.It was about women who'd rather be doing something else playing baseball about sibling rivalry and a big public service announcement that looks are really important and that fat people are subhumans that deserve to be punished. The only character that undergoes any growth is (surprise!!!!) a guy Tom Hanks as the alcoholic manager who overcomes it when he has Something to live for.Rosie O'Donnell the one athlete in the bunch is a one-note as the fat person we are allowed to make fun of. Madonna is the one-note that well ya gotta have a designated slut if you have a bunch of women together. The dialog really gave Madonna enough to work with that she could have brought more to the character but she chose not to. I am baffled that O'Donnell cooperated in her own pillorying. And really what's with calling her ugly anyway? I'm a het woman and if I looked in the mirror only to see Rosie O'Donnell that would be fine. Oh I know what's wrong--she's not skinny. Got it.We are expected to be appalled at the fake newsreels where the women ball players are made to put on lipstick and powder their shiny noses and we are not allowed to notice that this film displays the same silly dehumanizing emphasis on looks over substance.In the bus scene the little boy is made to terrorize the team members until he gets chocolate. He is of course a hefty kid--just in case we hadn't noticed yet that fat is bad and that women are to blame the mom gets the kid to stop his tantrum with a treat. If this movie addressed how women really behave in groups there would be a scene or two with someone trying to find the little boy something to do during the stupifying bus ride.But you see we can't have women with real emotions in movies. There can be no real drive--only competition between individuals. There can be nothing nurturing or generous--unless it is of the passive subservient kind such as Geena Davis's character throwing the game.What a horrible film. ",1.0

" Is my mistake that I trusted the reviews? That on itself is not a mistake. It is a mistake however not knowing what type of book you're reading that has been rated so highly. It's like watching a movie. If a horror movie gets 5 stars you should not expect to see an Oscar-worthy or a Fellini film right? So the question here is what type of book is this?This is a book about a religious group of Midwestern whose lives seems a little bit too simple where everybody is either great beautiful and smart...or bad insensitive and awful. Life is just not like that. Characters are shallow there are not complexities and there is certainly not much of a plot.The main character is a basketball coach. A man. The author might know something about hoops but believe me she does not have any idea how any men I've been around in 35 years (me being one of them) thinks or speaks. Her descriptions of him the way he speaks etc. are wishful views from a woman or completely stereotypical (e.g. drinking beer after or before anything).Even worse in my humble opinion the author intends to convey through the characters what is right and what is wrong. Black or white. And all associated with God. God and the religious message is everywhere (the main character looks for his faith -or lack thereof- during the whole book) and seems to be in the context of this book at least the solution for everything. Writing about God religion or religious people can be done well and interestingly making it...literature; this book looks like religious propaganda at least to me anyway.And I am also truly surprised to see the author constantly writing the important lines in bold (you don't need to do that if you write well!) and there is plenty but plenty of cliche lines. Even cheesy to be honest and more precise.Now again my mistake was not knowing what type of book I was buying. If you are a religious and simple person (a truly blessing I would honestly say! -and not punch intended) and see life in very small range of grays you might enjoy this book. Otherwise I can bet you you will not. Regardless happy readings! ",1.0

The writing - turns of phrase and so forth - however showed real skill and I think Ms. Hunter will someday write a very good book.

" Nicole Hunter's book Waiting for the World to End is a unique mix of several genres which is sure to catch on. The style of this book took great creativity and I applaud her effort; however this was not one of my favorite books. The characters in the book are simple and a bit dull. I had trouble feeling emotions towards the characters and the predicaments in which they found themselves. Some of the situations in this book were fairly predictable making it a boring read. I could have easily put the book down half way through and never given it a second thought. The entire time I was reading I was waiting for something to happen in the book to make it worth my time. That something never came. I was excited that the author chose to use the Indiana Dunes as a setting in her book and I do believe that to be a good decision on her part. I frequently visit the dunes and I was extremely disappointed with her description of a place that means so much to me. The Dunes are so beautiful and peaceful I really would have liked their description to be more accurate and over all just a lot better. I have no doubt that Nicole Hunter's future books will be better and I will read them. This first book however needs much improvement before being considered an average good book. ",1.0

" This book contains many problems that we face in the world today and I thought this wouuld be a great book because it relates to our lives. I enjoyed the beginning of the book but then it just began repeating itself over a span of about 250 pages. The sad thing about the book is that after spending your time reading it the end leaves you with exactly what you began the book with . NOTHING. There were really no deep twists in the book since everything was so predictable. Every person has someone they want to be with wheter its a fantasy or for true love and thats how the book started. As expected 250 pages later the couple has the opportunity to get together and leaves us with nothing. Some may like this but I found it to be a waste of my time. I see Olsen as a stalker who could end up in jail. He is a bsketball coach with one player of his who is also his student in english whose mother he is attracted to who he thinks of as his own. He had the opportunity to have a child and chose not to so now he finds a kid who isn't even his own and 'loves' him I believe just to get to his mother. I do not see why Ben doesn't notice this and even after that Ben goes to Tucson College and Olsen 'happens' to get a job there as well.

Worse the extremely useful chart of prices in the South during the war is just blank. Whomever was copying the work didn't bother to UNFOLD the sheet where this data was printed making it wholly useless.In short great book but a disappointing edition. Clearly not worth the $35+ price I paid but if discounted further it may be worthwhile. However please be warned before purchasing this there are margin marks throughout and there is no price chart data.

" I wanted to like this book. Back cover blurb promised a touching story about a blind nobleman and his determined nurse. The writing I glimpsed was clear and fun. But the characters and ensuing story was irritating beyond belief.Samantha was more petulant than helpful. She seemed to help her blind earl by baiting him then running off when he truly needed her. (Leaving him to nearly bleed to death on the floor snarking at him to shoot himself when he was drunk and poised in his library looking for any meaning.)And by the time we get to her big secret she ceased to have any redeeming qualities. Instead she came across as the same selfish little twit of a society girl we learned to hate in absentia. (She loves him let him love her then abandons him because she can never atone for her earlier abandonment.)Meanwhile we had a truly engaging hero in Gabriel. A man who's life is turned upside down by blindness and desperately needs a guardian angel to show him a new way of living. We even have fun background characters in the servants family and that silly dog. He was a hero without a proper heroine.If this is an example of Medeiros' work find another romance author. Her stuff is half baked at best. ",1.0
" What in the world was Teresa Medeiros thinking when she wrote this book? I have read many other books by this author and have been delighted by them. This one made me so upset and angry that I've waited two days to write this review. Every time I think of the way this plot twisted (and then twisted again) I get mad and I feel cheated. The only way this author could have been more successful in writing about things I REALLY don't want in the plot of a Regency novel would have been for her to get my complete list. She did manage to leave out a few of my all time no-no's but not enough so that you would notice.I began to read the book (without any idea of what it was about) and was thinking that it was going very well. Then I began to wonder why no background information was given for Miss Samantha Wickersham. The book continued Samantha (the nurse) was making inroads into the torment and self-pity suffered by Gabriel Fairchild (the blind patient) and gradually bringing him back into the realm of the human being. Still no background information except for things such as Samantha saying 'my sister' or 'my parents'. Samantha won over the hearts of all the servants with her concern for her patient who had been blinded while trying to save the life of Admiral Lord Nelson aboard ship during a naval battle. I did not rebel at all when the two lead characters began to be attracted to each other after all that's why I read romantic fiction. Then the whole thing went to pieces.I will give Ms Medeiros credit I NEVER saw that plot twist coming. I just wish she could have resisted temptation and not done it in the first place. If you want to read a story about a shallow self-centered cowardly heroine this is the book for you. And Samantha doesn't learn from her mistakes (in my opinion) because she compounds the mistake by making the whole list of them all over again! And I absolutely cannot stand it when an author has a man vow that he is so much in love with one woman that there can never be another in his life (after all he is supposedly diligently trying to locate her!!) and then proceedes to prove to us that oops sorry didn't mean that. And in this case in such a short space of time (several months) and in such a horrible situation. What in the world was Ms Medeiros thinking with the episode which occured the night before Gabriel was to sail off to war again? Awful! Simply awful!As you can tell from reading all of these reviews this book has at least one plot twist. I cannot be as specific as I would like because it isn't fair to spoil the plot for other readers. If I could be specific I would have REALLY blasted this book. A favorite author of mine but definitely a book of hers which I will throw in my to-go box from a distance of 10 feet or more. I'm mad! ",1.0

" It seems that Simmons/Stanley have become so full of themselves at their advanced ages that they now believe that extremely weak songs by the 2 of them (Just think 'Hot In The Shade' or any of the other embarassing efforts on their collective parts) are much better than anything Peter or Ace may have to offer. In fact this whole album feels like Paul & Gene saying 'Ace Pete -- we have the power here & we're still (...). Our songs are far superior to anything you have a part in and we're REALLY Kiss not you!'Wrong fellas. Dead wrong.Ace's sole contribution 'into the Void' is light years beyond the rest of this (stuff). Granted Pete's song (as sappily penned by none other than Paul) is not good either but wouldn't it have been nice to get one last classic KISS album as opposed to Gene/Paul scraps? Guys you ain't the band by yourselves no matter what you think. (...) the 4 of them didn't even play together on most of this album. Even a (bad)effort by all 4 throughout would have somehow seemed fulfilling in a weird disjointed sort of way -- at least they would have failed as KISS (more Frehley would have prevented this fate I assure you) instead of Simmons/Stanley's musical rummage sale which was the product that we actually got (Ace & Peter are FULL members guys whether you like it or not).I grew up a masive worshipful fan. As I get older the egos of Stanley/Simmons now overpower what might have been an awesome finish to one of my favorite bands of all time. Don't waste your $$$ on this disc. Buy some classic Kiss & wait for Ace's next solo instead. When they were a band they (were great).

After listening to PC a few times I was so disgusted that I took it out of the CD palyer and listened to Carnival again wishing that Bruce and Eric were back. I wish I could get a refund on PC and go buy the new remastered Asylum. THAT was KISS at their greatest. On Creatures Lick it Up and Asylum KISS rocked period. They were not commercially minded trying to sell you a KISS can opener or some other piece of crap IN THE CD JACKET for crying out loud! The music on PC is marginal at best. They traded in two superior musicians Bruce Kulick and Eric Singer for commercial gain.

" This book is mostly about Mengele's personal life and his life on the run. Thankfully it only spends one chapter on his time at Auschwitz. The most valuable part of this book is where the authors discuss the media circus that started up around Mengele which continued even after his death. Simon Wiesenthal is a businessman who seeked to profit from the hunt for Mengele. The chapter which discusses Auschwitz includes some information from the controversial and mysterious 'Miklos Nyiszli' whose existence is doubtful. The book's one strong point is that it dispels the myths about Mengele the extremely dangerous comic-book character with superhuman powers of escape and evasion. It gives a more realistic portrayal of Mengele as a very capable and skilled doctor with some personality flaws growing into a lonely depressed old man. Mengele's evasion was the result of being highly alert having dependable friends and sheer luck. This book cannot be taken as historical literature because of the non-objective point of view it is written from and it cannot be taken as a biography because of its GLARING OMISSIONS from a period of Mengele's life in the 1960's so it can only be categorized as 'Holocaust Literature' and it comes with all of the usual bias and slant.

I would much prefer if one size was sized for the 4 fingers and the other for a single thumb. Otherwise it is extremely difficult to visualize where the pressure you apply actually goes.My girlfriend picked up on a similar issue in the fact that the thumb side needs to be shorter than the finger side.

" This book is very typical in the arguments presented by the majority of the Oneness position. In its attacks against the Biblical teaching of God's Triunity this book spends the vast majority of the time attempting to prove that Jesus is God which everyone believes anyway. The remained of the book is dedicated in attempting to prove that Jesus is the Father and Holy Spirit and that water baptism is required for salvation all of which are false doctrines.This book's scholarship was extremely poor. The author attempts to 'spin' nuances of Greek grammar to somehow aid his position noting that the Greek word 'kai' translated as 'and' in the Bible is sometimes also translated 'even.' So his main argument is that the Epistles' introductory remarks like 'Grace to you and peace from God the Father AND our Lord Jesus Christ' really means 'God the Father EVEN the Lord Jesus Christ.'This futile attempt is thoroughly dealt with in Gregory Boyd's book 'Oneness Pentecostals and the Trinity.'The theological presentation and scholarship of this book is on par with the Jehovah's Witness Watchtower publication 'What does the Bible REALLY teach.'

" The only reason to even give this film one star is because of its attractive leads. Set in a cabin it feels stagey like an adaptation of a play that never leaves its set and therefore gives you (pun intended) cabin fever while watching it.Christopher Stapeleton is a competent actor and could probably give a great performance but he isn't directed all that well here. Missy Crider famous for soft core films is surprisingly better here than she is in other material. The two actors look great together and could actually produce some sparks in the right film together.'Seclusion' feels like a lost (and overlong) episode of 'Red Shoes Diaries' even up to a somewhat ironic ending. However the actors and filmmakers have no nerve. We get nothing but coy G-rated network television-quality love scenes in a film that is ABOUT an elicit affair. Even in the morning after scene Stapleton gets out of bed with the camera staying well above his waist and then he wraps the obligatory sheet around himself although he is all alone. Afternoon soap opera actors show more nerve.Most annoying is that the DVD cover is they type that just shouts 'sexy' while the film could practically play on any local TV station without offending even the biggest prude.So just what is the point of this movie then? If it uses sex to sell itself but is in reality so completely chaste then why bother with making it? That question is being asked too late. The real question is why would anyone--knowing all of this--want to buy it?I look forward to more from Stapleton and Crider but hopefully next time they won't be so chaste and prim. ",1.0

It's the constant talk about class and who is good enough for whom and the woman and man who just can't seem to get together until the very end when they admit their mutual love. It's all very tedious. I don't find a clever word or thought in her books. I only got through 1/2 this book and then in boredom threw it aside for SINISTER STREET by Compton Mackenzie. Besides there were many characters introduced throughout the novel and I couldn't keep them in mind. They were not at all developed as characters. They were relatives and friends and I didn't care about any of them for they were not portrayed in enough detail to distinguish them apart.I guess I will give up on Austen. My favorites are Trollope and Hardy. Sinister Street so far is superb. One really understands Michael Fane and his little sister! ",1.0

" I must say Jane Austen is incredibly boring and all her novels are stories of women's aspirations to marry wealthy and noble men to support them. Most great literature is so wonderful because of its timelessness touching on universal feelings and ideas. While it may have been groundbreaking in its time it is so dull now. We women have already established our desires of equality in culture and have already acknowledged at least an inkling of what feminine independence is but this novel is a back step. Also it is so predictable. Of course all of the characters will end up married and most likely to their man of choice. This book is dull and predictable and is restricted by its time period. If you want to delve into the past then maybe pick it up but otherwise it's unexciting and it still feeds on social classes and marriage as a woman's reliance on a man for social and fiscal support.

" I had to read this book in my Final Year at High School and I didn't like it one bit. Now it is 25 years later and I re read it and found I didn't like it anymore the second time around.

" I bought this video because I enjoyed the other aerobic tape in Jane Fonda's personal trainer series",1.0
" The aerobics section of the video--which is of course the longest section--is a disaster. The moves are complicated change very frequently and are given little or no verbal explanation. To make matters worse the camera almost always remains at the front rarely giving a side view of the acitvity--even though it's desperately needed in order to have any hope of deciphering the group's complicated footwork.I chose this video because I'd been very happy with the Jane Fonda exercise video is used back in my college days (over 10years ago). Needless to say I was very disappointed. While I might occasionally use the video's stretching segment I doubt I'll ever again use the aerobics section again . . . pretty disappointing considering that I primarily bought it for the cardiovascular workout.

" My wife bought this for me as a stocking stuffer for Christmas to use on travel when staying in hotels. Unfortunately it will never be used due to the terrible design and manufacturing. I removed the product from the box and emptied out all of the parts on the bed only to find out that the parts weren't all supposed to be detached from the product. The detached parts consisted of a couple small plastic chipped or broken pieces the tuner dial (knob) and the razor holder. The tuner knob is what the chipped plastic pieces go to thus the radio is not even worth attempting to operate. The razor holder has plastic nubs that lock it in place to prevent it from falling off however on mine they are shaved or broken off on one side rendering it useless to attempt to hang a razor. Additionally there is a large crack in the plastic on the back side of the product near the lower-mid section that goes all the way through. Although this was clearly enough to warrant returning the pos I inspected the device further for mere amusement. The am/fm selector switch was extremely difficult to move and took all of my strength and multiple attempts to finally slide it. Then I tried to mount the suction cup to the shower without success yet I did finally get it to stick to my bed post after putting all of my weight on top of it.My overall opinion is that this is the cheapest made junk I have ever owned or seen for that matter.

Fog Free? are you serious? that lasted about a week now it gets so fogged i cant see anything in it.. DONT buy this POS. ",1.0
" This is my first review. I do not write reviews as I just don't have the time. But my experience with this 'Fog-Free' mirror (that I got as a Christmas present) was so bad I felt obligated to write about it. I have been using various shower mirrors to shave for over 20 years and know what to expect. This has been the worst experience.The mirror is not very flat and there is distortion when you look into it. It is enough that some may feel a little sick when using it. The mirror was fog-free for about 2 weeks then I had to get it wet to use it. Then 2 weeks after that I had to get it wet and put the slightest bit of liquid soap on the mirror. I always rinsed the soap off after use with as little water as I could. I have been VERY careful to allow only the smallest amount of water to get on this product.The clock worked for the first week then it would fade out after just a few minutes of the shower being on. It is clear that it is losing all power as it resets every time. There are also small water drops inside the plastic cover over the clock.The light is bright but placed at the bottom of the mirror so you have get low to use it. It would have been better if the 2 LEDs had been placed one on each side of the mirror pointing a little in. This would have made them much more useful. The light starts to fade out in about 1 minute until it is off. After almost 2 months of use the light is stuck on and I have to pull the batteries out to turn it off.The radio works barely. The dial is way too sensitive and trying to select any but the strongest signals is impossible. The dial is 1.5' across and the tuning area is only half the dial.The battery compartment is sealed well. No issues there.Today I opened it up to find out why things are not working any more. Now I know why it is soaked inside. The rubber gasket between the front and back panels is not thick enough. The small ridge of plastic that is designed to push into that gasket and keep it water tight is too small leaving a large gap that allows water to get in VERY easily. The circuit board has parts hanging off by long wires or hot-glued in place and there are bare wires everywhere. If I could post a picture of the inside you would be appalled I am. It is very clear that this product is very poorly designed and should be avoided. Buy a different product. ",1.0

" Just when you thought 'Samurai Deeper Kyo' was taking a much-needed upturn in quality the fourth volume takes an artistic nosedive right into the depths of schlock. Once again it feels like the writers are pulling random snatches of the manga and pasting them together with the alcohol-fueled nightmares of a third-rate fantasy writer who hasn't taken his Ritalin in the last week. In case you guessed I didn't like it.Anyway His Majesty's identity has finally been revealed -- historical punching-boy Nobunaga Oda who has been resurrected in a temporary body and now wants to conquer the world. Of course he ends up fighting against Kyo revealing that he's also immune to Kyo's ultimate sword technique. Meanwhile Yuya is marched through a field of hallucinogenic flowers (they're fun!) to where Kyo's body is hidden Okuni's secret identity is revealed and Yukimura fights against the expert archer Basara while the forest burns.Oh and Benitora decides to suicidally take on Nobunaga -- leading to another epic fight between Nobunaga and Kyo which is unexpectedly interrupted by a character we haven't seen all season. But Akira has also turned against his former allies and Yuya might end up dead as a result of his weird obsession with Kyo.I'm starting to think that the people behind 'Samurai Deeper Kyo' were just making stuff up at random by this point -- we've got tree monsters evil porn nurses dramatic flashbacks that instantly get forgotten forest fires that start and stop at random and the most anticlimactic man-versus-monster fight in the history of anime. It feels like the writers were just trying to end the stupid arc as fast as possible.In fact the entire first episode is so fractured and hyperactive that it's hard to even figure out what's going on -- and even after that nothing makes much sense. The fight scenes have gotten kind of ridiculous (one of the Junishinsho just STANDS THERE while Yukimura sprints several yards and stabs him!) random stuff happens all the time (random fireballs from the sky!) and major plot developments get shoved to the side. Okuni turns out to be untrustworthy? Eh Kyo just sort of ignores that 'cause she's sorry now.The most insanely silly scene has to be when poor Yuya gets locked inside a block of ice and just sits there FROZEN for about half an hour while Sakura natters on for no real reason. Seriously how about unfreezing the heroine and THEN talking to her huh?And all the characters seem to be doing stuff totally at random. Let's see -- Benitora is suddenly going on suicide missions Yukimura is LETTING himself get shot because suddenly he thinks he's a 'bad guy' NOBODY cares about Okuni's treachery Akira reveals that he has an obsessive gay crush on Kyo (another one?!) and Yuya finally figures out who killed her brother... and promptly stops caring about getting revenge. The only good character development is for Kyoshiro who finally reveals his true power (and a very muscular chest -- topless assassins rule!).The one upside",1.0
" Well maybe that's taking it a little far but I think you catch my drift.Ah 1999. I was coming of age preparing to graduate eighth grade that coming June and to start high school. Who Wants To Be A Millionaire was ABC's cash cow the no-talent neanderthal Fred Durst was still popular and of course millions of giggly kids tuned in to a popular MTV show called 'Total Request Live'. The premise of the show would be to allow the aforementioned giggly kids to vote for a certain music video and try to get it to the coveted #1 spot. Sounds good right? Well... the videos were mostly of the brainless pop genre. The clientele were mostly over-excitable pre-teen girls. And the host Carson 'Carsick' Daly was about as exciting and interesting as a sack of wet diapers.Did I watch? Okay you got me I'll admit I watched on occasion hoping that the Beastie Boys Korn or Limp Bizkit would be on (I was 13 too... I still kinda like the Beasties though and Korn's 'Word Up' is cool). Even in retrospect it wasn't that cool. I remember one time they literally showed about seven seconds of 'Intergalactic'. It then cut to Carsick prompting me to yell to the TV 'I HATE YOU CARSON!' I never watched another god-forsaken TRL episode and my brain cells still thank me for that to this very day!But the real problem lay in the usual TRL fare. Most of it as you all probably know consisted of boy bands and pop tarts getting tons of airtime and of course the less-than-intellegent kids on the street screaming their lungs out just because 'OMGOMGOMG!!! IT'S CARSON!!!!! I'M GONNA BE ON TV FOR TWO SECONDS!!! EEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!' Lest we forget the geniuses paraded on camera during the actual videos' run. 'OH MY GOD okay like I wanna like request the BACKSTREET BOYS because they are like SOOO CUUUUUUUTEEEE!! EEEEEEEEEE!!!!!' Oh yeah and the e-mails scrolled across the bottom of the screen. 'OMGO)MMGOMG lyki wanna reqwezt nsync bcz justin ais lyk ssoooo HAWTT!!!! - Buffy 14' Talk about lowest common denominator... (Hey you wanna hear something funny? I heard some moron from my high school was crying because she couldn't get on the show! HAHAHA! Sad or what?)Sure there was an option to request your OWN video but I don't think one vote for Pantera would make it because it would simply get lost in a sea of the votes of shrieking tweens for their fluffy pop 'muzik'.I think this stupid show is still on but thankfully it's no longer popular. Even Carsick was smart enough to jump ship! Yes folks this was surely a very low point of an already dismal period (1999-2001ish). But thankfully we can pretty much put this one behind us.All the former teenyboppers who love Carson can now bombadeer me with unhelpful votes. Thanks for reading my wacky diatribe. ",1.0

" Have you ever read a book on a subject with which you have some expertise and wonder if the writer is just making things up as he goes along? This was nearly the experience in reading this book by Duncan Lindsey a UCLA professor.The first problem is that Lindsey takes the shotgun approach to arguing his points against the existing child protective services system. Instead of centering his arguments on a few specific issues and developing his thesis he tries to address every conceivable aspect of the child welfare system and liberally scatters his thoughts and comments without a strong basis of analysis. The result is a loose confederation of ideas none of which with a firm foundation for acceptance.The second problem is that Lindsey attempts to address issues for which he does not seem to have actual knowledge. His attack on the legal basis of the child protective system for being a civil model rather than a criminal model is amateurish (at best). His understanding of the social workers management of the case lacks first hand understanding of the field. I wanted to give some examples to explain my points but it would result in a much longer review than what I prefer. It must suffice to say that I believe the professor's expertise is apparently more academic and esoteric than real life.A third problem is Lindsey's contradicting himself in various parts of his book. For example he spends time discussing how children's deaths is increasing but in another chapter argues that death is but a small area of concern for protecting children. He titles this later chapter as 'Child abuse the red herring of child welfare.' Therefore he argues that the current system is not doing enough to protect children from destructive parents but argues that too much of the same system focuses on a problem that is a small issue in child welfare. So which is it?It is unfortunate that the author did not sacrifice a couple of hundred pages and written a monograph on one of his points. Then he could have provided a document worth quoting and considering. Instead we have a lengthy diatribe absent developed charges worth remembering. ",1.0

But I hate it in a cartoon and this film was a super-violent swashbuckling cartoon with the over-the top external performances one normally sees only in an amateur play. No shadows no air of mystery-- overlit like a TV soap opera.The voices seemed dubbed in a studio--unnatural and disembodied and not fitting into the ambiance of the scenes.To top it off the two lead actors' hair was straight out of the 1980's and Rutger's 'White Outfit' looked like it was stolen from Siegfried & Roy's closet. I kept wondering when the white tiger was going to show up.Laughable plot twists awful dialogue anachronistic. Though most of the exteriors of the 'castles' did seem authentic to the period the interiors looked like Hollywood sets from cheap 'Erroll Flynn' movies and to make it worse from the 17th century.If you want to see a film which authentically portrays the extreme violence of that era with brilliant performances and REAL locations check out Roman Polanski's MACBETH.

You have protagonists who are completely unlikeable (especially Kei the main character who is so misogynistic and egostical that it's impossible to like him) male characters who cry and whine like babies constantly (many many times I was yelling at my tv because their actions were completely incomprehensible or else they stand around with their mouths agape yelling each other's names instead of doing something anything) and gratuitious violence that doesn't contribute to the plot (what plot?). There was not a single character on this show that I liked. And to say Gantz moves slow is an extreme understatement. Countless times characters just stand around doing absolutely nothing for long periods of time then the editor will add completely random shots of lightposts and pedestrian signs for no reason whatsoever! Extremely infuriating and frustrating. Add to it the over the top sexual aspects of this show (like a dog molesting a naked girl WTF?!) which served no point except to titillate the audience really turned me off. I like some 'fan service' once in a while but even this was excessive. This whole thing is a mess. Even the animation isn't all that great or special. I just started watching a new series called 'Darker than Black' which is whole better than this dreck. Please take my advice and don't waste your money buying these DVDs! ",1.0

" This series sold out on what the creators probably thought would sell DVDs. I don't mind watching a good anime with cussing violence and some nudity. But that's all this series is. The plot is weak. 2 episodes per DVD is nothing to be happy about either. (Ghost in the Shell",1.0
" I'll keep this brief. To start off my rating is for the series as a whole. This particular DVD would get 3 stars. Now about Gantz. Gantz is an action series with long pauses in the action for random pointless dialogue from people who should be fighting for their lives. If you know anything about the Gantz series you'll know that it is 2 season series (based on a continuing manga of the same name) totaling to 26 episodes. With 2 episodes per DVD that equals 13 DVD's you'll have to buy to finish the series. And just to let anyone who's thinking about going for the entire 26 the ending was made up by the animation team and is most typically described by Gantz fans as 'Horrible' or 'Crap' so unless you enjoy wasting money only to be dissapointed you might not want to even start this series. If you did buy this and you found its concept interesting you might want to check out the manga which is many times better. ",1.0
" This anime is true to the fact that it has extremely mature content. I usually don't care about this as long as it has some purpose and the show has a cool plot. But I found Gantz to be bad all around.First of all I found the beginning to be rather dumb. The main character and his friend are at the subway and a drunk homeless man falls onto the tracks. After they throw the homeless man back on the side a train starts coming. Instead of helping each other climb over the side which was't a big leap they start running down the tracks. One of the guys was over emotional about keeping a hold of his brother's umbrella while running away from the train a stupid umbrella! Well of course they got hit and somehow they are decapitated by the train their heads flying around. It reminded me of some cheesy horror movie like Army of Darkness. I found this scene to be extremely unrealistic and all of the violence to be cheesy like this.Another problem I had was with the main character. The thoughts in his brain are constantly being narriated every single one of them and he comes off as a annoying little brat who complains about every single thing. The other characters that come later are very boring since they are all very similar to each other. They are either complainers or perverted. None of them come off as cool.I still can't get over the onion monster that looks like frankeinstein when he powers up. An onion monster of all things? If I were doing the show I would have chosen something ominous not korny for the first bad guy. It threw me out the dark mood.My last big problem is I found whole first episode as some cheesy hentai show. It was all centered around naked girls and some of the things that happen are just put in there to make the show even more perverted. It has no revelance. If you're looking for a show with a lot of sexual content then you might as well go on and buy some real hentai movies rather than deal with this dumb soft core stuff.I've seem some pretty dumb anime shows but this one has to take the cake. I never thought it could get this bad. Don't waste your money. ",1.0

So with the next shot this tool will make a fancy knot from 2 or even 3 staples screw the plank.

" I wanted to like this film. I was rooting for it. I love artsy sepia-toned horror films like LOST SOULS and THE RING and GOTHIKA -- but SILENCE BECOMES YOU is none of that.It's not a horror film. It's hard to say what it is. I kept waiting for something to gel; a story a theme a point ... something! But NOTHING!The events (it's hard to call this a story) concern two young women living alone in a mansion. Their father was an alchemist. They allude to a 'plan' which seems to involve finding a young man to mate with so they can have a baby.Well one of the sisters picks up a drifter in a bar and takes him home. Then ... nothing much. Lots of talk and flashbacks and superimposed images. I mean LOTS of superimposed images all throughout the film but to no clear purpose.We see images of the young women as children superimposed all over the place. At one point the man is asleep then he's woken by one of the women as a child. But it means nothing. Is it a dream? A flashback? An imagining? Alchemical magic? Does it occur in the future? The past? Another dimension?'Who is beside you?' the man asks without moving his lips.'No one is beside me' the child answers.'You're just a child' the man says.'I am eternally a child' the child replies.Uhm okay.These images (of the women their parents the young man) are constantly superimposed with sounds too. LOTS of magical-poetic gibberish with no clear rhyme or reason.The film seems to borrow a bit from D.H. Lawrence's THE FOX in that these two women become jealous over the man.All in all a confusing mish-mash. Beautiful sets photography sepia colors but so BORING as it's all for naught. Just gibberish and superimposed images and wandering in the snow and just sheer nothing.Yes there's an ending. Or rather the film ends. Don't ask me to explain it. There's a fire. Or was there? It seemed a big fire but then the house seems unaffected. The man seems to have died but later we see him superimposed beside one of the women. One seems to have lost her baby in childbirth (or did she?) while the other woman is pregnant. Was it all a dream? A magical alter-reality? Who knows!I'm sure some people will be bowled over with stupefied admiration but I like a story to go with all that pretty photography.An artsy-fartsy none-horror sorta Jane Austin type Gothic suspense thriller (the women watch an Austin movie on TV) but really WHAT IS IT?

" I recently drove the Pacific Coast Highway from Los Angeles to San Francisco and had such a great time that I ordered this video so that I could relive the experience. If it wasn't such a hassle to ship items back I would have returned it. It appears that the video camera was set up in the seat next to the driver in a stationary position. Unless he was curving toward the ocean which was about a quarter of the time you are just looking at the road in front of you. I think if a person had been filming they would at least have turned their head toward the ocean and caught more of the breathtaking scenery. Imagine just filming a boring highway from your car looking straight ahead as though with blinders on and that's pretty much what this is. On the rare occasion that the videographer left the car to film he seemed to choose less than stunning views to film.

" The magikan company has a great idea to simplify trash disposal via a continuous roll of 'bag' that allows personal adjustments. It was supposed to save space reduce amount of bag used and make it convenient however this system did none of those. For starter the roll is stuck inside the trashcan. Space in the trashcan has been sacrificed for trashbag instead of having refills say.. under the sink? Second reduce the amount of bags used. Quite frankly this system requires you to manually tie up the bag after you cut it and to tie up the top which sort of makes it like a candy pack. The amount of trashbag used just for the ties are absolutely substantial. Third covenience? I hope they were joking about this one because the tie in and tie out every time when throwing trash bag out is way too strenuous compared to traditional trashbag where you just zip and pull. Also this type of bag can not take fluids. Due to the artificial knot created at the bottom it does not have a sealed end. If one wishes to dispose of kitchen waste which constantly is fluid the aqueous deposit stinks up the bottom of the trashcan. The pots and cracks inside the trashcan does not help either thus creating a stink bomb with use.I got these trashcans/ refill roll as a gift and sorry to say they are now somewhere in the trash pile stranded for eternity.

" Thomas Jefferson was a man of the (self-described) Enlightenment. Not knowing anything about Christianity he hated it. He disbelieved in all of its central tenets -- that Christ was Christ not simply a 'moral teacher'; that He was born of a virgin; that he rose on the third day according to the Scriptures; that He ascended into the Heavens; and that he will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead among others.Yet Jefferson called Jesus Christ 'the greatest moral teacher.' How could he avoid concluding that He was simply a liar or a lunatic in light of His claims to be the 'Son of Man' and 'the Way the Truth and the Light'? Simply he argued that His Apostles had 'made it all up.' The Scriptures if Jefferson was right were just one big lie.Pity Jefferson. Having no familiarity whatsoever with the writings of the Church Fathers (knowledge of the works of St. Ignatius of Antioch St. John the Theologian's student at the end of the first century and author of several surviving epistles mandating obedience to one's bishop might have spared Jefferson the writing of his tres embarrassing 'Notes on Episcopacy') he dared to declare the Church a cabal for 'priestcraft's' sake.Silly idea that hundreds of thousands of people would conspire to become monks in the deserts of Egypt (routinely 120 degrees in the shade) Palestine etc. Crazy of Saul of Tarsus to give up a position of esteem among his own people for the life of a peripatetic outcast. The only explanation of these phenomena I can arrive at is that these people thought what they were doing was based on Truth.One can grant Jefferson a little wiggle room in light of his assumption that Roman Catholicism was the oldest variant of Christianity still extant. Yet others in his day (including other members of the Virginia elite) knew the history of the Church well enough to be familiar with Greek Orthodoxy. (Why did Jefferson insist on equating papal abuses with 'Christianity'?) They unlike Jefferson did not have a pathological ('sinful'?) aversion to the idea that anyone knew more than they that their minds were the limit of wisdom. They didn't live the life of Epicurus on a mountaintop like this red-headed prodigal supported in luxury by their slaves. They had not all bought into Satan's sin.Jefferson didn't know as we have seen in the last 8 years that there is a surviving manuscript in Greek from the first century of a large portion of the Gospel of Matthew JUST AS WE HAVE IT in biblical Greek. So much for the grand conspiracy to make 'Jesus' into God. I guess He was God. What does that mean to Thomas Jefferson wherever he is now? ",1.0

" I really looked forward to reading this given all the great reviews and the wonderful idea behind the writing of this book.

It's nice that it is cheap but I wish I hadn't purchased it. The other reviewer referred to Tolstoy's version of the Gospels in brief; I'll check that out instead. ",1.0

" I realize that this book probably has historical significance for the field of psychotherapy. Parts One (Concentration Camp) and Two (Logotherapy) were originally published in Austria in 1946. The author apparently a distinguished psychiatrist spent three years in Nazi concentration camps when he was in his late 30s. His education was circa 1920s-30s at the University of Vienna (Freudian influences certainly abounded at that time.)From a 2003 (and a layperson's) perspective this book touches upon many ideas and not in a particularly concise or unified way. These ideas from my perspective are often the embryonic stages and 'seeds' of thought often more specifically and fully expressed in future and current psychology. Interestingly he questions pure Freudian theory--maybe this was fairly novel in 1946. Self actualization self-transcendence finding an authentic self are ideas later espoused by Maslow Dr. Phil MacGraw and other psychologists. Perhaps the book would have been more effective for me if I had read it in 1946 but I wasn't born yet. I believe the best audience for it in 2003 are psychologists/psychiatrists--there are ideas/'seeds' for graduate students to expound upon and develop.I much prefer The Diary of Ann Frank or The Pianist in terms of artfulness and my developing empathy for the characters than Frankl's somewhat detached professional espousal of Holocaust atrocities.

His opinions when it comes to therapy are unhealthy to say the least and his entire theory is groundless and irrational.In this book Mr. Frankl admits to telling a man that the meaning to that man's life since the death of his beloved wife was to feel pain! Mr. Frankl even went on to tell that poor man whom for whatever reason bought into his proprietary brand of crazy termed 'logotherapy' that he should embrace the pain and even nurture the pain so as to be able to feel it more fully. What??? Therapy??? Psychosis?Viktor Frankl is in my opinion a mentally-ill person whose book has caught on for some reason yet unknown to me. There is no meaning to be found anywhere around this book. ",1.0
" Out of falsehood nothing good can come. Viktor Frankl devotes a large section of his story to Auschwitz and claims to have been there for quite some time noting that 'we had to wear the same shirts for half a year until they had lost all appearance of being shirts.' In reality Frankl spent only a few days in Auschwitz en route from Theresienstadt to an outcamp of Dachau. As Timothy Pytell a professor of history at Cooper Union who has researched Frankl observed a reader of Man's Search for Meaning would 'be stunned to discover that Frankl spent only a few days in Auschwitz' and 'if truth be told Frankl's rendition is contradictory and profoundly deceptive.' Frankl finally admitted the truth in 1991 when he told the magazine 'Possibilities' that 'I was in Auschwitz only three or four days [...] I was sent to a barrack and we were all transported to a camp in Bavaria.'Frankl left Theresienstadt on October 19 1944 and arrived at the Dachau sub-camp Kaufering III on October 25 1944. How then did he come to write his stories of Auschwitz? One cannot avoid concluding that he simply made the stories up. One could also have determined this from Frankl's story of seeing large flames coming out of the Auschwitz crematorium chimneys - a technical impossibility for such installations.One can even identify Frankl's transport from Theresienstadt.

" If you're a fan of the 70s TV showLand of the Lost you will definitely want to steer clear of this bomb. Without a plot and trying to force the comedy down our throats this newly reinvented LAND OF THE LOST is a complete disaster. Yes even with the much improved CGI effects.The film tries to pull in fans of the original by sucking the cast into a time vortex similar to how Marshall Will and Holly were in the original. But instead of being scientifically interesting (if outdated and impossible) this time we get some serious low-brow comedy that misses almost every mark.Those of you out there who also are not fans of Will Ferrell (Talladega Nights) will want to avoid this film like the plague. He's in full-on childish mode getting more groans than laughs (trying to make out with a proto-human while high on a hallucinogenic? Yes. Those kind of antics!). And he's in the lead role as Dr. Rick Marshall so he's on screen in just about every shot.His supporting cast are just as lame as he unfortunately. Anna Friel stars as Holly and her interactions and supposed romantic attraction to Ferrell's Marshall character are probably what'll give most of you a good laugh. It's so unrealistic you'll wish that she'd disappear down another vortex.The more unfortunate cast member Danny McBride (Tropic Thunder) as Will Stanton the owner of an extremely destitute theme park ride plays the fool more often than Ferrell's character and not in a good way (is there one?). Which is too bad really as I like McBride in Tropic Thunder and SUPERBAD.There's not much here to enjoy (in case you didn't notice my review rating). More groans than laughs. More childish than adult fun. You might want to run away from this one as if a T-Rex were after YOU. ",1.0

I don't ever remember Will talking Rick Marshall into kissing Chaka or Will's mouth next to Chaka's groin while they sleep.And the movie industry is wondering WHY most of the movie theater seats are empty these days. It's constant sex humor. It's just not funny.They should've kept it retro and keeping the 3 characters a family just like the series. But no! They have to have Rick and Holly fall in love at the end JUST LIKE A MILLION OTHER MOVIES!Shame on Sid & Marty Krofft for allowing this movie to be made this way.

" No...If your intention was to make an absolutely HORRIBLE movie based on a 70s Sat morn kids show then Land of the Lost is what you'd get. Just brutally HORRIBLE! Of course with Will Ferrell and Danny McBride onboard you know there will be some funny moments. But they are FEW and FAR BETWEEN. Surprisingly this script was so POORLY written that even most of the crude humor was unfunny...And that's something that's pretty hard to screw up! Will Ferrell dousing himself with dinosaur urine after standing under a 'dino dong' to collect it?!? Will daring Marshall and Chaka to 'french kiss'?!? Two sleestak guards having sex?!? I don't know WTH the writers were smokin when they penned this one but I bet it's nick-named something along the lines of 'Career-Killer'...I'm also pretty shocked that THIS kind of stuff now passes as PG-13 when it's chock full of R material. This is NOT a kids' Sat morning show movie. It's a disjointed rambling even confusing movie that all-too-often reverts back to crude toilet humor when the plot stalls...Which is basically every few minutes. If you have kids you'll be telling them to cover their ears and close their eyes with some regularity which I find particularly offensive given the fact that they're making a buck based on an old KIDS tv show. Land of the Lost sets a new standard for modern day Hollywood 'F-em if they can't take a joke' writers and producers...And by standard I mean a new LOW.There is nothing redeeming about this movie...It's not for kids...It's not for adults who used to watch the show as kids...It's not funny...It's simply another bizarre WASTE of acting talent and film negative.

" This is one of the only movies that I will turn off before it's finished. Although I did have to watch the rest of it so I can say I watched Casablanca.This movie is horrible! It is so boring and unoriginal that I can't stand it. The only good thing about it is the cast. Bogie is the man of course and Ingrid Bergman makes the screen shine with her beauty and talent. But that's it.How is it boring? Because all they do is talk. The only moment I felt enthralled is where Rick flashbacked to Paris and the end. That's it. The rest is a bunch of talking and ordering the African-American around. Now I know it's old but it's not based on the Civil War. It's during World War II. A lot of people including blacks got killed so the studios could make this awfulness.How is it unoriginal? It's about a love triangle. You take away the locale and the nazis and that's all it is. Besides there's absolutely no chemistry between Bogart and Bergman. They looked more uncomfortable than in love. A lot of professional reviewers praise it because they base it around World War II. Of course they did the movie was made in 1943.According to the AFI this movie is #2 in the best movies of all time. It's right above The Godfather. Say it isn't so say it isn't so.Final words",1.0
" I'm not a kid by the way nor a teenager. I'm only using this kid's review feature since I'm not a customer. I watched Casablanca recently and my gosh I was disappointed. I really don't understand the fascination people have with this movie. It's a film about unrequited love which frankly doesn't appeal to me. I don't care about great dialogue or 'whimsical' 'beautiful' acting and drama. This is a film from the 1940s and the acting is stagy and the film has no entertainment value. A film where a bunch of people talk for 3 hours is not the greatest ever made. ",1.0

" I have to admit one thing about this book. She got her Civil War facts right which is more than we can say for some authors who have tried writing novels about the war. Other than that I have nothing good to say about this book.Scarlett is one of the most annoying characters you'll ever read about. I realize she's supposed to be that way but frankly I didn't care what happened to her or anybody else in this book. She got on my nerves right from the start.My biggest problem with the book was how racist it was. Critics of Mark Twain call his books racist but Tom and Huck are probably accurate portrayals of kids growing up in that time and place (at least regarding their thoughts on slaves). To have Tom Sawyer make a comment that sounds racist to us is one thing but in this case the author shows her own racism. A slave who came back south after visiting Boston with a Union officer complains about being expected to sit at the dinner table with the white people who obviously didn't know that the black people were inferior and should eat in the kitchen. This was probably her view when she wrote it but if you could go back in time I doubt if you'd have found any slaves who didn't want their freedom or who didn't want to be treated as equals by the white people of the time.I've never understood the popularity of this book or the movie. If you want to read a good Civil War novel try something by Howard Bahr or 'The Killer Angels' or 'A Soldier's Book' or 'Enemy Women' or 'The Red Badge of Courage' or 'Shiloh.' ",1.0

Chunks of pages have begun falling out of the binding. The spine is paper and not sturdy at that.I'm no expert on bookbinding but this casts an image (for me at least) of cheapness over the publisher. I'd like to have thought that for the price this could have been expected to last a bit longer than 4 months.I guess this one's not going to be an heirloom.

" I only knew the story from the movie so I bought this book the week before we invaded Iraq I'm sure at some subconscious level to read a viewpoint about war. The first half of the book was ok I liked the descriptions of the suffocating constraints of upper class society at the time and Scarlett's rejection of them. The devastation of war and the struggle that Scarlett and her family went through were powerful. However the second half of the book completely turned me off to the story. Margret Mitchell's descriptions of the reconstruction were so vile I almost put the book down. Blacks were only happy being slaves they were too stupid for anything else. The only good blacks in the book are the ones who can serve the whites. Big Sam says he had enough of freedom and wants to go back to Tara. He's even incredulous that while in the north whites wanted him to sit at the dinner table with them like he was their equal but he couldn't do it because he is not the equal to whites. Mitchell actually says that he smiles and feels better when Scarlett starts to tell him what to do because someone is telling him what to do again. Mitchell also uses animal metaphors when describing the black characters.At one point Mitchell is describing how the southern whites hate the Yankees so much because the Yankees have money and food and power and they do not yet she doesn't have any sense of irony to see that the whites are in the position that they put the slaves in for centuries.And another thing that I did not like about the book is that most of the characters are serious sociopaths. They kill anyone who breaks their rules of racial propriety. Rhett kills a black man for being 'upity' to a white woman another character one of the Fontaine boys kills a black man for for saying something to a white woman. We are not told what but it is pretty obvious it was sexual so we have the sterotype of the black male sexual prowler. Then the same Fontaine boy kills Jonas Wilkinson for telling black men that they are equal to whites and that they are alowed to have white women!! He doesn't just kill him he cuts him to ribbons with a knife. There are many more examples of this psychotic behaviour. And Mitchell treats these behaviors as if they are to be admired. While reading I kept thinking these people are all nuts. I was glad they suffered and I'm glad they lost the war. I lost any sense of caring about what happened to any of them including Scarlett.Also this is a very anti-American book. Mitchell keeps going on about how awful the Yankees and the Union and the federal government are and how great Georgia and states rights are. Of course states rights here means being able to murder anyone who annoys you. The reconstruction section of the book should be read by everyone just to show why the flying of the Confederate flag is so offensive. It is completely un-American.And one last thing. This isn't a great love story. Rhett is really only a supporting character in the book until the last 200 pages when they get married and for a book over 1000 pages that's not alot. I think people remember the movie more than the actual book.I was really dissapointed with this book. I was looking forward to enjoying a nice read and discovered that it was horrible propaganda.

There are almost no books I feel that way about. I'm a writer and I abhor censorship. But this book is so outright racist it gags.Why should such stereotypes be allowed to continue for generation after generation to absorb?What would the world think of a romantic novel about dashing German SS officers and a beautiful blonde 'maidchen' cavorting charmingly before concentration camp slaves? All the while talking about those slaves as if they were simply 'children' who didn't know any better than to be wearing striped pajamas carrying out humiliating tasks for their 'masters' and existing pleasantly and contentedly in their cute little 'barracks'? Critics would be up in arms. Such a novel would fall into disrepute and no one would claim it to be a great work of literature even if it was well-written.

The dress was 12 yards of green sprigged muslin with only tiny puffed sleeves it was low enough to be a dancing dress and certainly not suitable for a morning barbecue.

" Here we have the local mad-scientist and gland expert (Bela Lugosi) working in his basement lab on his latest project. It seems while doing the usual mad-scientist thing of tampering in God's domain he injected himself with some vaguely defined ape fluid. The ape stuff had some very unfortunate side-effects. Bela now goes around all hunched over and wearing whiskers and a wig (both very phony). He swings his arms as he walks and mingles words with occasional grunts. Tragically the only way he can stand upright as a man is to take injections of human spinal fluid. The only way to get human spinal fluid is to render humans inanimate (i.e. dead). The beneficial effect of the injections has become distressingly temporary; it doesn't last long enough for Bela to get rid of the whiskers and wig. Bela has taken to sleeping in the same cramped cage as Mr. Gorilla his lab animal companion. The sexual overtones of this we won't even discuss.This low-budget thriller is a good example of bad acting and unintended laughs. Bela Lugosi made some truly classic horror films but this clunker isn't one of them. Lugosi and his gorilla pal lurking in doorways and alleys remind one of a simian version of Abbott and Costello. Bela is tall and slender while Mr. Gorilla is short and chubby. The snappy dialogue of the newspaper people is meant to be witty but gets tiresome instead. The WWII jokes hopelessly date the film. The mysterious skinny guy wearing the goofy hat is a silly plot-twist gimmick that emphasizes the poor quality of the story. It's possible that dedicated Bela Lugosi fans or die-hard fans of old horror movies will find value in this movie. The recommended way for anyone else to view this movie is to use it as a 'so dumb it's funny' party tape. Just be sure there has been sufficient imbibing of your favorite beverage to dull the senses.

" I have 3 other pair of ROC pants that are not made in China. I ordered the same color for both pairs and contacted this company to change the color of one if they had not ordered. They said they would make the change as the order had not been placed. I received the pants and they were made in China and didn't fit anything like the other 3 do. I contacted the company and asked for prepaid return address for UPS. The first printable return was too large to get the tracking number on it. This was emailed from Zac. I call back and Dylan resent me one that was still a page large but did have the tracking number. I received an email that UPS had scanned it my account would be refunded soon. I still have not received a confirmation from Backcountry and they tell me that there was no order made under my email account. Fortunately I use the Amazon visa card and there is not balance due as of today the 22nd of June.

" I bought this CD based on the glowing reviews. Unfortunately I wasted my money and am completely dissapointed. There are so many bad compilations of Brazilian Samba music that it's sad. Unfortunatley these CD's come out claiming to be authentic the real Mccoy the ultimate collection. Then people buy them listen to them once then put them in the bottom of their pile never to be listened to again. It's a real shame because new listeners are not getting the opportunity to hear the best of what Brazil has to offer. This is that type of CD. While the instrumentation is authentic Samba that's as far as it goes. You wonder how some of these singers ever got a hold of a mircophone. They are all constantly singin off key and it happens so much that you litteraly start to cringe. The melodies are also second rate with nothing at all memorable. I am a great admirer of Brazilian Samba and this compilation is not a good representation of authentic Brazilian Samba. If you want the real Mccoy that is worthy of your money and is beautifully sung check out anything from Beth Carvalho or the compilation 'Sabma Brasil' from Verve. ",1.0

" I have been an avid follower of John Mclauglin's method of crafting an art called fusion. Though the Mahavishnu days are over and John's prior attempts at smooth jazz have been successful this release is sour and dull. Though John does execute his technical prowess (ie. 'chops') as always and the band plays beautifully the tone of his guitar ensures a lackluster mood when listening. The album is somber. I don't think the pick-up tone distortion or chorus settings on his guitar were changed throughout the entire album. blah-blah-boring-blah. ",1.0

" The original Outrun is a timeless classic. It's one of those video-games that will last forever and it came out of the golden era of wonderful arcade innovations along with Double Dragon and Splatterhouse. Outrun was the first great racer better than Pole Position on the Atari!!!There have been plenty of sequels and spin-offs to Outrun from the kinda okay Turbo Outrun to the just plain stupid Battle Outrun. None really had that extra spark which made the original so amazing. Outrun 2006 may not end up a classic but is still a brilliant game in it's own right.Rekindling that hedonistic free-spirited just-get-in-and-drive-anywhere feeling and sacrificing all the modern racing features for just sheer joyriding pleasure Outrun 2006 is just such an easily accessible game for anyone.As usual it's filled with gorgeous scenery brilliantly blue skies and amazing music. The classic 'Magical Sound Shower' (a great great tune indeed) has been remixed but it also contains the 1986 mix for the purists.The only negative thing I can say about this game is that once you've finished it 5 times (such as I have already) there's not much point in going back to the same old courses. They could have included more.Ah well it's still a game you should invest time and money in.Graphics ASound AGameplay ALasting Appeal C+ ",3.0

" I wish I had read the other reviews before buying this particular video. My two year old does not have any interest in the between episode segments where parents and kids talk about their feelings for Thomas. I think it may have mads an interesting documentary for older kids who had liked Thomas as small children but for little kids it does not hold their interest long enough to get to the next story. Perhaps if the video allowed you to skip the segments or turn them off like the producer notes in movies it would be a nicer experience. ",3.0

" There are ten Thomas & Friends episodes on this 60-minute DVD. These are not just Thomas stories but a mixture of episodes supposedly picked by children who went to the A Day With Thomas event in Penn. at some point. Preceding each story is a 40-second or so clip from the event with parents and children commenting on the TV series. You cannot skip these with the skip button; you can fast-forward but that's a hassle isn't it? This is why some customers are understandably upset.But my two-year-old actually likes the footage from the event -- set to his favorite T&F; songs -- more than the stories themselves. Most of his favorite episodes are not here so he ends up only watching the event footage and clapping every time he sees the mock-up Thomas train with all the happy children onboard.If you own few other Thomas videos I think this is a decent value with ten episodes that more or less represent the T&F; series. That is pretty much every episode finds the engines 'cross' -- I'm starting to get real sick of that word! ",3.0
" I would have enjoyed it more if the hero had some other powers other then being able to read minds which by the way he's not very good at it.Or he should have been able to read the minds of who was betraying him and trying to kill him & his new bride. When the plot seems to be in trouble with no way out he can read thoughts. And only when the heroine is distressedor in trouble. Who only questions him about his ability after she's married to him. And she keeps getting into trouble because he won't tell her anything just keeps patting her on the head and telling her not to worry he will protect her. Which he also doesn't do to well. The plot is long and at times boring. I hope Ms. Feehan stays with her paranormal charactars. ",3.0
" As an avid reader of Christine Feehan I was pretty excited when 'Scarletti Curse' was published. Unfortunately the novel did not live up to expectations. Unlike Feehan's earlier novels these characters were not well-developed and the plot was relatively shallow. There were flashes of Feehan's characteristic imagination but over all it was a disappointing read. ",3.0
" For many years the Scarletti family history has been shrouded in curses and dark mysteries. Whispers of evil murder and insanity have been going around the villagers about the family that rules their lands. They say that no bride has ever survived in the palazzo and considering the number of women who have met their untimely death in what everyone has come to refer to as the Palazzo Della Morte (Palace of Death) it seemed that the curse is true.Unbeknown to the villagers the current don has set his eyes on their healer Nicoletta the woman whose identity they have protected for fear that she will be branded a witch by those who might misinterpret her gift of healing. So how did Don Giovanni Scarletti find out about their beloved Nicoletta when no one has spoken of her to outsiders? Could the rumor be true then that he has powers because he is in league with the devil?THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a dark and mysterious novel filled with suspense and sensuality. Nicoletta is a very likable heroine with her wit and exuberance. I loved the way she seemed to embrace life with such open arms. Her compassionate nature and youthful innocence is quite endearing. Giovanni's character is such a mystery. The way he treats Nicoletta with such tenderness is such a contrast from how people perceived him to be.I must say though that even though the author has done well in describing the atmosphere within the palazzo including the design and architecture lending to the eeriness of the story there were some parts that dragged a bit. I also didn't care much about the political intrigue and thought that it wasn't blended in well with the story. I might have understood it more had the author bothered to actually tell us which date the story was meant to have happened (I'm only guessing 15th or 16th century). I know this seems trivial but when I'm reading a historical novel I do like to know what period it's supposed to be.Overall this wasn't a bad book. I did enjoy the banter between the don and his barefoot bride. You can read about Giovanni and Nicoletta's descendant Antonietta Scarletti in Dark Symphony (which I'm reading at the moment). ",3.0
" This was a great book! But the dialogue between Nicoletta and her guardian just seem to drag on forever! I missed the intense dialogue that Feehan usually devotes to the two leads. It seemed that they had very little interaction except for the last 1/4 of the book. Why such devotion to this mother-daughter relationship when it didn't seem to lead to anything crucial within the story? It really detracted from the couple's story. Other than that the two leads were great and I agree with previous entrys - PLEASE write a book on the other brothers. ",3.0
" At first it was interesting because the character Nicoletta was a free spirit who vowed never to be married to anyone who would subject her to abuse or become servile to. It was when she met Don Giovanni Scarletti she sensed something evil about him and his family. Don Scarletti had possession of her mind body and soul. His dark features were erotic yet frightening to Nicoletta. However I have found myself getting a little bored with the book. It seems as if something that is bound to happen doesn't happen. It's a good read but unfortunately I am getting restless and impatient with the Scarletti curse and the passionate fires between Nicoletta and Don Giovanni. ",3.0

Ms. Feehan seems to have a preference for characters with dark hair and eyes. I need a little more variety please! Ms. Feehan also writes her main female characters to fight desperately for their independence throughtout the book knowing that they will not end against their brooding possessive Hero. I get tired of the constant whining and carrying on. But it seems that the females also go through some magical personality transformation after the first sex scene. I know sex is good but come on.

" I enjoy Ms Feehan's general writing style and loved every one of the Dark Series books...but this gothic started very slow. For over a hundred pages I still felt like the background was still being set and the real story hadn't begun. Finally she gets to the gothic mansion and I felt that THAT is when the story began. Once at this point the plot seems to take up some speed and has a lot of suspense and gothic darkness. Although some questions are answered I felt like she could have taken some of the characters a bit further. I also felt like some of the scenes were startlingly switched for the suspense and I had to go back and re-read a page again to figure out what was going on. I wouldn't re-read this again but would still probably want to try her next gothic to see how that one goes. ",3.0
" I guess I was expecting more. I would like to establish that I love the Dark series and cannot get enough of them. This book however left a bit lacking. I thought ... was going to make more out of the paranormal relationship between the two main characters. I felt this never developed like I wanted it too. I didn't feel Nicoletta was a very interesting character at all and lacked the strength of her previous lead characters. .... There was a lot of build up with not enough punch. If you like the Dark series I would recommend that you read this one if you have nothing else around to read .... ",3.0
" This book read a little too much like a toned down book from her Dark series for me to really enjoy it. Like the men in her other series the hero is laboring under a dark shadow and needs that special one woman to make his life light. He is over protective and dictatorial and the woman can't help but want him. The fact that the curse was healed with a little pop psychology did not help the book either. It is still a pleasurable read but it is not one I wanted to repeat. ",3.0
" I am realtively new to Christine Feehan and have really enjoyed all of her 'Dark' series. This was the first gothic novel I've read in quite some time. I must say that while the book was diverting it was not one of my favorites by Feehan. I didn't find Nicoletta to be all that sympathetic. There were also a lot of minor characters with many names that the reader has to keep straight.Also while Nicoletta's supernatural powers were explained pretty well one never really gets to understand why Giovanni has them or where they come from.But all of that being said it was creepy and certainly kept me reading. I was still thinking about the book this morning as I woke up so that's something. While I wouldn't recommend this book as being one of her best it is certainly an entertaining read. ",3.0

" This release made a big impact for the Wilson Sisters and company. The four singles are all quite good and even some of the album tracks Nobody Home in particular are fairly ear catching. Will Heart be as memorable as the Beatles Stones Eagles or Fleetwood Mac I doubt it. However they did make some noteworthy contributions to the world of rock n roll and a good portion of that is on this album. ",3.0
" While I still enjoy listening to this song 20 years after its release it is not my favourite Heart album. I believe their best work lies in the music they released in the 70's from the Dreamboat Annie Little Queen Dog and Butterfly Bebe Le Strange and Greatest Hits/Live albums.Heart can rock - they still rock to this day and the 1985 Heart album was a commercial success complete with the big hair glam make-up and power ballads but in my opinion that wasn't Heart. That was a marketing recipe for success for Capitol records. The music although entertaining radio-friendly and sometimes charged (What About Love Never If Looks Could Kill Shell Shock) is not organic or idealistic. Lyrically the songs are weak and trite and don't represent the depth and breadth of Ann and Nancy's earlier songwriting talents. Their musical catalogue on Capitol does not compare to the gems they released on the Mushroom & CBS-Portrait labels.I still listen to this album occasionally to remind me of my youth but if I want to hear the REAL Heart I listen to their earlier albums. ",3.0
" It is my opinion that Heart was never the same after the Wilson sisters dismissed lead guitarist Roger Fisher (Anne's former beau) and producer Mike Flicker. This was evident on their first album without their involvement Bebe LeStrange (80). Fisher had a co-writing credit on one track but he did not appear on the album. From that point on Heart had lost their edge. At the same time their commercial appeal was slipping. They made Private Audition (82) and Passion Works (83) but failed to have any significant hits. They were subsequently dropped from CBS (Sony) records.As a matter of survival in the record business Heart had everything riding on the success of this self-titled Capitol album. Producer Ron Nevison encouraged the Wilson sisters to use songs from outside writers and he made Heart sound like Survivor with female lead vocals. I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy most of the songs on this album. 'What About Love' 'Never' and particularly Bernie Taupin's 'These Dreams' are very catchy pop tunes. Incidentally 'These Dreams' was orignally written for Stevie Nicks who rejected it. Heart had their first number one song three more top ten singles and an additional Hot 100 hit from this record which proves my point -- this is pure pop. Of course that's not bad it's just different.For those of us who were fans from the beginning the HEART album bears little resemblance to the rocking and soulful 70's band that made the classics Dreamboat Annie (76) Little Queen (77) Magazine (78) and Dog and Butterfly (78). If you only know Heart from this 1985 pop album you owe it to yourself to hear them the way they were. ",3.0
" While this album certainly isn't the same music Heart was known for in the 70s it brought them back into the music spotlight and brought new fans. Some people who like to act self important wanna call this type of change 'selling out' but look at all the other bands of the past who refused to change - most of them are nowhere and forgotten. Very few bands of that era have a sound that maintains through time. Put 'bands of the 70s' in your search browser and see what comes up. There's maybe 5 bands on that list that continued to produce music successfully thru the 80s and 90s. And Heart is one of them. When it comes to entertainment if you wanna survive you gotta give the fans what they want. And that's what Heart did on this disc and a few more after this. ",3.0
" This is a review of the 1990 Capitol CD version of this album. In short this is a very good album but the sound quality of the CD is mediocre at best and is in need of remastering. In fact the sound quality is very weak in comparison to the excellent remastered 'Little Queen' 'Dog & Butterfly' and 'Bebe Le Strange' CDs released by Epic/Legacy. Compared to my vinyl LP purchased back when the album was first released this CD sounds quite tinny with overdone highs and a great lack of midrange.As far as the music itself this is a solid effort and was Heart's biggest seller going 5X Platinum (per Wikipedia). It was a departure from the band's earlier albums as they went through a change in record label and with that came a new producer (Ron Nevison) new sound (heavier use of synth; less use of acoustic guitar) and new songwriters (emphasis on outsiders instead of the Wilson sisters). While I prefer the older albums this is still very good and worth a listen. In fact based on relative record sales most people prefer this version of Heart to their original approach.So overall 4 stars for the music 2 stars for the sound quality giving an overall rating of 3 stars.

" Being a huge Heart fan since the release of 'Dreamboat Annie' in 1976 I was not sure what to make of this 1985 self-titled album. While I was thrilled that the 'Heart' album was such a huge success I wondered what happend to my favorite band. They were no longer the folky blusey rockin band I grew up with - - now they were a huge hit machine with lots of pop/rock hits and huge hair. This album is however expertly executed. It accomplished its goal in spades - - turn Heart into a pop/rock hit making machine. All the songs here are good and Ann and Nancy and the band are in top form. Again proving they could play anything. However the soul is gone. ",3.0

" This is somewhat of a minority viewpoint in comparison to the previous five customer reviews already written. I read this book because of the local publicity it received here in Wisconsin the fact that I have been in Peru and in Amazon region (though not the same part as Dr. Linnea) am interested in Latin American culture and speak fluent Spanish.Dr. Linnea doesn't. The one complete Spanish sentence in the book contains a major grammar error that most students wouldn't make mid-way through their first semester of college Spanish. Of the isolated Spanish words she uses she gets a couple wrong. She can be forgiven for this. She obviously managed to communicate adequately with her patients and she's a physician after all not a linguist. I'm aware this seems like nitpicking and this is not my reason for a mere 3-star review.What I find lacking in this book is emotional engagement with the reader. I liked this book passably but wanted to like it so much more. Dr. Linnea is really the only character in it and she seems to be a rather private person. She gives us her opinions much more than her feelings. Maybe this is typical of the majority of physicians. We never really get to know her patients or any other person in the book. If she develops close relationships we don't learn of them. Some patients improve and survive some die but it's a bit like a catalogue of people who barely have names or faces and come through her office (or she goes to them). I'm also interested in medicine and geography in general and a book in a similar vein that of a doctor practicing 'backwoods medicine' that is truly wonderful (and that I'd hoped this one would resemble) is Dr. Abraham Verghese's MY OWN COUNTRY. (He treats AIDS patients in Appalachia in the mid-1980s.) Perhaps he's atypical in the way he becomes personally/emotionally involved with his patients or in the way that he is able to put human faces and lives on a disease and write about it all. Dr. Linnea in spite of being a wonderful person who has done dangerous extremely outstanding work is not able (or chooses not) to do what Verghese did in his book.Unlike another customer who reviewed this I definitely don't think this was ghost-written. Dr Linnea is right there revealing not one iota more than she wants to. I think the 'problem' can be seen right in her acknowledgements when regarding her publishers she writes that they 'gave me unlimited latitude in what I wanted to say and how I wanted to say it.' Sorry but this book needed much more editorial guidance. She's a physician not a professional writer and though this effort is quite passable it could have been so much better.The book is informative educational up to a point gives a good perspective on 'jungle' medicine' vs. the US mainstream practice thereof and is culturally sensitive. (Though at one point I winced when she said that the inhabitants almost all of whom live in abysmal poverty 'seemed happy.' This made me think of 19th century slaves in the US who many contended 'seemed happy.')

" I bought this case about 3 years ago when I graduated with my M.Arch degree. I keep it in a small pocket inside my purse which is rather protected and over time it has deteriorated. The pin that is in the hinge constantly slips out and I have to push it back in I find it difficult to open with such a small tab and the clear cover (acrylic?) has cracked in several places. I find it quite awkward to hand out cards at a moment's notice because I have to turn it just right in order to get a good grip to open it. Nice idea but I'll be sticking to something that lasts a bit longer and is easier and quicker to open. Let your business card tell people what you do - not your case. ",3.0

" David Remnick's 'Lenin's Tomb' is a book about the journalist's experiences just before and during the collapse of the USSR at the end of the 1980s. Using a chronological overview Remnick describes what the Soviet Union was like under the reign of Gorbachov (or 'Gorbachev' in US spelling) and his views on the various leaders journalists KGB officers bureaucrats dissidents and so on.Because Remnick goes almost entirely by interviews for his information the book gives a very thorough biographical view of the times but there is very little information on the general state of the country economic and social causes for the collapse and so on. Remnick's tone and style are very much like those of a tabloid investigative journalist describing people and events mostly by way of the author's opinions and what the people he interviews look and act like. This has the benefit of giving one the impression of re-living the interactions with the famous of those years but is far too shallow for any explanatory purpose.Additionally Remnick has too obvious favorites among the people involved. Gorbachov is generally shown more negatively than often in the West but that fits the overall negative appraisal given to him in Russia. But people like Yeltsin and Solzhenitsyn are praised endlessly and can practically do no wrong even though there are serious issues with both. Sakharov in particular is elevated literally to the level of a modern saint by Remnick",3.0

I spoke with an individual in customer support who stated the average probe lasts approximately one year then needs to be replaced(an error message comes up rendering the unit unusable).

" It seems that once a month we get a re-packaging of Little Richard's 1964-65 recordings. The latest but not greatest set of retreads is the above-named CD.The only selling point for Richard collectors in the uncommon mix on 'My Wheels They Are Slippin' All The Way' [aka 'My Wheel's Been Slippin''] the Country Rock number originally left on the shelf for ten years. The horn section is audible on this album opener. Track two 'It Ain't Whatcha Do' is the original flip-side of his third single for the label an under-produced dance floor offer and this reduced echo version is welcome.It's been said many times that Richard's work for this label is inconsistent but that doesn't mean that several sides aren't absolutely essential listening for *any* R & R fan or historian. There are a few masterpieces including the uptempo 'Dance What You Wanna' (co-written by Sam Cooke) and 'Talkin' ' bout Soul' (written by Sam's Manager and Richard's Manager-to-be J. W. Alexander). On the ballad side we have the monumental 'I Don't Know What You've Got But It's Got Me' the Don Covay composition recorded by LR in New York City May 1965 and including support by Jimi Hendrix (then known as Maurice James) Billy Preston and Don himself on harmony vocal.

This is why I recommend it only for die-hard fans. It is no help at all for the reader who has read only a couple of Heinlein's works. I think there should have been at least a basic plot synopsis for each item so those folks could have been pointed to Heinlein pieces that would have been new to them that they might have found interesting.No work not even Starship Troopers or Strangers in A Strange Land gets more than three or four pages of comments (most are less than a page) and the book is only about 250 pages long.

" 'Hum Saath-Saath Hain' is reminiscent of some of the other family-centered Hindi dramas of the 1990s such as 'Hum Aapke Hain Kaun' and it preceded the very popular 'Khabi Khushi Khabhie Gham' which deals with similar themes. These themes are family unity; obedience to parents; loyalty to siblings; and the potential for family erosion when doubt and suspicion creep in.The family at the core of this film is comprised of mother father and three sons who all live happily together and work for the prosperous family business (there's also a daughter but she's already married and therefore lives with her husband's family). The family functions according to a strict but loving hierarchy in which the eldest son Vivek (Mohnish Behl) marries first and is set to inherit the top position in the family firm; the second son Prem (Salman Khan) is sent abroad to study so that he can also join the company; and the youngest son Vinod (Saif Ali Khan) is mischievous but always looks up to his elder brothers.The first two hours of this three hour film are without any major family strife or drama - the focus is on the daily functioning of the family and the pairing off of each brother with his respective sweetheart. Vivek Prem and Vinod all get engaged in turn as the couples sing dance and bat their eyelashes at each other over the course of two hours. When Preeti bakes sweets for Prem (his favorite sweets of course!) that counts as high drama. If the intricacies of life in an extended family hold no interest for you then you will likely be bored to tears. If however you enjoy delicate flirtations and the visual feast that is Hindi cinema then it will be a pleasant two hours.The twist doesn't come until the final hour. When the daughter of the family experiences some difficulties in her husband's home the mother becomes paranoid that a similar schism will occur in her own family carefully balanced as it is between three brothers and their three wives-to-be. In a moment of doubt the mother causes the very schism she's afraid of but under the pretense of protecting her two younger sons from the power of the elder (who's also only their half-brother). I'm not giving away anything shocking when I say that all will be resolved in the end since the very foundation of this film is the idea that family bonds should never be broken and this family in particular is unbreakable.All of the actors turn in fine performances; surprisingly no one actor is the star over any other. Salman Khan plays the shy gentle brother and as such his performance is more subdued than usual. Mohnish Behl is great as the always-responsible noble elder brother and Saif Ali Khan is credible as the playful responsibility-dodging youngest brother. The three women (Tabu Sonali Bendre and Karishma Kapoor) are lovely but they don't have much scope for nuance in their roles; they are all dutiful loving women who act appropriately and obediently. Not much room for drama in such idealized characterizations.In summary",3.0

" This guy is almost cut like Schwarzenegger but has no sense of humor. Decent action like some of Arnold's early works (e.g. Commando and Red Heat) but not the best acting just like them. If you got a couple hours to blow and want to see a new action movie this will fit the bill. I suggest rental as this does not have alot of replayability in my book. Even my two young stepsons that were Marines weren't impressed. A good popcorn no brainer action movie. If you own any of Schwarzenegger's movies your time would be better spent watching them again. Don't get me wrong I really hope that Cena's career in movies will continue. With time I'm sure his acting will improve as Schwartzenegger's did. Let's face it the movie had potential if the acting was better or they threw in more comedy. About the only funny thing in the movie was when one of the bad guys says 'He's like the Terminator' when talking about the Marine and then Robert Patrick who played a Terminator in 'Terminator 2' gives a steely glance at him. If this turns out to be the only movie Cena makes I have to vote for 'Chill Factor' with Skeet Ulrich or 'Firestorm' with Howie Long over this one. If they had added in more humor I think it would have worked better.Story Synopsis",3.0

" The Marine is a film about a marine that has just been discharged and is back home with his wife. When she's kidnapped by the bad guys the game is on. It's an action movie and I think most people can spot what this movie is going to be like from that description. So if you're not a person that enjoys action movies like Rambo or Commando then I can safely say that you won't enjoy this film. It's still a paint-by-numbers affair so it's doubtful you'd suddenly find yourself enjoying this type of film.But I am someone who enjoys action movies like Rambo and Commando. So I waited till I found myself in the right mood to watch an action romp and I stuck this DVD in. The movie starts out with some promise. After John Cena's character is discharged from the military he takes a job as a security guard. The scene that followed that was fairly entertaining - with Cena throwing around his weight. While that scene is entertaining it is also meant to show that Cena's character is miserable outside of marine life. This hints at some inner turmoil that is then left behind completely and never again brought up in the film.Robert Patrick does a great job as the bad guy. I thought he was very good. I did not care for his henchmen as they didn't seem to bring anything to the table. Likewise John Cena is not an actor. He doesn't need to be in an action movie if the plot is compelling but it's really not. There aren't any memorable action scenes that stick out in my mind as I reflect back so all I am recalling is the awkward delivery that John Cena had. I also didn't care for his character's wife; who was very attractive but had a quality about her that said there was nothing going on upstairs. The pair is not a couple who are developed characters; the wife especially comes off as an arrogant shrew and so as a viewer I'm not invested in the film when she is kidnapped.All in all this movie would have been a better film as a focus on Robert Patrick's jewelery store heist and escape. That was much more interesting than The Marine and his walk through a swamp. But that's just my opinion.sincerelyR.C. ",3.0
" The storyline is good but developing the characters of the 'bad guys' was quite pathetic. No depth no brains just blow up things at random and find things to bicker and whine about... Especially trying to bring racism into the fray... lets blame the senseless violence on the 'black guy'. The character happened to be a black guy and had a penchant for self-destruction... and blowing everything else up as well. I personally found that little whining episode offensive no matter how you chose to interpret it.The character development of John Triton was pretty good but established him as more of a loose cannon rather than a highly skilled combat individual. This is further reinforced when he gets into fights and essentially uses his face to block many of the punches. That may work in the WWE but does not establish a character who is supposed to be highly skilled in hand/hand combat.Some of the scenes in the movie seemed to be filler to get minutes. Especially his encounter with the two poachers while running through the swamp.However the movie still managed to be fun to watch once I was able to adjust my expectations for the movie to be WWE entertainment and not as a full action movie.Overall you can enjoy this movie if you choose to it isn't a total loss but neither is it a winner.

" What a surprise. This film contains outstanding dialog. It's pretty funny. It does get boring later in the film perhaps there's a lack of content or grounding and the outstanding dialog seems to become average. The film makers seem to understand our boredom and presto change-o many car crashes and explosions. Their trickery seems to work.I will say this film does nothing for race relations. Especially if you take the film makers seriously. The black villain in the story is such a stereo-type of the bad guy obsessed with getting in touch with his blackness. Arch-type - that's what he is. Not a stereotype but a stand in for all African Americans or rather the personification of a certain ideology. Perhaps just a reality. This may be done intentionally that's my opinion. He's not shown to be a reliable character in the film. Just be a person not a Black man. Perhaps just avoid black men if possible. . . ? Building understanding. . . perhaps - but this film does nothing to improve race relations. Who said the Marines are about better race relations? At least we'd like to imagine they aren't. ",3.0

" Some might say that professional wrestlers are already actors to some extent. WWE Studios is dedicated to expanding the careers of those with acting talent from the ring to the big screen. As a champion John Cena brought an imposing physical presence rugged good looks and a certain flair for the dramatic to his wrestling and music endeavors. The Marine (2006) is a vehicle designed to showcase Cena's talents and he acquits himself well enough in his big screen debut an explosive and exciting but still rather unremarkable action thriller.Cena is ex-Marine John Triton discharged from the service for disobeying orders while on a mission in Iraq. Returning stateside Triton finds civilian life a little rough and decides to get away from it all for a while heading into the South Carolina mountains with his wife Kate (Kelly Carlson Nip/Tuck).At a roadside gas station a gang of thieves on the run ambush a couple of highway patrolmen. With their vehicle damaged the criminals led by Rome (Robert Patrick) and his lieutenant Angela (Abigail Bianca) slug John kidnap Kate and hit the road in Triton's SUV. Triton gives chase in the patrol car in what is the action highlight of the first half of the film. The gang is left travelling on foot through the swamp with Triton on their trail. The group make their way to a safe house. Triton arrives and takes out some of the gang but Rome sets off and explosion and makes his escape. Triton again has to dodge a fireball and after borrowing a police speedboat finally catches up to Rome. Up until the finish Cena's fight scenes are fairly routine but the battle between Cena and Patrick finally generates a few sparks.Although the story is rather simplistic and uncomplicated The Marine does entertain and provides the requisite opportunities for John Cena to flex his muscles and exercise his fledgling acting skills. Robert Patrick (The Unit Terminator 2) is a known talent and brings some humor and class to the production and he has enough physical stature to take on Cena. Kelly Carlson (who should be in more films) and Australian Abigail Bianca mix it up in a couple of spirited fights.Working with director Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger Die Hard 2) the acting potential that is shown here is more fully realized in Cena's next film 12 Rounds (2009). Though he is still chasing after a girl Cena's character is more well rounded and the film features more of Cena doing his thing behind the wheel of a vehicle. ",3.0

" The Marine is about a marine (John Cena) who is kicked out due to not following orders well. He then gets fired from his security job after man handling a jerk. He then stresses to his friend that 'being a marine is what he did best'. Then on a trip with his wife she's taken hostage by jewel thieves. They carry big guns and blow stuff up but while acting like the kind of baffoons you'd see in a Home Alone movie. Robert Patrick is cool as the leader of the bad guys but he gets so many goofy lines that it's hard to take him seriously. I think he's a wasted actor. I mean his performance in Walk the Line and other serious roles show that. Plus no he did not kill the X-Files like many fans say. The show trying to continue without Mulder killed the X-Files. He was pretty good in it.Anyway this movie doesn't know if it's an action thriller or action comedy. Plus I don't know why people praise the stunts. It's like wannabe Transporter or Transporter 2 type action. Plus with so many huge explosions you'd think that at least one person would die in them. But John Cena escapes every huge explosion without a mark on him.We also have seen how many movies where the heroe takes one bad guy at a time as one after another goes looking for him one after another. It worked a lot better for Die Hrad than it does for this film though. Now the good about the movie. It offers sexy women and although I'm not the biggest John Cena fan I can't say he's a bad action star. He has the right look even if he does basically give a one note performance. He's a marine and he makes sure we think of him as nothing but a marine. The script also makes sure we just think of him as nothing but a dangerous marine that loves his wife too. Since that's all we ever learn about him. It's just a fast paced brainless action film so it doesn't need any character build-up. ",3.0

" This film promised lots of action. It delivered. The numerous explosions made a great spectacle. Commercial director John Bonito helmed his first feature. He keeps the pacing going well. I had no clue who John Cena was and wondered how he grabbed an action lead. After seeing the DVD extras of his wrestling career I understand how he was cast and remembered him from channel surfing. His reactions are fairly wooden without many levels that we'd expect from a more experienced actor. But he gets an 'A' for effort and completed many of his own stunts.Robert Patrick who was the bad guy in 'Terminator 2",3.0
" In the Marine John Cena plays a discharged marine who tracks down the jewel thieves that kidnapped his wife. It draws inevitable comparisons to Commando Die Hard and countless other action flics - and it doesn't shy away from that. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously and throws in knowing references to other 'blow-em up' films [including a Terminator line for the sake of lead baddie Robert Patrick]. There's nothing new or really eye popping to see here. It is a formula driven testerone fest that does all the usual things that movies like this are supposed to do and it is all pulled off fairly well. Don't go into it expecting Bourne-like intrigue; however don't be surprised if you find yourself thinking how much John Cena looks like Bourne actor Matt Damon from the neck up. If there were a Bourne spoof Cena would be a no-brainer to play the title character. ",3.0

" This is rather fun to watch although it is completely over the top in being unrealistic.Although most action shows tend to be extreme in the situations that the star survives and thrives in this one puts virtually all others to shame in that regard. That is unfortunate as it is a storyline that could have proven to be a great movie if it were written better.It features John Triton (John Cena) as a former Marine who was kicked out of the Corps for disobeying an order. Of course had he obeyed the order many American lives would have been lost. Nevertheless he was scapegoated and discharged.One day he and his wife Kate (Kelly Carlson) are at a convenience store when a group of thugs kills a cop. They then take Kate hostage which proves to be a very poor decision for them as John is a commando the makes Rambo look like a wimp in comparison. The bad guys are about to have a very bad day indeed.This really could have been a great show but there are way too many extreme fires/explosions that get Triton. If the writers would have toned that part down just a bit this might have been a four or even a five star show. Hardcore actions fans will probably enjoy it but it comes off as a bit too hokey for many others. ",3.0
" John Cena was very realisitic made the part genuine and intriguing. He really portrayed a man going out of his mind with anger at his wife being kidnapped. At the same time he was clever and covert. It is unfortunate that with his talent and great looks he was given a substandard plot. He has untapped skills and a charisma that could make him a tremendous movie star in a story that is unique and capitalizes on his expertise. ",3.0
" The special effects were great and the production is pretty darn good. By the end of the movie you realize the hero should've died a long time ago but then again that's what action movies are all about. Near the end he takes a sledgehammer to the gut which would've pretty much put most people out of commission. He's nearly blown up 3 times lives through a car chase where the car ends up being swiss cheese torn to pieces. The acting wasn't too bad but they tried to put humor in that I think only a WWE fan would appreciate. There was one funny moment I liked that referenced Terminator. It's a decent action movie if you just put logic aside and enjoy the ride. I'm not a wrestling fan so most of actors were unknown to me. It's worth a rent just for the car chase. ",3.0
" I was a little disappointed in this book. I had expected something original and different. It seemed to be a summary of books I had already read.

" Having suffered the derision of fellow sci-fi fans for many years I recently picked up the Foundation Trilogy for the first time; I was actually pretty disappointed by my first exposure to Asimov's longer works. Obviously the man is one of the renowned masters of science fiction because he got there first",3.0
" Foundation came to me highly recommended. I am not new to science fiction but I have not read that much of this genre. I was looking forward to something that would really blow my mind away. though I admired several things about the book and thought it was a nice read I am not going to read the other books in this series. Coming away from this book I felt it was good but not much more. There were several ways in which I clearly found the book to be lacking. Though Asimov's style is surely concise and highly readable he views plot as the central element to his writing at the expense of other aspects of great fiction that really should have been incorporated. I will outline these at length because it appears that the book's praises are already sung widely.First there is not much character development. Characters are presented merely to accomplish a historical event in the flow of the story. We get a feel for the characters not as real people but as actors on the stage of world history. Though the reader admires the nerve and intellect behind each of these heroes there is little else that makes them interesting. While this kind of presentation of characters may work in movie adaptations or history textbooks I like to view my characters as a little more than men at work. Everybody is always scheming there's not much downtime or description of what day-to-day life is like with these guys so far in the future such far-off planets.Secondly there is a lack of real meaning or symbolism that defines great books. The closest we get to intrinsic meaning is the description of the false religion that Salvor Hardin invents. And this only helps us understand what the author probably thinks about organized religion. The all-importance of nuclear energy also seems like propaganda to get ther reader to 'understand' how important it will be in our era with no attention paid to other kinds of fascinating technology that may exist in the future such as super-intellect robotics biotechnology etc. I don't know if Asimov was just lacking in creativity because with the exception of his brilliant description of the mother planet Trantor the only thing different between this far off future and nowadays is the ability to jump through space.Thirdly romance does not play a role in the book. There no women in the book which means there can be no romantic intrigue or world events influenced by a woman. Also there is no sense of wonder and excitement that a reader surely hopes to get when they enter an author's imagination. The landscape of these far off worlds is sparesely and hardly described. We spend much of our time in staterooms.On the other hand if you like books that are centered on brilliant leaders of nation-states and how their decisions affect the course of history you will like this book. If you are fascinated by the economic political and sociological macroforces that shape history you will like this book. If you're more about the game than the players you will like this book. ",3.0
" The main reason I read sci-fi is to visualize strange new worlds and places. Although a good book I didn't really get a good mental picture of the different worlds involved in it except Trantor in the very beginning of the book. It was mostly about people and politics with very little of the landscapes they lived in. I guess that is why I liked the Dune and Hyperion series so much. ",3.0
" Being a science fiction fan for some years I picked up a copy of Foundation after hearing wonderful things about this series and loving I Robot. On the whole I think I Robot is a better read largely because I got to know and empathize with the characters in that set of stories more which is my main criticism of this book.Nevertheless Foundation is still very worthwhile and while I wouldn't recommend this book to everyone there are certain friends who I think would love it - it's for a select audience who loves science fiction and/or Isaac Asimov. I am going to continue on with the series - and we'll see how it goes! ",3.0
" The key to enjoying the original Foundation trilogy is to understand that the three novels which make up the 'trilogy' are not really novels. They are a series of interconnected stories written over time. Foundation is actually 5 short stories. Because of this the stories vary in quality.The second book Foundation and Empire is actually two stories. The first is called The General and tells the story of the empire's last ditch effort to conquer the foundation. The weakness of the first story is that all the action takes place off page. We never see any of the actual combat we just read the characters talking about it. Also the resolution comes way too quickly. It feels like Asimov had reached his page limit and decided to end the story as quickly as he could.The second story called The Mule is the real draw here. All the previous stories presented a challege for the foundation to overcome. However it was always expected that the foundation would triumph based on the long term scientific predictions of its founder. The Mule throws in a variable that was not predicted. The appearance of a mutant who swiftly moves to conquer the various planets left in the wake of the old empire's collapse. Ultimately he sets his sights on the foundation. The best part of the story is a visit to the ruins of the planet Trantor. Former capital of the galactic empire.Having finished this second book I have come to realize that the Foundation trilogy while entertaining is certainly not Asimov's best work. Time is not always kind to science fiction and all of these early stories were written before 1950 when Asimov was still a young writer. I plan to continue on to the next book but I no longer expect to be overwhelmed by the classic status these stories have achieved. ",3.0
" I like Foundation because it's a solid piece of sci-fi from olden days. (George Lucas's stealing of Asimov's city-planet for his Coruscant - tsk tsk Georgie - amazed me most.) Foundation does have peculiarities. People hundreds of thousands of years in the future speak like us. They use phrases like us. They also have the same atomic technology as people did in the 1950s. Asimov got a bit lazy here; he could've imagined something cooler than nukes. The galaxy is a metaphor for a crumbling Roman empire. Perhaps Terminus is Ireland. As for A's style I found his use of long adverbs rather funny. In sum a good book if you can ignore this stuff. ",3.0
" I know I'll take some major heat in saying this but I wasn't that impressed with this beloved classic. Oh the idea intrigues me surely that of humankind eons in the future existing across the galaxy on a multitude of worlds so far removed from earth that eminent masters of science themselves debate whether earth was even the planet where human life began but once the dust settled from an idea that lofty what did Asimov really DO with it? He used it for unexciting little tales of science v. military might. I love the parallel between the fall of this vast space empire and the fall of Rome. The way bands of scientists struggled in a dark age to keep the light of knowledge alive was thought-provoking (which is high praise in my lexicon) but this was backdrop and the plot Asimov employed in telling the story of all this was (sorry to say) dull slow simple and unworthy of the imaginative concepts he thought up in his setting for this tale of knowledge overcoming strength of arms. I haven't read the later Foundation novels so maybe they're the ones where the brilliance of the series exists but I found this book from Sci-Fi's golden age so demanding on my patience that I didn't finish it the first time I tried to read it and barely made it to the end the second time. I wish I shared the glowing praise for this classic that millions of others claim they feel but to be honest I just don't. ",3.0
" Re-reading Foundation showed it to be rather dated in its depiction of an advanced galactic empire rooted in its 1940s science fiction environment. The overall plot such as it is betrays the novel's origins as separate short stories and the characters tend to be wooden. Foundation and Empire the next book in Asimov's original Foundation trilogy is a much better novel especially in its depiction of the character of the Mule. However the concept of psychohistory introduced in this work is fascinating and the key to the other books by Asimov and others describing past and future developments in the Foundation universe.

" The second of the first Foundation trilogy Foundation and Empire was originally published in 1952. Originally published as two novellas in Astounding Science Fiction 'The General' and 'The Mule' cover the next two periods when the Foundation receives its first full-force attacks.In 'The General' the Galactic Empire is well on its way to its inevitable end but under the command of General Bel Riose an attack is planned against the Foundation. Bel Riose has gone mad with power and will stop at nothing to obliterate the Foundation somehow believing they are behind the fall of the empire. He amounts huge forces if armored gunships with plans wipe the Foundation from the galaxy. But one man from the Foundation knows about this and he also knows knowledge is power and since the Foundation is soon as that which has all the knowledge he knows Bel Riose can be stopped so long as he gets to the Emperor before the general attacks.In 'The Mule' the Galactic Empire has fallen into a selection of barbaric kingdoms while the Foundation has become strong and powerful but also full of corruption composed of approximately thirty outer planets. But there is corruption within the ranks and things are stirring within the Foundation's empire. Meanwhile there is a new leader who has rise an enigmatic mutant known as 'The Mule' who has only known scorn and suffering and is a hardened creature who respects no one but he also has the ability to read and control people's emotions. It is up to two Foundation citizens Toran and Bayta Darell along with the Foundation's only psychologist Ebling Mis and a strange refugee clown 'Magnifico Giganticus' to search for the Second Foundation set up by Hari Seldon originally when the Foundation was created and stop this 'Mule.'Originally written on February 5 2011 Alex C.

" Isaac Asimov was one of the greatest science fiction minds of the twentieth century. He was NOT however a great writer. At times it is difficult to separate the brilliance and scope of his imaginative ideas from the pedestrian and awkward manner in which he presents them.'Foundation' the first novel in the ever-lengthening Foundation series is a collection of short stories originally published in 'Astounding' magazine. The first couple are very good but the last few are pretty uninteresting. The writing is uneven dialogue is unrealistic and characters are wooden and one-dimensional. And yet through Asimov's wonderfully creative idea of psychohistory and its use in saving a dying Galactic Empire this series became one of the best science fiction stories of all time and well worth reading.Do be careful which edition you read. I read the Del Ray paperback edition and I have never seen so many typographical errors in a published book. ",3.0

" Let's face it",3.0
" That's not saying much since I thought that 'Foundation' was pretty poor.'Foundation and Empire' was pretty good but still lacked in certainareas - mainly character development and also the first third of thebook had a very weak story line. The whole battle with the Empire bythe Foundation was very very weak I cannot stress that enough. Maybe Iwas just hoping for an epic battle between the renegade Foundation andthe dying Empire. Nothing really happened to spur the victory of theFoundation there wasn't even really a battle. But I guess that mightbe the point that Asimov was making since Seldon predicted the choicesand decisions of the Emperor about the passion that the characters hadfor the battle. It wasn't even a battle between the Empire it was somemission designed and orchestrated by some general in the navy thatthought it would be a good idea to take over the Foundation.This book also lacked in strong characterizations but not as much asthe first 'Foundation' by a long shot. The last two thirds of the bookstick with the same characters the whole time. It also enters apowerful mutant the Mule. I won't give much away about the Mule andhis plans because I don't want to spoil the book but it sets up for thesequel 'Second Foundation.' Once again the idea of the Mule is a goodidea but is somewhat poorly executed until the ened when everything isexplained about the effects the Mule has on the Foundation and thepeople in the main storyline.Get ready for 'Second Foundation' because it will probably be the bestof the first trilogy. This book is worth reading and if 'SecondFoundation' is better than this book then I will recommend the'Foundation Series' to anybody who can persist in their reading anddoesn't mind a long slow beginning.

" How can this be considered a classic? It's fun it's entertaining but it lacks so much qualities all classics have!The Mule was a disappointment. I knew from the beggining who he was. I found myself skimming sections of this novel because I got bored with it. When I got to page 50 I was ready to give up on the novel and put it down but I thought this book has to be good it's consider a classsic! So I decided to read the whole novel.

" After reading Prelude (which I thoroughly enjoyed) I began FOUNDATION with much anticipation. Unfortunately the book did not meet my expectations. First it was really boring and predictable. Second you never stay with a scenario long enough for any character development. As soon as the reader gets to know one of the characters Asimov rushes ahead 50 years and a new cast of characters enters. My final complaint about FOUNDATION is that most of the characters are presented as simple minded. I might read the rest of the books in this series only because I have been told they get better.

" While I believe that Asimov was a great science fiction author I was disappointed in this book and the whole series. To me science fiction is about new ideas of the future and an exciting story. While the idea of a falling society where some foresee the downfall of its society and plan to minimise the impact is interesting it could have been staged as well in the past. One can tell that the book has been written some while ago and it is missing the action and technologies I want to read about in a science fiction book today. For me personally the book is also very slow paced and not engaging enough to make me want to continue reading it but rather read some chapters at a time and then I can put it down for weeks since I am not engaged enough to read further. Still I am kind of interested in how the series continues and finally ends but not interested enough that I have to use every free minute reading it. I find it hard to judge this book and if you are into science fiction I believe you just have to give it a try. Yes I rated it only three stars but rating this book in a one dimensional fashion doesn't do its justice since I believe it is still a very good book but just not what I was expecting of a science fiction and wanted to read.

" I was expecting so much more from this book as it was once awarded best sci-fi series ever. It was good but not that great. Maybe in the 1950's it was the best of sci-fi but compared to today's standards it was a little boring and out of date. It contains long dialogs and a lot of politics wrapped in a sci-fi environment. It doesn't contain fascinating worlds and interesting glimpses of the future. There's not a lot of action but I have to admit the dialog is pretty good.

" From everything I've heard about this book I was really excited to read it. After reading the first half in a few days then forcing myself to finish the second half after taking a two week break I can honestly say that I found it to be a real let down.The main theme was about the only part I liked. Humanity has colonized the stars and controls everything blah blah blah but a really smart guy and his friends do some math equations and figure out that the currently all-powerful and all-encompassing Empire is doomed to collapse and thrust mankind thousands of years back to a 'barbaric' state. His solution is to gather all the great minds of the day and create an educated stronghold on the edge of the galaxy to serve as a becon of hope and enlightnenment to supposedly shorten the time mankind has to spend in the dark ages.Their main goal is to create an encyclopedia that pretty much contains every biit of information ever learned. Ever. (wikipedia)Well it turns turns out that several years after the creation of Foundation the shallow characters are riddeled with 'crises'. Good thing the late creator appears via prerecorded videos at strategic times to offer advice to the indistinguishable residents and assures them that he did some math problems fifty years ago and discovered that everyting with work itself out. This is the basis for the rest of the book.The characters are dull boring and super confident in everything they do because some dead guys math and future predictions will save them all.The second half of the book proved to be slightly more interesting but not much ",3.0
" The first thing to understand about Foundation is that it isn't really a novel. It is a collection of 5 connected short stories (The Psychohistorians The Encyclopedists The Mayors The Traders & The Merchant Princes) written in the 1940s for publication in Astounding Science Fiction Magazine. The first story in the book was actually written a few years later for repackaging the stories as the first novel in what would eventually become the Foundation trilogy (later expanded with additional books).The galactic empire is rotting. After it collapses there will follow 30000 years of barbarism. Nothing can prevent the collapse but Hari Seldon believes that the subsequent dark ages can be contained to 1000 years if the proper steps are taken. To achieve this he sets up the Foundation at the very fringes of the empire. The first two stories are far and away the best in the book and are worth the price of admission by themselves. This is because they deal directly with the central premise which is a fantastic idea.Things go downhill with the next two stories. In particular The Traders seems completely unnecessary. Things pick up a bit with the final chapter.Taken as a whole Foundation is less than the sum of its parts. I don't think it is the unrivaled masterpiece that many make it out to be. I would definitely go in with an open mind and lowered expectations.However as I mentioned earlier the idea is fantastic and promises much more and better to come. I will definitely be checking out the next book in the series. ",3.0

" I recently re-read this classic work of science fiction and was pleasantly surprised to find it's still relevant today. The characters and language are a bit creaky but the social issues Asimov raises are sound. Under what conditions is it ethical for a self-appointed academic elite to hoodwink and trick the general population for their own good? Phrased that way the answer seems obvious -- under no conditions at all? -- but what if it really IS for their own good and if disaster is the alternative?We don't have any better answers to those questions today than we did 70 years ago when Asimov was writing.

" When a book is slated as one of the greatest Sci-Fi novels of our time it should be extremely hard to criticize. Unfortunately I found The Foundation to have more than a few flaws which actually made it a chore to read. Considering that it beat out 'The Lord of the Rings' for the Hugo Award in 1965 for best All-Time Series which is why I decided read it makes it even more insufferable in my opinion. Simply look at how momentous LOTR's has become over The Foundation in our culture and you can begin to see how it is obviously lacking something. So why does it fall short ? Well the primary reason is the story line jumps vast amounts of time chapter to chapter which even though I found refreshing it gives the reader a completely new set of characters in different settings which receive little to no development. So ultimately the visual depth as well as character depth which I find so alluring about Sci-Fi is ultimately lacking leaving little for the imagination to grasp on to. What this does do though is leave room for what I believe Asimov wanted the reader to really experience which is the psychohistorical themes built upon long term economic strategy which was wonderfully orchestrated and second to none. The thing that gets me is considering that is the focus of the story it could have just as easily taken place in the 1800's and 1900's and be based on oil or guns instead of nuclear power. Don't get me wrong the story is intriguing but if you are looking for a visually stimulating Sci-Fi book I would look elsewhere...or you can just wait for the feature film in 2013. ",3.0

" This may be a classic and I may be a science fiction fan but read Asimov's 'The Gods Themselves' instead of this. His later work is definitely better. 'Foundation and Empire' is like its predecessor ('Foundation') in that you get several stories told in different periods throughout Foundation history. Everything Asimov has come up with in these books is fundamentally good sci-fi story stuff but the lack of character development makes you think while you're reading 'Why am I reading this?'

As an avid reader of the genre I felt implied to give the series a whirl to see what all the fuss is about and to finally spend some time with one of the grand-daddies of the golden age. So I bought 'Foundation' along with the other two novels in the original trilogy and away I went.Very boring. Very dry. Very forgettable. The problem here I think is that while Asimov had some very fantastic ideas floating around in that pioneering noggin of his he was not exactly the best at nurturing them into full-form on the page. Thus we have a series of novels that read much more like outlines of a stronger and more fleshed-out epic. The setting is grand the characters are intriguing. The plot is one for the ages. The final product however does little justice to these ideas and I found that to be vastly disappointing. All throughout I wanted more. I wanted more world-building - not necessarily technobabble and meandering Dickenson discription but at least more insight into the nature of this vast civilization apparently on the brink of collapse. Very much the same with the characters - I wanted to sympathize with Hari Seldon as he worked to keep knowledge alive in the face of ignorance but it was so hard to do so when he was presented as little more than a piece of animated cardboard. I was thinking constantly about what could have been and that put a damper on the overall effect.I think the ideas and character tropes Asimov put forth in his trilogy have been worked with by other authors and brought to life far more successfully in the years since its initial release. Novels that come to mind are Dan Simmons's awe-inspiring 'Hyperion' series and Neal Stephenson's bulky 'Anathem'. In these books great ideas are coupled with great writing. The results as much as it hurts me to say it put Asimov's original to shame.'Foundation' is a great series to read if you want to witness science fiction as it was in its infantile and supposedly-golden age. But I think that it#s nevertheless important to understand that pioneering ideas can further develop and be presented in far-superior ways as the years progress. Such is the case here. Imaginative but slow and dated. Should most certainly remain in print and continue to be read but I do not think it is the gold-standard classic it has been made out to be. Others have done much better. ",3.0
" I used to be a big fan. Somehow the first season wasn't what I remembered. Still John Ritter saved it all. I still am buying season 2. ",3.0
" I was reluctant to buy this disc because of its high price/few episodes ratio. (Come on 'All in the Family' gets 26 episodes for $30 that's under $1 per episode and that's how it should be for all TV!) However as a proceed of the purchase (how much they won't tell us hmmmm...) goes to a charity John Ritter adored I broke down tonight and bought it.After the ubiquitous FBI screen disappears I was greeted with a menu. Ignore the naysayers there is nothing wrong with how this menu works and I've used far far worse in my 300 movie collection. I rather like the menu... And the fact they have a menu option telling us of the Spring 2004 release for season 2 made my day it's nice to see they'll put out this series for the fans.Now for the transfer. Audio quality is superb well restored. Video quality is a different story. Upon freeze-framing it's very clear that despite doing a good job at restoring the master tapes they did a rather poor transfering the video to DVD. (You HDTV fans out there may not like watching this on your sets... and by 1996 the FCC is pulling the plug on current broadcast standards...) I can think of 2 reasons why the video looks as poor as it does but it suffices to say that the end result is a video image that looks needlessly grainy; broadcast video technology of the time never ever looked this bad. But while not as bad as VHS consumer quality videotape it is well below acceptable DVD quality. (for another example of what not to do in terms of transfrring video quality onto DVD check out the dithering used in 'The Best of the Chris Rock Show' - yuck!) But given the price of this disc and that 'All in the Family' costs less per episode and yet looks far better (despite NOT having had its master tapes restored) I'm knocking 2 points off. DVD video should not ever look this grainy in a freeze-frame. (it is bearable when things in motion but be prepared for a shock if you're a 'quality freak'.)6 episodes. I was pondering the same issue why not have a season 1 + 2 box set? But then we'd have to wait until spring and I hate waiting though I would have if the video looked better. Besides these episodes are HILARIOUS. The gags the double entendres the Ropers... it's all there. And when you are laughing so much you start to cry and get a stomachache you know you're watching a winner of a show that's well written and well cast. No wonder 'Three's Company' became a success so quickly. As other reviewers here and other websites post plot synopses and reviews I won't here. (well 'No Dogs No Children' was probably my favorite of the bunch especially the scene where Chrissy and Jack are in the kitchen feeding the puppy...)And the real downfall is John Ritter died an untimely death. ",3.0
" Three's Company is about as overrated as a TV show can get. First of all every single episode is about the same. How many episodes can be written on a simple misunderstanding? John Ritter was talented but this show caused him to be castwritten for the rest of his life. The guy acted gay just a little 'too' well if you ask me. The best you can say about this show is that Suzanne Somers used to jump around and jiggle without a bra.Don't be fooled by the cover. Joyce DeWitt did not look this hot until much later in the show. For now she still has the dippy-doo haircut and has the sex appeal of a cactus. The producers of the show didn't make her sexy until Suzanne left.'Larry' the used car salesman upstairs may have played a ladie's man but he was just plain scary like a werewolf. When was that hairstyle ever popular? His eyebrows seemed to reach out and grab people. The guy was as hairy as a rug too. Just looking at his arms you couldn't tell what race he was.Well John died recently while making a show with the sexiest woman on television Katey Sagal. People are saying this DVD release is a tribute to John. Poo poo I say. If Three's Company needed a much needed tribute it was to the great Norman Fell aka Mr. Roper. He was funnier than four John Ritters. I mean c'mon he had lines like 'Hey it's easy to find my wife on a nude beach she's the one that looks like her socks are rolled down!' Now that is humor my friends. So if you must buy this DVD buy it for an overlooked comedian the late great Norman Fell. ",3.0
" I expected so much from Townsend after reading a few of his other stories. However there is less bdsm content than I expected and more political/social commentary. Not a bad thing if one is more aware of the politics and social environment of the gay community in the 1970s but hard to follow and identify with otherwise. I had difficulty empathizing with any of the characters -- perhaps part of that lies with the fact that there are so many characters in the story. However there are several hot scenes in the book and therefore it may be worth the time and money to purchase the book. ",3.0

" I found this to be one of the better books I've seen about setting up shop. It showcases plenty of example shops and has some handy advise. However like most books on this topic it tries to cover all the possibilites - building a separate shop working in a shed basement attic etc. and pertinent information for any one case is thus sparse. I'd like to see books specifically for conversion of a basement space or shed etc. into a shop but I guess that would only add limitations on readership from a writer/publisher perspective. ",3.0

How do they arrange their workbenches in relation to their tool boxes how do they store their clamps how do they store their wood etc.Overall I think Taunton Press's 'The Workshop Book' is a better resource for these kinds of ideas.

" Who wouldn't watch a movie that had Mel Gibson wearing obscenely tight leather trousers and looking scarily young?Before The Passion was brought to the attention of film buffs and the press there was Lethal Weapon. And before that Mel Gibson made his name in the Mad Max movies.There's nothing on the DVD I got for my birthday not even a trailer. And I hate watching DVDs with no trailers. I'm fussy me. So I wasn't sure what to expect or what the film was exactly about. All I knew was that my mum couldn't wait to watch it and was drooling (along with me) when Mel Gibson appeared shirtless.Before the amount of money that was spent in the car chase along a freeway in Matrix Reloaded there was this. A simple but still effective car chase which introduces you very briefly to Max. I don't see the point in spending loads of money when all you need is a bunch of cars that can be trashed and a camera.Then you get to see that Max has a pretty young wife and a young child. You can almost see how the rest of the movie pans out after that. It's pretty obvious he's not mad until something really traumatic happens. I was expecting the whole growling throwing stuff but instead he seemed relatively calm - except for the sweat on his face.It's NOT obvious that this movie could get another two sequels out of it. Maybe one sequel but two? And the latter featuring Tina Turner of all people. And there's rumoured to be a fourth along with a fourth Die Hard and god knows what else. Something tells me Mel Gibson won't fit into those trousers!If you think this is going to be a movie based on revenge you're wrong. The revenge part doesn't start until about half an hour before the end.It will be interesting to see the sequels. To be honest this film did nothing for me - unless you count the tight trousers! Very easy on the eyes if you know what I mean. ",3.0
" This is an excellent example of Mel Gibson's fine acting work. If you haven't seen it but have seen Beyond Thunderdome give it a viewing.

" So let me set the record straight about this version of the movie from Amazon's Instant Video. It is the original Aussie soundtrack not an English dubbed version. Between all the different DVDs and downloads if you are interested in downloading this one be assured that it is not dubbed. It is however pan and scan.

" I'm really not sure why but this is my least favorite in the Mad Max trilogy. It's not nearly as awesome as the Road Warrior or fun as Beyond Thunderdome. Either way it's worth watching simply because it sets the scene for Road Warrior one of the greatest movies of all time. ",3.0
" In 1981 THE ROAD WARRIOR was released in to the United States and became an instant hit but George Miller's story of angry cop Max begins with his 1979 classic MAD MAX.Mel Gibson plays the title character 'Mad' Max Rockatansky a cop in a postapocalyptic future (when exactly isn't specified). He's the best cop around patroling the highways for speed-hungry gang members. Well after his best friend is killed and Max steps in the gang gets a little mad. In the end Max (now gone a little beyond Mad) sets out to avenge the death of his wife and infant child both killed by the gang.MAD MAX is a sci-fi classic that spawned one of the best-loved sci-fi series of all-time. Miller's directing style brings the needed impact to the seemingly dead futuristic earth. Gibson is also good in his star-making role (look at how young he is...wow!) - plus Brian May (not the Queen Brian May) contributes a good score.Top-notch sci-fi action entertainment and one of the greatest (and funnest) films to come out of Australia. Followed by MAD MAX 2 (THE ROAD WARRIOR) and MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME. ",3.0
" In a post-apocalyptic Australia Max (Mel Gibson) and his fellow officers try to keep order on the highways as nihilistic biker gangs grow ever bolder. We are given the definite impression that the final bastions of civilization are on their last legs as chaos encroaches.This film presents intriguing characters and a suitably bleak scenario. It starts strong but it loses its energy before the end. Perhaps I was spoiled by seeing the classic action sequel 'The Road Warrior' first. When Max goes mad at the end of this first film director George Miller doesn't set the action sequences up very well or provide much of a payoff. The most exciting set pieces actually come much earlier in the movie. However his next film will prove that he can be a master of action. ",3.0
" This film is the prequel to the amazingly good 'The Road Warrior'. I've read that 'Mad Max' has the highest return on investment of any film ever made ($100K to make $100M in revenue generated); however upon watching this movie you will immediately be struck by its very low budget look and feel. If you've already watched 'The Road Warrior' you may want to watch this one to see where RW has its roots but you really need to watch RW first. Leonard Maltin (in his RW review) states that Mad Max is at least as good as RW; he is crazy. MM is a great movie for having been made for $100K but RW is a GREAT MOVIE period. One more thing this film is dubbed with American voices because someone in their infinite wisdom thought Americans wouldn't be able to understand Australian accents. This was a big mistake as the American voice actors invariably overacted in their dubbing. ",3.0
" I don't recommend this edition. Ok the picture is good and the Australian language track is quite cool but the movie is cut.In the scene in which Max visits the burned Goose in hospital has been censored meaning Goose's burned body isn't shown. Ok maybe that's something not everybody wants to see but if I buy a special edition I expect to see the whole movie. ",3.0
" It's not altogether surprising that Mad Max got such short shrift when it came out Stateside with an unfortunate dubbing job to eliminate the `Strine accents so American International could pretend it was an American film (Mel Gibson suffered perhaps a worse indignity with his screen credit moved to last position just before the lab credit on the trailers). Much of what people remember and love about Max is delivered in the sequel rather than this first outing. Indeed at times it feels more like a blueprint than a proper movie and Gibson barely registers in the surprisingly little screen time he has - the villains who all seem to be doing either premature Danny Huston impersonations or somewhat more timely German New Romantic turns make much more of an impression. Not only do huge sections of the film keep him offscreen but he makes little impact in his underwritten role when he is on. In many ways this is just a first low-budget draft of Max's world - civilization hasn't entirely crumbled yet and the precious juice is still flowing even if parts are getting hard to find. Still the car stunts are good if somewhat thin on the ground but this is one case where the sequels are definitely better.MGM/UA's special edition offers reasonable extras but they are limited by the non-involvement of George Miller and Mel Gibson and the unavailability of any archive footage. The making of featurette and audio commentary from crew members are the best of the bunch while the Gibson featurette tends to be too much of a puff piece. Despite being listed as the Australian trailer the theatrical trailer and the accompanying TV spots are all from the US release. Thankfully the original Australian soundtrack to the feature is included on this disc. ",3.0

" 'Mad Max' is one of those films that is on everyone's top film lists. Not only did it introduce us to Australian cinema but also a young 21-year old newbie named Mel Gibson. 'Mad Max' was dark it was brooding it was destructive and it never gave us that glimmer of hope for humanity but now - nearly 20 years later - does it still remain the classic that it started? Sure it was impressive to watch the crash scenes it was powerful to see the world through Mr. Miller's disturbed eyes but is it re-watchable? Does it have the appeal to see new things throughout if watched and watched again? For me the answer seemed to float near 'no'. While I loved what 'Mad Max' represented what it was - a full body of color and action - it wasn't something to be watched again and again. Gibson does a great job as Max a man torn between the evils of the road and his personal philosophies. He begins as an ominous optimist able to stop crime as it occurs on the streets but then as his sense of normality is turned upside down his ability to react and adapt is seen. The final moments he has transformed from the man we were first introduced to into something quite terrifying. One could also compliment Mr. Miller's directorial outing at times it felt a bit episodic with tough edits placed but for the majority he told a deathly story with great ease and excitement. So again there is no arguing that 'Mad Max' is an important film one that I am glad to have finally seen but once was enough. It seems to be lacking that re-watch excitement.But why has that conclusion been made? What makes 'Mad Max' mediocre instead of powerful? It is hard to pinpoint the exact scene but the sense of 'alright I've seen it - now what' was definitely present by the end. Yet there were points that I just loved. Gibson was perfect. He was incredible as Max and the world that Mr. Miller created was intense. The opening scene the car crashes as our bearded villain just yelled 'Toecutter' was fantastic. 'Mad Max' has one of those openings that just pulls you in that makes you excited to watch a film of this intensity but then where do you go? Miller seemed to indicate that more car crashes more violence more cliche family drama would indicate a stronger film. At times he was right his ability to create different scenes set across the same backdrop demonstrated his originality but then there were times where it just felt recycled. One scene that stands out is where our gang of bikers track down a couple that happens to be at the wrong place at the wrong time they chase them down and demoralize them as Max and his partner find them - then almost repetitively it happens with Max and his girl later in the film. In this post-apocalyptic world there seems to be no problem finding someone. Space seems to not be a problem. This was another unexplained moment - where the coincidence of discovering Max or finding the biker gang should have been more difficult. These repetitive essentially simplistic scenes seemed to detract from the power of what Max represented. One also needs to ask about the story the unknown of what time or place we are following Max - would this have strengthened the story knowing what world we lived in? The understanding that this was a low-budget film was rooted in my mind the techniques provided were impressive but should that have been neglected for mediocre storytelling? Perhaps I misread this film perhaps I missed the joy of why this is hailed as such a cult success.Another weakness against 'Mad Max' has to be the relationship between his wife/girlfriend and child. Again the lacking story helped confuse this viewer as to what dynamic they had but when we have scenes in which the child is completely forgotten about - it just decimates the reasons behind Max's anger and utter breakdown. There were several scenes in which I yelled at the screen 'What about the child' then finally they would remember - he seemed to fade in and out of existence too often for one film. Then when disaster strikes we are forced to believe that suddenly Gibson would release his inner rage? It just didn't work. The same can be said for his wife/girlfriend. A stronger definition of character and even more lines spoken would have helped me see the relationship. She seemed angry at first the product of a failed marriage forced by this post-apocalyptic world to stay together then we were introduced to love then suddenly she moved to idiocrity. Who would believe that running down a road when there are open fields around is the better option? It was these small inconsistencies that forced 'Mad Max' from greatness to just another average action film. Two-plus hour sweeping epics aren't always needed but stronger characters do help in creating the world that we as viewers are to inhabit for 90-ish minutes.Finally applause are in order for the villain in this film. The portrayal of Toecutter by Hugh Keays-Byrne was outstanding. The small attention to detail as well as his ability to make you feel like he would do anything to get his way - similar to the portrayal of Joker in 'The Dark Knight' - was an up moment for this film. Like a roller coaster 'Mad Max' had these ups and downs curves and jerks and when it was all said and done you really had to question whether you were going to ride it again. 'Mad Max' is an important film there is no question in my mind about that. The door that this film opened for future cinema in America couldn't have been done by a better group of filmmakers but it isn't a promising classic. I could not watch this film again. The sequels I am ready for but this ride is over - and the park is closing. I realize that I am in the minority but 'Mad Max' is a low-budget film that uses repetitive filmmaking as its staple - originality is present but you must search to find it.Grade",3.0

" This is an interesting film which if occasionally a bit wooden virtually created its own genre overnight and made Mel Gibson a star.Perhaps its most noteable feature was George Miller's use of unusual camera angles which created one or two iconic images.

" I find this type of history to be dubious. The author looks at one province and then generalizes his findings over the entire South Vietnamese nation. If one were to look at the attitudes of American colonists during the Revolutionary war by region one would find great disparities of opinion and support for the independence cause. Some areas of the colonies were strongly loyalist. Did this make the independence movement less valid? Another example; take two cities in Texas Austin and Fort Worth. Survey the populations of these areas about their opinions of President Bush. You would find greatly divergent aggregate views. My point is that this type of regional analysis is of limited use if you are trying to generalize over a population larger than the one investigated.It was no different in Vietnam. There were areas where the locals strongly supported the insurgency such as in the Iron Triangle which included Hau Nghia I believe. It is no surprise that the author found support for the insurgency here. On the other hand there were many places were the population strongly opposed the insurgency and even fled their arrival. Finally let us not forget that during the Tet offensive there was no general uprising against the South Vietnamese government as the communists fully expected there would be. Quite to the contrary in fact. The ARVN fought valiantly and the general population tried to stay out of the way and let the military restore order. Much as the general population does in all conflicts.This sort of parochial view of situations can have devastating effects on Policy just as it did with the over throw of Ngo Dinh Diem. The Saigon elites wanted Diem gone. But the Saigon elites had no more in common with the populace at large in Vietnam as Wall Street Financiers have with Iowa wheat farmers. Again the ideas of a small sampling were generalized over a large population and policy was formulated based on this. Another example of this concept can be found in one of the oft criticisms of Diem. Diem was often faulted for being a catholic in a predominantly Buddhist country. Calling Vietnam a Buddhist country is like calling the USA a Christian country. Probably most Americans call themselves Christian but what does this mean? It means many things and encompasses many ideas. Ideas that are often at odds with each other. The same was true in Vietnam at the time. This kind of historic generalization is of limited usefulness to understanding the larger context. The Author should have refrained from extending his conclusions to the larger whole based on an otherwise interesting investigation.As for those who served in Vietnam and had their opinions validated by this text. Again this is a question of generalizing over the whole one's own personal experiences. We all like to think of ourselves as representative of everyone else but this is not necessarily true either. I have the utmost respect for those who served in Vietnam. They did their duty during a difficult period in our history. However most American service personnel did not speak the language were isolated from the local population and only received a limited understanding of the situation in Vietnam. How can one truly fromulate a concrete understanding of something in such circumstances? Also is the perspective of the grunt humping the boonies going to be the same as a Saigon warrior? Clearly not. Many soldiers came away from Vietnam with opinions about the local population that were shaped by an extremely limited exposure to them in a myriad of different contexts. One does not have to look far however to find countless books by soldiers and civilians who worked closely with the Vietnamese and local populations and came to completely different conclusions. Most of the books written by those who understood the language or dealt with the Vietnamese regularly show a strong belief in the cause of aiding the Vietnamese. Those who got to truly know the Vietnamese most frequently came away with a very positive feeling toward them believed they were worthy of the efforts being expended by the USA and were sincere in their desire to be free of communist domination.It has been my intention here to point out the limitations of interpreting broad historical events by looking at microcosms in history. Having established this I do believe that this book is a worthwhile read. It is an interesting regional investigation of a complex environment. I would just admonish people to approach it with an appreciation of its limitations and seek other sources to contrast this book with for a broader understanding of the war in general. ",3.0

Her version of My Man is amazing. But her vpice is just not what ti used to be ",3.0
" Streisand's lastest CD *Guilty Pleasures* was a feast of songs she had never sung before and a reunion with Barry Gibb who writes for Barbra in a more contemporary way than the Bergmans or Marvin Hamlisch. It is a great CD and her voice is sublime aided of course by sound technicians. All artists owe their sound engineers their careers though. She and Barry have fun on it--it's fresh and alive. Not so much with the 2006 Concert CD a recording of the concert tour replete with IL Divo a mostly unnecessary addition. They are wooden men with BIG BORING voices.From the beginning Babs sounds tired hoarse and raspy. I saw her in concert where she sometimes sounded even worse than this recording. The engineers cleaned it up as well as they could leaving more than a hint of breathiness and weariness. Fortunately only about half of the songs are weakly rendered; the other half really are terrific experiences. I have no idea what is going on with her voice that from song to song there could be such differences but if I were Streisand I would leave the belting behind. It wouldn't hurt for her to warm up before she comes onstage not as she is giving the concert. For any price a fan would expect the performer to be well prepared. When she sings a soft ballad she often soars and her magic is prominent. It's painful to watch her crumble under the memory of her once youthful voice (and it was only a few years ago that she sounded like a 25 year old songstress). Streisand knows how to play a song for all its worth but she sometimes tramples it to death. *Don't Rain in My Parade* is just not what it used to be. She hits high notes but without the characteristic force. And she can hold the notes or seem to when she takes little breaks before each song's finale. Her phrasing is impeccable when she is giving it all she has to give but too often she seems bored. This is not a bad CD just not as inspired as *The Concert.*It also has to be said that it seems apparent Streisand is not taking care of her God-given voice one she herself has said that she takes for granted (unimaginable!!).The chatter inbetween songs is dull and preachy and it was exactly the same in every city except for blabbering about the fattening food she ate all across the US (excluded from the CD thank the Lord). The fans are really the stars on this CD--they roar constantly as if they had been starving to see Streisand all their lives. It's an odd treat. The orchestra is incredible but live it drowns her out at times (as does IL Divo). This recording does not relfect that though.If you do not own *The Concert* CD buy it and skip this one. This CD is for avid adoration-is-blind Streisand fans only and those keeping track of Streisand's vocal history.. ",3.0
" Big fan here always have been. Saw her in 1994 and 2000 and loved her voice and her song selection. Saw her in 2006 and left disappointed. I am not going to address the voice - let's face it - anyone expecting to hear Streisand in her prime is going to be disappointed. I want to address her song selection. How BORING! Like Garland's Over The Rainbow attendees cannot expect her not to sing the BIG ONES - Evergreen The Way We Were People and Happy Days Are Here Again - those are a given. But what about the rest?? Except for a few treasures (Cockeyed Optimist Unusual Way) the rest is a snooze fest. We already have live versions of Come Rain Or Come Shine (Australian Tour bonus CD from Barnes & Noble) Starting Here Starting Now Down With Love Children Will Listen What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life Somewhere. Where are the songs we haven't heard live before?? Perhaps something from Guilty Pleasures or Guilty? Anything from Yentl besides A Piece of Sky? If I Loved You? Perhaps songs she hasn't sung before from Broadway? Another Winter In A Summer Town or Will You from Grey Gardens? ANYTHING that wasn't written during the Ice Age would've sent the crowd and listener crazy. This is just more of the same just not sung quite as well as in the past. ",3.0
" I saw Streisand in concert this past October at Madison Square Garden in NYC. I have been a Streisand fan for many years and was hugely excited to actually be able to hear and see her sing live. By that point the reviews of her tour were glowing and I was looking so forward this very rare experience. I have to admit when I saw the show I felt a mixture of emotion but the most prominent was the feeling of being underwhelmed. Her voice was raspy and croaky and felt heavy in it's attempts to soar. I think her phrasing and breathe control is outstanding but the hoarseness makes this vocal instrument now far from pure. I hoped that this was simply a one night thing - she was having an off-night so much singing perhaps had strained her voice .However this record goes to show that Streisand's once incredible range power and vocal gymnastics are now on their way out. Of course she sounds good for 65 but this record in my mind should have never been released. It's hard to listen and not be disapointed. It's time that she put aside her arrogance and worked on her voice - she needs singing lessons she needs to change her diet she needs to have the voice that people want to hear not the lazy take it as you find it version. Barbra - call Celine she will give you tips on preservation! ",3.0

" For those who attended the concerts and were waiting to have a CD copy to 'feel the sense of being at her concert again' the CD is disappointed.This kind of live album is supposed to bring back the concert as it was with the highs and the lows. Even though Barbra was still great at the concert you could feel how her voice range has changed with age. (I am a lifelong fan of her musical career but not a worshiper) This album was so edited that it looks more like a enhance-in-studio product with a lot of cuts (sometimes they even abruptly cut her words...) than a concert. The sense of listening to a concert album is lost.This could be more appropiately named 'Highlights from the 2006 Tour concerts' since the production team seems like have picked the best performance of each song among the 16 dates and glue them in together.The decision to add different 'bonus' tracks for different outlets shows some lack of respect to her fans.

" I was happy to see Barbra at the MGM in Vegas some years ago and happy to see her come out from under her rock and perform for her fans. That concert was flawless and phenomenal.

" This cd set reveals a hoarse sounding Streisand that sings sincerely-but has finally lost that crystal siren of a voice.She sounds different as a mature live performerand I kept longing to hear that sonic instrument that has lost it's primal power.It is enjoyable and good-but not the songstress we once knew.I'm suprised that the diva didn't play with the sonics more in the studio-and that is refreshing.She has allowed her human frailty to be exposed.Yes she is a multi talented woman.

" Although Barbra is always great I have mixed feelings about this CD because Il Divo and Barbra just don't harmonize that well together. I love them both but not together.

But I still loved the CD and it's worth having. ",3.0
" It's like Miss Kittin didn't know what to do with her debut solo album so she did it all. As a result it's a distracting and ultimately uninspired release. There's a rap track (Requiem For A Hit) and a Frecnh lounge number (3eme Sexe) and a rockin' punk ditty (Meet Sue Be She) and a drony dub bit (Dub About Me) and bunch of other forgettable tracks. For me Miss Kittin is at her best when she talk/sings in that oh-so-bored voice backed by a throbbing trance or house beat like Madame Hollywood with Felix da Housecat or Walk On By with The Hacker. The only three tracks that live up to this is",3.0
" No one can be miss kittin...And no better that her to be a featured artist...Miss Kittin & The Hacker....What a breathtaking electroclash couple...Miss kittin & felix da Housecat....Both made the best unforgiven era of contemprary glittery retro electro music with their 2001 'Kittinz & The Glitz'...Miss kittin & Golden Boy",3.0
" When I heard Miss Kittin was going to be launching her solo album without the production help of the Hacker or Golden Boy (with whom she's released one album each plus a few singles) I was skeptical to say the least. Considering the last time I heard a DJ set by her she spent a lot of the time vocalizing like a bad haunted house effects box or ghost cat I had little faith in how she would pull it together for a full length.The album is scattered with varied results. Some tracks are electroclash rockers like 'Meet Sue Be She' and 'Professional Distortion' although the lyrics are so awful that it really detracts from what is otherwise pretty decent music. It is refreshing that she isn't completely relying on her 'I'm bored I'm bored' schtick that brought her attention originally with tracks on which she sings quite well as well as more aggressive vocals (a la T.Raumschmiere's 'The Game Is Not Over').All this considered I suppose it's no great surprise that the best songs are produced by the Hacker and Smash TV. 'Soundtrack of Now' is light on the vocals and heavy on the stiff 4 to the floor sound that characterized the duo's album on Gigolo. 'Dub About Me' is a dub reworking of Smash TV's 'What About Me' (from their outstanding 2002 album 'Electrified' on BPitch Control) with floating vocals by Miss Kittin as well as the original vocoded vocals from Smash TV.While the album is a bit uneven honestly it's better than I had expected. Miss Kittin is more of an artist than her image tends to let on and she has proven capable of assembling a reasonable set of tracks. The genre-hopping doesn't always work but it's never dull. ",3.0
" ok so i finally got this cd the other day i've been waiting to buy it for months. well it's not so great. i mean it's not bad just nothing as jaw-dropping good as any of her collabos. the first single 'professional distortion' sounds like it was written to be a single but its pretty ok. it sounds a little matmos/aphex twin-ish the lyrics are a little silly (the lyrics only get worse the further the album goes making you almost wish that miss kittin would just sing/speak her vocals in french check out the 'rocker' meet sue be she the lyrics are cringe-inducingly bad.)another song (beat for a hit) could be good with the strange pairing of the kittin and some m.c. kind of going for a bit of slowed down ghetto tech. the song gets longish and very repetitive though. yea... the only song on the album that the hacker does the music for (soundtrack of now) is also almost all instrumental which is sad cuz its the best music on the album. so i'm sad because i really wish she would've just done another album with the hacker. he really seemed to know how to utilize her talents. this album is meandering and at times just kinda boring. it gets 3 stars cuz its still better than most crap that gets put out.

" 1.Professional Distortion - This is a great song it's wicked and would fit perfectly into the cd players of the guys with massive speakers in their cars. It's loud funky and the beat is one of the best i've ever heard. Cooly funny lyrics too. THey don't make sense. Gets boring quickly. 9/102.Requiem for a Hit - This song is sooo good! At first i hated it but it really grew on me with its incredibly simple beat and that synth that just pumps all the way through. It gets even better when Miss Kittin starts singing too. 7.5/103.Meet Sue Be She - Kind of annoying an obvious filler track. Miss kittin's voice makes me laugh again and the lyrics are woeful. But its a good song to jump around to. Pretty catchy though. 7/104.Happy Violentine - A bit of a long track but well worth the time for the experience. When i first heard it i was taken aback by Miss Kittin's songwriting talent almost flabbergasted. It gets even better when all the synths pianos and singing all manage to wind together nicely in the end. 9/105.Allergic - This song is cute and fun it's quite wierd it's very quiet and trance-like but still has a fast beat. It's unusual to the ears but its still an above average listen. 8/106.Kiss Factory - Easily the worst track on the album another filler. It doesnt make sense and its very annoying and generic. I guess one could call it catchy but i could never stand it even with 5+ listens. Turn it off please. 4/107.Clone Me - The best track on the album. It's got an awesome synth paced throughout the entire song like Requiem for a hit and is very danceable. Catchy beat and tune i love it. The lyrics like the lyrics in most of the album are nonsensical but you forget about them quickly. Great chorus - 'Hello Kittin you came to play Hello Kittin you look strange today...' 9.5/108.I Come.com - Lyrics are utter nonsense. The whispering at the beginning is kind of annoying but once the rhythmic singing comes in halfway through it gets very very good. And the way she distorts her voice is great too. 8.5/109.Soundtrack of Now - The only song on the album featuring The Hacker and thank god. This song is so annoying and is incredibly uncreative. It's a bit of a joke on this album and its about time Kittin dropped The Hacker once and for all. Worse song on the album. 2.5/1010.Neukolin - This is really just an experiment in music. It makes no sense and the only lyrics are a few words in german. It's very synthy and not pleasant to listen to. It's an experience. 6.5/1011.Dub About Me - Another slow long song but not as good as Happy Violentine. It's still very good and makes you think. It could do without the heavy jarring synth that comes through every now and then. 7.5/1012.3eme Sexe - BEST SONG EVER! This song sums up the album perfectly. It's a beautiful french ballad with a hint of electronica. If there's one song you need to listen to it's this one. Beautiful chorus beautiful music. Leaves you with good impressions of the album. A perfect 10/10. ",3.0

" I read about this book in a New Republic article about Lopez Obrador the leftist who recently lost in Mexico's presidential election. Obrador is from the southern state of Tabasco an isolated southern state that Greene visits in this book. Greene's interest in the state stems from the fact that in the 1930's the region's governor spearheaded one of the most virulent anti-religious campaigns in all of Mexico. Greene was commissioned to write about how Mexicans were coping during this period of intense suppression of religious expression. My interest in the book was purely historical and sociological; I wanted to better understand the ideology that led the state to clamp down on religious institutions and how ordinary Mexicans reacted to this. In that sense the book did not quite live up to my expectations. Instead in spite of the beautiful prose (which ensures a pretty quick read) and occasional sparks of wisdom the book read like a bitter disgruntled travelogue.For starters as Greene himself concedes his Spanish was apparently not so good at the time something that obviously limited his ability to talk with ordinary Mexicans who knew no English (this is not to mention that many of the Indians in Tabasco and Chiapas did not even speak Spanish). Tabasco and Chiapas are both built up at as hearts of darkness; he announces at the beginning of the book his intention to visit these remote places but he does not even reach Tabasco until halfway through the book as the first part consists of his journey from Texas down to Mexico City. And then when he finally does reach these places the effect is rather anti-climactic as he doesn't even seem to talk to any ordinary Mexicans about the religious situation. Obviously this probably had a lot to do with people's unwillingness to talk about such a politically sensitive issue but it was still disappointing that he went to so much effort to reach such remote places only to come away with so few real insights. In Tabasco and Chiapas the only people Greene seems to befriend are odball expatriate Europeans and Americans. These were fascinating characters and the stories of how they ended up in the backwaters of southern Mexico are worthy stories on their own but I think we would be critical of any contemporary journalist who only fraternizes with expats.Perhaps the most disturbing thing though is something that Sirin alludes to in his review (but surprisingly none of the other reviewers have mentioned) namely Greene's explicit hatred for the country and its people which was quite unexpected. As I was reading it I kept reminding myself of the context since the book was written in the 1930's from an obviously colonial mindset. However by the end of the book when Greene is tired ill and ready to return home the bitterness towards Mexico becomes hard to ignore. Virtually every behavioral trait he observes in Mexicans obviously hides sinister intentions. He has something bad to say about every place his train passes through. Again I realize that the author was fatigued from his travels and ill at this point but it still didn't make for particularly fun reading.I gave the book three stars because it does have many merits. As I mentioned Greene writes beautifully (I have read and loved the 'The Comedians' and plan to read some of his other novels in the near future). Also the simple fact that he visited some of these remote places during this interesting period of Mexico's history makes the book intrinsically interesting. Overall however the book just wasn't quite what I expected. ",3.0
" I was thrilled to hear about this book from a friend who suggested she was going to adopt for Advent a theme of thanksgiving and praise to God especially for the negative circumstances in her life. I felt this was an answer to a prayer since I'd been hoping to find some nice Christian fiction reading. So I found the book on amazon.com and bought it right away just in time for the start of Advent. The book initially seemed very good to promote these ideas. However since I have an M.A. in Theology from a Dominican school I had to try hard to overlook her harsh misrepresentation of Thomas Aquinas beginning on pg. 161. I set the book aside for a few hours and was able to return to it because I really enjoyed the earlier parts of the book. Then the author began again on pg. 173 and I just couldn't continue reading with her untruths. I had to wonder why she was so adamant about proving a wrong point and whether the other parts of her book were as unfounded as this.To expound - To classify Thomas Aquinas with the likes of Kant Calvin Rousseau - is utterly ridiculous to anyone who has any familiarity with the discipline of philosophy. If her statement is that they are philosophers and think (use their minds) and hence brought on the Age of Reason well this is superficially true. Does she regret the Age of Reason?If her statement is that reason when used to the exclusion of emotions is unbalanced her statement is true. However she is unaware of Aquinas's lengthy treatment of the emotions and their itegration in what he calls the 'intellect.' His definition of the intellect differs substantially from what we call the 'intellect' in our post-modern culture. The 'intellect' is much more expansive in his definition and does not act in exclusion to the emotions.In fact when I began to read his analysis of the emotions it was the healthiest description I'd encountered anywhere. He believes the emotions are all good all very natural. The emotions are our very personal and individual response to the environment to external stimuli and they simple are what they are. It is our response to the emotion and our consequent actions which are considered 'good' or 'bad.' We engage our intellect to decide what is good to do in each situation. The emotions themselves are completely integral to our healthy lives and cannot be judged.I am disappointed in yet another 'protestant' work which is misinformed about the very foundations of Christianity and chooses to bury an attack so deeply in its text. I was hoping for an uplifting and encouraging book to read.I will use this opportunity to suggest to ministers that the material you receive in your seminaries regarding the Catholic faith is incomplete and misinformed. Having spoken to numerous pastors about their scathing critiques of Catholicism they have admitted that their beliefs are based on their learnings at seminary. I have informed them they are factually mistaken in their teachings and to research for themselves. I will grant to author Catherine Marshall that Thomas Aquinas' seminal work 'Summa Theologica' is a very difficult read. Perhaps she relied on hearsay to form her opinions. I would encourage you to read and determine for yourself so you are not proven fallacious in your beliefs. You might enjoy it; I found it quite beautiful. ",3.0

" As the title indicates this book is about crucial confrontations. It starts off by defining what a crucial confrontation is and why we should care to have it. Then discusses how to know what crucial confrontation to hold and if one should hold it. After that comes what to do during a crucial confrontation and last but not least what to do after it. I believe that Crucial Confrontations are a crucial tool/mechanism that any successful leader should have in his arsenal. If used effectively it helps promote a culture of accountability which usually entails high performance and high engagement. This book explains in depth the process from start to finish both within a personal and work setting. The reason I gave this book a lower rating despite the very valuable content is that I felt that the material could have been more condensed and presented in a shorter more story-like format. I would recommend skimming through this book but definitely focus on the summaries of each of the chapters/stages of a confrontation. ",3.0

" I think if Joan Crawford had not been cast in this film it would not be given much importance because it is not that good a film but she manages to give one of her most sympathetic performances one for which she was nominated for an Academy Award although she should have recieved this honor for some of her other work like JOHNNY GUITAR or WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE?. Almost singlehandly she manages to provide the movie with many moments of unbearable suspense though the directon is not too shabby. The director David Miller uses light and shadows to provide a good tension filled atmosphere and Gloria Grahamein a performance for which she was nomintated as best supporting actress also supplies great support and she is defintley a highlight. Jack Palance is very menacing in this movie and he also manages to do a good job. The script is not that original though and ultimatly the script is the problem with the movie. And before i forget the story is about a playwright named Myra Hudson(Joan Crawford) who marries the actor she fired from her play(Jack Palance).

" NOMADS OF SOUTH PERSIA was written in the 1950s when the (nearly always male) researchers tried to conform to a perceived scientific norm. At the time Barth wrote a book for specialists not for general readers and his work has become a minor classic in the field. However anthropology has gone through many a twist and turn since then. It is doubtful if many anthropologists want to read the same book today. I recently did. I have no idea whether nomadic life continues in Iran today or if it does--- (the New York Times recently reported a 'nomad conference' that took place in Ethiopia with some Iranian participation)---if it resembles the description in this book. We might call Barth's work 'social history' now. It is a book that gives no quarter to non-specialists. If you can't use industrial-strength kinship terminology you will have a hard time following several chapters. However there are a number of interesting matters for example the nomads' animals thrive best if kept to a nomadic life. Staying all year at one place increased mortality dramatically. More centrally nomad women had a stronger role to play than those in villages because their cooperation was an economic necessity. Decision making at the lowest level of nomadic society (chiefly about moving or not moving camp) was complex and subtle due to the relative independence of everyone and complex family relations. The connection of the Basseri nomads with other nomads and with the larger sedentary society was equally interesting. The tendency of richer nomads was to invest surplus money in land; the tendency of poorer nomads to leave the nomadic life and settle down as landless labor in villages. Barth contrasts nomad and sedentary not as separate ethnic groups so much but as different life patterns extant in the same country. A vast social gulf existed between powerful village landowners and the subject landless laborers but among nomads though all were subject to the chief each household maintained considerable freedom and as long as they had enough animals economic independence.Barth concentrated on describing economic social and political organization. There is virtually nothing else in the 153 pages. You can admire this focussed approach so typical of the time or you can regret the lack of a more humanistic style which would have allowed the nomads some voice given a reader more sense of people and place examined symbol and ritual to a far greater extent or provided some clue as to Barth's own role among the Basseri. Alas self-revelation was not often thought of in that era we can hardly blame him. What startled me was the information that the author spent only three months with the Basseri. I finished the book wondering how accurate his description was and how much reflected a fine theoretical mind with an innovative cast. Barth did seem to be properly cautious about what informants said but with three months he would not have had enough time to observe actual life. Thus if the author had stayed longer with the Basseri a different book might have been written. Like Margaret Mead Barth seems to have made the most out of a short period of field work. I can only admire him for that but questions do remain. ",3.0

Fans that wants to see their hero doing his famous splits and martial arts moves will be disappointed but if you are wanting a good old-fashioned action adventure without any elaborate special effects which seems to have taken over movie making these days Legionnaire fits the bill. Good battle sequences foreign legion heroics some sweeping desert photography plus a strong supporting cast makes this Van Damme entry a worthwhile one.

" I think the television listing description I read on this movie was misleading - actually no it was wrong. According to what my TiVo said the story followed a 1920s playboy who returns from a stint in the Foreign Legion to reclaim his former lover (a mobster's girl). Obviously the person who wrote this has never seen this movie. For starters he wasn't so much a playboy as he was a boxer and for second he never returns to France to reclaim his former lover. In fact we learn through the progress of the film that the woman in question has emigrated to the United States.Okay enough gripes about how inaccurate tv listings can be - what did I think about the movie in question. It's actually okay as far as Jean Claude VanDamme movies go except he really doesn't do much in the way of martial arts as he has in previous films. Instead he relies more on a rifle to shoot charging North African tribesmen or fists to straighten out fellow Foreign Legionnaire's who get their kicks out of bullying their weaker colleagues.Jean Claude plays a boxer who after reneging on a promise to throw a fight escapes into the French Foreign Legion to flee the clutches of a murderous mobster. There he is flung headfirst into the North Africa war between the local nomadic tribesmen and the occupying French forces.What was really a treat was the presence of Steven Berkoff. It's been awhile since I have seen him in a movie. He was a very high profile in the early to mid 1980s in movies such as `Beverly Hills Cop' `Octopussy' and `Rambo",3.0
" Here in Japan this film was given a limited theatrical release. in 2001. Before I see this movie I knew this film went straight to video in USso I didn't expect much fun from it. Frankly the plot is a dull one; the situation is borrowed from the typical 'leginnaire' films like Beau Geste and there is nothing new nor original here. Well and for fans of the previous films of the star it must be disappointing because there is no bone- crunching action scenes. Still it has good authentic location and superb supporting cast including Steven Berkoff and Nicholas Farrell. My favorite actor Steven Berkoff displays his over-the-top acting (though a bit overacting you may think) and I find it very delightful and Nicholas Farrell's subtle performance is giving some reason for not avoiding the video. Not a classic but good one of the genre. ",3.0

" I did like this initially and thought this type of lid would be more secure and splatter-proof. But it can be a pain to clean and still splatters even if I pre-treat the rice. After having this a year the plastic never seems to look or smell right no matter how hard I clean it. I stopped making soups and steaming and decided to just stick to rice because of the 'smell' factor to the plastic. My teflon pan is discolored too - although I'm very careful to only use plastic with it and gentle cleansers. I hesitate between a 2 or 3 star review because...the Sanyo is cute  it has cooked rice predictably and for the first couple months I really liked it. It just doesn't seem to hold up to long-term use. IronicallyI picked up an old Hitachi chime-a-matic for $3 at a thrift store and like it a lot more than my Sanyo (which will be going to goodwill).

It is slower than the previous ones I had (Hitachi Panasonic) -- eg the same quantity of rice which cooked in 20mn takes more than 1/2 hr -- and what I didn't realize is that the chord is neither detachable nor retractable making it very awkward to move it around to clean serve reorganize my countertop.... Also it seemed prone to leaks at first (wasn't sealing properly? the rubber needed to break in I guess)... time will tell whether it is as durable as the other brands. Another important point is that it took several cleaning/boiling sessions for us to get rid of the chlorine smell of the (supp. PVC) white plastic steaming basket. I like its simplicity though. ",3.0
" I purchased this rice cooker to replace my 30 year old (yes 30) National unit. It cooks rice well enough no better or worse than my older one but at least it has the warming feature that my older one did not have. It also works very well as a steamer. However there are two problems with this unit that are somewhat annoying. First there is no 'on/off' switch so if it is plugged in the warming function is on so you cannot just leave it sitting on the counter top plugged in. The second issue is that in my case water collects between the inner and outer walls of the unit (I am guessing that the 'dew collector' on the back is overflowing) requiring that I invert the unit and shake the water out.Overall it is not a bad unit but in my opinion Sanyo cut a few corners in an effort to keep the price down and it results in a less than ideal appliance ",3.0

" For some reason I always manage to botch rice the old fashioned way. Not enough water too much water too much heat. It never turns out right which is why I bought a rice maker. I also love steel cut oats which the reviews said this machine also cooked with ease. I used it a lot when I first bought it and it cooked everything very well. However I don't know if something on the machine broke or if I'm now doing something wrong but every time I try to cook my steel cut oats the lid opens up on its own and a gooey starchy mess of boil-over spills down the sides and onto my counter. When the lid opens up it also allows the water to evaporate and doesn't cook the oats properly (sometimes they're still a little crunchy). Also when there's a boil over mess it takes a lot of effort to clean all of the nooks and crannies on this machine. At first I didn't notice that there's some kind of plastic container thing on the back...and I didn't notice it until it started smelling of rotten something-or-other because dirty rice/oat water had been fermenting in it for several weeks. On cleaning the insert is really easy to wash even if you let it sit after cooking because it's nonstick. The rest of the machine including the lid and the lid gasket is a huge pain to clean if you don't wipe it down while it's still warm...and I'm notoriously bad about doing that. For this reason the rice maker has been stuck in a closet for several months now. Perhaps I'll dig it out again and give it another go because it really does a lovely job making rice...but since rice is only half the reason I bought it (oats being the other) for now it's way more of a pain to use than it's worth.

" I bought this rice cooker several months ago after researching all the options. In general I've been quite pleased with it. It makes tasty rice; the metal insert is easy to clean and the closed design prevents it from making that annoying clanking noise that occurs with cheaper rice cookers (i.e. the sound of the lid bouncing around as air escapes). For better or worse however it takes forever to actually make rice. A single 1 cup batch of rice can take 30+ minutes to cook. This means that I have started a 'quick' stir-fry on several occasions only to realize that my rice wouldn't be done for at least 10 minutes after the other food was on the table. Usually this can be circumvented by starting the rice before all the other food but I still find it somewhat inconvenient. One should also be aware of the tiny plastic drainage cup in the back of the machine. It does accumulate water from the cooking process so it should be cleaned regularly. Otherwise it gets gross. Overall I find this to be a very nice rice cooker. It does make good rice. It is not fast though so if you're looking for a quick machine this is not your best option. ",3.0
" A friend of mine spent a summer in Japan and came back with a Minidisc recorder and several compilations of crazy Japanese music. He'd lost all the artists names but one track named 'Doubt' caught my attention.Well two weeks ago I bought this on a whim because the cover looked neat. Once in my hands it looked even better but while I listened to the first track and scanned over the track list I noticed a song called 'Doubt' and then quickly associated the vocals I was hearing with the long-lost song. I quickly jumped to 'Doubt' and was treated to an alternate recording that I wasn't familiar with though it was clear that it was the same song. After a few moments of searching the internet I'm introduced to Hide. (the version I knew is usually labeled 'Doubt '97' or 'Doubt (Mixed LEMONed Jelly Mix').For a westerner Hide's solo work is pretty spotty. Three albums and a smattering of singles across the mid-90s much of it sounding like high-speed pop music with soaring solos and dripping with cheese. As far as I can tell Hide is to hair metal what hair metal is to heavy rock bands. After an evening sampling Hide's solo project it became pretty clear why his music needed to be 'altered' if he wanted any kind of success in the west. I'm not sure if jumping on the over-engineered industrial metal train was the best approach.While technically competent none of the tracks really stick with me (aside from 'Doubt' for obvious reasons). 'Fuctrack#6' is an embarrassing introduction to the tail end of the disc. By the time it comes on you'll be thirty minutes deep and you might as well stick around for what follows -- some of Hide's heavier tracks borrowed and re-recorded.Make no mistake this is Hide's attempt to bring his music to the west. Ray McVeigh and Paul Raven are here as well as a closet full of friends but nobody really takes the stage away from Hide. Don't buy this for the guest appearances list you'll be sorely disappointed -- for example Jaz Coleman shouts for less than a minute opposite some broad who wants to 'f you up the a until you bleed'. Hmm. And what exactly Geordie and Chris Vrenna contributed to all this I haven't been compelled enough to open up the booklet and figure out just yet.Unfortunately Hide passed away before this album was released. In America only a handful of fans of X Japan and whoever picked up the Heavy Metal 2000 soundtrack ever noticed. Don't let that stop you from checking it out if you're fascinated with this era or this sound but don't expect a lost gem. ",3.0
" Part of hide's charm was his free-wheeling venture into all different styles of rock music. Here the american producers of the album seem to have targeted it to a particular industrial-explicit niche losing a lot of the lightness humor and experimentation found in hide's other albums.

The musicians are excellent and the mix great but I don't find any of the songs particularly memorable. ",3.0

" A Philadelphia Catholic in King James Court was an ok book. Michael O'shea and his family move to Kentucky to live with his uncle after his father dies. Michael learns a lot more about his religion than he already knew and he also learned a little bit about his uncle's religion. Michael is forced to defend his faith to his uncle's church members and elders. This book is mainly about the arguing of Catholics and fundamentalists. Catholics believe that the bible is from tradition and fundamentalists believe that the bible is the final say in what they do. I also thought that the book was really unrealistic. What kind of teenager would spend a whole summer studying his catholic faith? I know the way that I am going to do work in the summer is if I am in summer school or I have to do work for the future school year. I also would not expect a 14 year old kid to be reciting bible passages in the middle of his sentences to back up his thoughts.

Although it explained most of the aspects of the Catholic faith in depth the presentation of these ideas was in a boring manner. It was just plain talk and no excitement. Also there we some things in the book I could not believe were true. I thought about how Michael's whole summer revolved around the Bible and work. There was no play fun or friends just dedication to the Bible. I found that hard to believe because many teens want to have fun along with having a faith. Michael just had a faith it seemed. Also I thought it was hard to believe how Michael started down in Kentucky not knowing alot about the Bible and by the end of three months he knew more than his uncle who had been studying the Bible for years.

I think many parts of this book were greatly exaggerated. I also looked at the book in other ways too. I understood my religion more and now I have a clear understanding of the difference between Biblical Fundamentalists and Catholics. I see the flaws in Fundamentalism and now I know good arguments to prove Fundamentalists wrong. ",3.0
" A Philadelphia Catholic In King James's Court was an exceptional book which consisted of Protestant and Catholic conflicts within the Bible. The quality of the book was compromised when the author's ideas and beliefs were introduced into the book. For example the author talks about how he likes the city and the country but hates the suburbs which I feel resents me and my lifestyle on page 20. The story was quite simple and a little uninteresting because the timing of the story was a little unrealistic and slow in the sense that the author tried to fit everything in during the one summer Mike was at the farm. Mike's character didn't fit any type of teenager that I know and I couldn't relate to the story through Mike in any other sense other than the Catholic sense. The story was full of religious concepts and conflicts but didn't have much relation to a teenager's problems my troubles and confusions. A Philadelphia Catholic In King James's Court was a complete story with a plot that could flare an interest in people who have encountered Apologetics in their life but did not flare my interests. I consider the story to be a good basis on Catholic beliefs and a good understanding of the conflicts between religions. This was a good book in the aspect of religion and a good book for the faithful Catholic or Protestant but not for many other types of people. ",3.0
" I felt a Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a pretty good book but it lacked an entertaining plot and some aspects of the book were unusual. It was a good book in that it explained and supported the Catholic faith strongly. It showed me some things in the Bible that I did not know were there. Although it explained most of the aspects of the Catholic faith in depth the presentation of these ideas was in a boring manner. It was just plain talk and no excitement. Also there were some things in the book I could not believe were true. I thought about how Michael's whole summer revolved around the Bible and work. There was no play fun or or frineds just dedication to the Bible. I found that hard to believe because many teens want to have fun along with with having faith. Michael just had a faith it seemed. Also I thought it was hard to bleieve how Michael started down in Kentucky not knowing alot about the Bible and by the end of the summer he knew more than his uncle who had been studying the Bible for years. Although it had these minor flaws I thought the book was very informative and it helped me understand my own faith a little better. ",3.0
" Although this book was not very exciting in my opinion it gave me some new insights on Fundamentalist and Catholic views of the Bible. There is some background information in the story about the Bible and its meaning. It explains passages from certain sections in the Bible and gives some understanding to the time when it was written. I also learned about Fundamentalists and their view of Biblical interpretation. If you decide to purchase this book I recommend that you pay close attention to how the Fundamentalists sometimes contradict themselves and also how Michael (the main character) approaches the scripture. This book is great if you are interested in learning about the Catholic or Protestant religions or want to know what certain sections of the Bible mean. ",3.0
" Yo The book A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a nice book I enjoyed readin it very much. The book had a deeper meaning then what was on the surface. The story is about a boy named Mike. Mike's dad dies in a fire in the beginning of the story because of this his mom and siblings move to Kentucky with his cousins. Mike very much likes Kentucky and the farm at which they are staying at yet his uncle Les pressures him very much to become part of the Fundelmentalist church. Mike wants to stay Catholic because that is what his laid father was. The book explains mikes problems exposure opinion and experiences. The book was very insightful to a catholic who was learning about his faith like I am. This is not only a good read it would be perfect for teens or adults. It presents the reasoning on both sides very effectively and realistically. Because the defenses are in the context of an interesting novel I found myself more able to follow the line of reasoning. thank u for ur time ",3.0
" This book really showed me that although Christians share the same basic beliefs the denominations are very different from each other. In this book Michael a teen from Philadelphia takes on his uncle's town of Bible-wielding maniacs in Kentucky. Michael all but shows up these maniacs by expressing his Catholic views through scripture. The part about this book that is confusing is the fact that Michael can defeat a group of men who have been studying the Bible their whole lives after reading just a few commentaries on the Bible.

" When I first was presented this book in class I figured it would be a corny 'love everyone' book (like the typical religion textbook). I was pleasantly surprised at its ability to keep me awake (most of the time); however it's only the first step towards apologetic novels that can be truly effective. The beginning portion is rather boring and full of unnecessary drivel. The portion in which he absorbs the Biblical knowledge later used in arguments seemed as if de Porres wrote that at the last minute for two reasons. Firstly he hardly refers to any of the information that Michael cites in his speeches despite saying in subtext that he did so. Secondly how could anyone absorb all that Biblical interpretation in such a short time let alone use it effectively? This stemmed out into other smaller contradictions which made it hard to read between the lines at times. Beyond that de Porres made readable what many could not",3.0
" A Philadelphia Catholic in King Jame's Court starts out a tragic turn of events. Michael and his family lose their father in a fire. His family is now going to move to they country and out of the city with his uncle and his family on their farm. The story really gets going as Michael adjusts to his new lifestyle. His uncle Les is a very religious man. Having once been a Catholic he converted to Fundamentalist because of differences in beliefs. Michael too started to question his religion. Yet he realized that Catholics had a different way of viewing the bible mass and Traditions. Michael spoke at Les's church in discussions explaining and proving Catholicism to the Fundamentalists. In this book you will see many controdictions and inconsistencies in Les's religion.This book is great for finding out for what you believe and what your religion means to you. It points out many problematic areas of the church and clears them out. Martin De Porres Kennedy wrote this book well and I think that it does its job; in explaining Catholicism. I never thought this book would be one that I'd enjoy but it turned out to be a very good read and an informational book. ",3.0
" A Philadelphia in King James Court is a good book to read to learn more about the catholic faith but if you were interested in reading a pleasure book you wouldn't be satisfied. Personally I didn't like the book it was a very well written and formatted book but it was also very boring. I like books with suspense and this was more of a strait forward book explaining the differences between the Catholic Church and the fundamentalist. The Catholic being Michael and his father who had died and the Fundamentalist being Les Michaels Uncle. Michael O'Shea is a 17 year old boy who is living a normal life when unexpectedly his father died in a fire. Michael had to move down south with his Uncle where he learns about their religions and about his own religion also. This is where we learn about the way of a fundamentalist compared to our Catholic religion. Even though I did not like the book I learned a lot about it in Mr. Puntel's class the book itself was very boring but when you take it into a classroom or a study you can learn a lot about your faith and about the faith of the people around you. ",3.0
" This book is good and bad in some parts. It makes sense what Michael is explaining but if you think about it it doesn't make any sense. Michael moved from Philadelphia to Georgia/Alabama/SOUTH because his dad died in a heroic effort to save someone. First of all why would he leave there and second why would he go to the south instead of with relatives or back to their house in Philly. The arguments Michael presents make sense and he destroys what the fundamentalists say so much that they throw him out of the south. How does Michael learn all of this does it pop in to his head one morning and he decides to start bashing on the people he is living with and go against his mothers brothers religion. If I was his mom I would slap him and leave the south because there is no reason for him to go against it. Michael meets Les who is the leader of the local church and he has a sermon about go-between people. He says they are wrong and then when the sermon is over he decides to question the person who he is living with on his morals and religion. Les cannot explain the final answer to his sermon because he doesn't know the answer to it. The same thing happens when they go to mass at a catholic church down south. The pastor gives a sermon and Michael has no clue what he is talking about so he asks the pastor what he meant and he failed to answer him also. Then Michael realizes somehow that the fundamentalists are wrong about everything so he starts arguing with local fundamentalist leaders. In the end Michael is kicked out of the south for arguing with the head fundamentalist guy and I guess he goes back to live inPhilly with his friends. This book is good on the issues but there are key things missing to the plot. ",3.0
" as i first started reading this book i couldent stand it. it was boring and pointless. i didnt know why i was reading it but after a few chapters it got better. i found out i was reading this book because it explains some things about the catholic church like why catholics have a pope and why catholics honor mary. this is a good book to read for anyone who is thiking of becoming a catholic or for catholics who do not agree with certain church teachings. eventually this book became a book i actually wanted to read instead of just reading it because it explained things about the cathoolic church. it had a good plot. i would give this book 3 stars because it was not too boring and it was very education.

This book is a great book to read if you are trying to find your faith as a Catholic. ",3.0
" This book was interesting. It was interesting to see how Michael defended his own Catholic faith against the fundamentalists. I have to be honest and say that if this book had been an optional reading assignment I would have opted not to. On the other hand I am glad in a way that it was not optional because at the end of the story I had learned some things and been given some new ideas that I had not had before. I read this book with more of an understanding of the protestant side being a Presbyterian (even though I have become familiar with the Catholic practice in Mr. Puntel's class at LaSalle College High School). Some of the things mentioned by Michael in this story were foreign at first but through class discussions I was able to get a better understand and learn some new things about the Catholic Faith that I had not yet picked up in my textbook. I would say that if you are looking for a thriller to read that this is not exactly the type of book you want to read but if you are looking to learn something new about both Catholic and Protestant Christianity this book would be an excellent start.

" I felt that 'A Philadelphia Catholic in King James' Court' was a well written book with a couple minor flaws. This book was about a young teenager named Michael who moved to Kentucky to live with his uncle for the summer. While there he learned many things. He learned that he didn't know everything about his own religion and he also studied a totally different religion. I felt that this book taught me many things. The book taught me about the beliefs of Fundamentalists. The book even taught me things I didn't know about my own religion. A Philadelphia Catholic depicts the differences between the two religions. The Fundamentalists believe that the Bible must be taken word for word; while the Catholics believe in the Bible they also base some of their religion on traditions. This book also had a couple flaws. I felt that the book was unrealistic. A teenager wouldn't spend his/her summer reading and studying about their religion as well as another religion. Another flaw was that even if a teenager studied about these religions he wouldn't become an expert so quickly. I found that rather than enjoying the book I learned from the book.. It seemed that the book was more like a text than it was a story. Overall the book was good but the flaws prevented me from giving the book five stars. ",3.0

" When our class was assigned this book to read like everyone else I thought it would be another boring book that we were being forced to read.

The main character is Michael O'shea. He is a 17 year old boy living a normal life in Philadelphia until his father dies in a fire. After his father's death he moves down south to live with his uncle Les who is a Fundamentalist. While Michael is living with his uncle he learns the differences between Catholics and Fundamentalists. For instance he learns why the Catholic Bibles have more books than the Fundamentalist Bibles and why Catholics have a Pope.This book would not be satisfying to a reader just reading a book for enjoyment.

" 'The Sinful Dwarf' is a Danish/American production which actually played in theaters in Denmark (I've talked people to who saw the 'shocking' premiere). The lead actor Torben Bille is one the most recognized dwarf actors in Denmark...I guess he would rather forget this ultra bizarre piece of sexploitation.Torben lures innocent young girls to his mom's house with help of mechanical toy poodles. They are drugged and tied up and later abused by 'clients' and/or sold into slavery. In between Dwarf and his drunk mom are doin' several musical numbers. The many sex scenes are pretty close to porn and the soundtrack reminded me of the Residents. It's like an insane mix between 'Bloodsucking Freaks' and 'Pink Flamingos' with zero comic relief - this movie will blow your mind.

" From grindhouse and sleaze-meister Harry Novak and out of the deepest recesses of the 70's came - 'Dvrgen' ('The Sinful Dwarf') AKA 'Das Haus der verlorenen Madchen' 1973 and directed by Vidal Raski. Three minutes into the film we knew this was going to be one sick ride! 'Olaf' (Torben Bille) had a penchant for young innocent girls (who were also naive enough to fall for the charms of a devilish looking dwarf with wind up toys!) as he lured them to follow him home to become unwitting sex slaves! Oh and his pleasant mother 'Lila' (Clara Keller) actually encouraged this behaviour since it brought in additional income. When a young unsuspecting couple 'Mary' and 'Peter' (Anne Sparrow and Tony Eades) suddenly showed up looking for a room to let Olaf obligingly agreed (when a dwarf jumps on the bed in the room you're looking to rent and says in a Danish accent..'you see...it is a nice soft bed' and lets off a sinister cackle. Maybe it's not a good idea and politely you would say thanks but no thanks!!) and took them upstairs. Did I mention that mother 'Lila' (not to be confused with 'Lola') appeared to be a washed-up cabaret performer (she definitely did not play the 'Blue Angel') and had an inclination to dress up and sing after her drinking sessions! This flick is pretty sick and sleazy but believe it or not it's done in such a campy and looney way that you will actually find yourself laughing along with cuddly Olaf and his dear mother!!! I won't give anymore away. This is the triple xxx version (the film elements do not match but they do not appear to be inserts) so there was more than just poor naked gals! The actress that played Mary (Anne Sparrow) was actually pretty good and she definitely had a lovely figure! But its really 'Olaf' and 'Lila' that stole the show here we even got a quick glimpse at 'Lila's' disfigured body (just kidding actually the old dame was in pretty good shape. I would have wanted to see more of her with singing of course!!) she did have a scar along her left cheek (on her face do pay attention)! This was an American-Danish co-production and as I've written so many times before only in the 70's could they have gotten away with a barbaric and sadistic piece of work like this one ( but of course plenty of enthusiasts like myself already knew that) it's pretty bad. The reason I'm only giving it 3 stars the pacing was slow and unfortunately the production-values here were very low ($10000.00 more from uncle Harry could have raised the bar!) not the best lighting or camera work.

" I watched this movie yesterday on a lovely Saturday afternoon. Maybe i should have went to the beach because all this movie did was make me restless. Yes indeed it was a quality movie with great acting by Ian Mckellen and Lynn Redgrave. The thing that ruined it for me was Brenden Fraser. I believe he was miscast. It seems as though they gave him the part because he looks so much like Frankenstein. He should have played Frankenstein and someone like Pauly Shore could have played 'Boon'. (just kidding of course!)The overall look of the film was beautiful. It had alot of style. Another problem I had with Gods and Monsters though were the doldrum periods of the plot where Whale and Boon would sit around and psycho-babble with each other and try and pick each others brains apart. They did this too many times in the film and the reluctancy of Boon was a real turn off. Brenden Fraser does play a GREAT homophobe! I also found it repulsive that Whale allowed Boon back into his life even after Boon degrated him and did nothing short of spitting in his face. Whale should have just kicked him to the curb!The part I don't understand is why Whale had such a fascination with Boon. Why did he do so much for this guy? Boon came off as such a jerk a no brains kind of guy an opportunist. Was Boon just a piece of you know what to Whale? If so that is really sad that he chose to cherish and embrace someone like Boon. That's what I didn't like about this film! The weak characters! ",3.0
" A promising movie that never finally delivers. The acting is very good most of the time. The use of a few moviestar look-alikes was fun. Brendan Fraser was ok. He could have had more depth and more presence. Ian McKellen was terrific. His devilish weak-lipped wry smile carried the film as it does in his other films. The Frankenstein myth was interpolated into a grander metaphor to some extent but not to complete satisfaction. I pretty much 'got it' by the middle of the movie and was expecting the movie to traverse some higher plateau on the back of the conflict and metaphor but it never really got there and the second half didn't add a whole lot of sparkle. I was disappointed. It didn't live up to being what I had been expecting from all the glowing reviews. Like the monster it had all the parts but there wasn't any transforming thunderclaps no touch of the gods. The ending was rather simple not at all profound and the last scene was a bit contrived even silly in an amateur film-school kind of way. I suspect others are taken with this film more by the nostalgia it conjures than by the dramatic resolution of its storyline. It's just not the great film of its reputation. It's worth watching but there are many films worth watching and many others I'd much more recommend for your time. This one you could easily go without unless maybe you're a real Frankenstein or gay buff but even then it's not sufficiently strong on either of those themes. It had great potential. It was 'close but no cigar'--or maybe that should have been Mr. Whale's line.My review update",3.0

" I hadn't read this one of Heinlein's in many many years when I picked it up and was leafing through it in search of an answer to a trivia question. Doing this with any Heinlein novel is dangerous; in short order I was snagged into re-reading the entirety of this one. Heinlein has often been cited by many of today's scientists and engineers as their inspiration for getting into the sciences and this book is a prime example of why. As the story of Matt Dodson young man in training to be a Space Patrol officer it is a very typical adolescent-to-man portrayal. The first half of the book deals with his training from the rigorous testing to eliminate those who don't have what it takes to descriptions of the myriad of subjects an officer is expected to know. The second half details his experiences and on-the-job training as a school graduate from long boring hours in space transit to the finding of a missing Patrol ship to his experiences in the art of negotiation with Venusian natives. At no point does this book ever become boring; I fully believe Heinlein could have written a twenty page exposition on watching grass grow and kept his readers totally engrossed. Some of the details he presents on the art of astrogation and space flight may go over the heads of some younger readers of this book but it is precisely such details that will get those readers interested in studying such subjects.This book was written in 1948 and some allowances must be made for that reason such as the description of Venus as mainly a hot and very wet but habitable planet (at the time he wrote this this was one of the main scientific suppositions about conditions on the this planet). At the same time it is quite incredible just how accurate he was in describing everything from rocket ship design fuels space walks space sickness space habitats eating utensils designed for space use the utility of a global peace-keeping force (such as the U.N. which was just being formed when this was written) and even predicted the use of microwaves for cooking (this prediction is hidden in a throw away one-liner comment typical for Heinlein as he quite correctly portrays the inventions of the future as mere commonplaces of their time).Some have called this a watered-down version of Starship Troopers and there is some validity to this point as there is very little of the heavy philosophy that characterized Starship Troopers here (although like all of his 'juvenile' novels there are strong threads running throughout on the importance of honesty duty personal responsibility and the proper role of government) but much of the same flavor regarding military organizations.Other than Matt himself the characterizations are somewhat one-dimensional in some cases near caricatures drawn with broad strokes. This is not necessarily bad in a book intended for young readers who have not yet reached the sophistication to see the world in many shades of gray but is a little grating for the adult readers. The depiction of Burke supposedly good enough to survive all the testing and early training for the Space Patrol but so dunderheaded as to effectively kidnap a local Venusian 'mother' and not see anything wrong with his actions is especially grating.This book was the basis for an attempt at a TV serial",3.0
" Not Heinlein's best boy's book but a good one. I hadn't read this one in many many years and it didn't hold up quite as well as the one in my memory. But at any rate in today's world a half-century after Heinlein first published this book I really appreciate how Heinlein hammered in the need to look with respect at those who are different from ourselves specifically in regard to Oz's work with the Venerians. The 360 on the 'pie with fork' lesson was great.I also like how the book's protagonist Matt isn't necessarily the sharpest pencil in the box. He works hard he tries hard he makes mistakes and he tries to do the right thing. But it's often other characters who take the stereotypical hero's spotlight. I think there's an important lesson in there that Heinlein tries to impart.As is often the case Heinlein is pretty harsh on parents especially mothers but I made a decision long ago that this is simply part of Heinlein's baggage and his many positives outweigh this negative theme.

" There aren't many operatic versions of 'Sleeping Beauty' so it was a delight to realize that the composer of 'The Pines and Fountains of Rome' had produced this charming work back in the 1920s (revised in 1933). Interest was piqued by a recent production at Spoleto (Charleston) which traveled to Lincoln Center this past summer. I didn't attend either of these productions but the reviews caught my attention and I ordered this the only recording of the work that I know of. The piece is pretty well conducted and overall well sung although the Italian diction is not as idiomatic as one would wish from this (mostly) Slovak cast. Guillermo Dominguez (Prince April) and Adriana Kohutkova (Blue Fairy/Nightengale) are standouts. It's a lovely work that certainly deserves another recording this time with plummy Italian voices that are more comfortable with Respighi's style. I have to admit that the Act III setting in the 1930s from the 'fairy tale time' of Acts I and II is something of a shock especially the appearance of an ugly American (Mr. Dollar Checques) and the 'fox trot' finale. Perhaps more sympathetic performers could have brought it off. ",3.0

" This is one of five of The Steve Miller Band's first five albums that's gotten a well deserved new mastering job. Thankfully there's no compression that makes good sounding older period music hard (or impossible) to listen to. Or any bad remixing that also destroys the original sound we all remember. The sound on this reissue is clean and fairly crisp with a bit of warmth reminiscent of the original LP mix. Is this a quantum leap in sound quality? No but it does sound good. Sound is so subjective-what one person hears as good-another hears either nothing better-or hears even worse sound.I've read that the EQ on these discs is overly bright. But I'm just wondering with new mastering using present day equipment if we're now able to hear more detail in the high end than on previous issues. That may cause some listeners to hear it as slightly brighter. Listening to the album 'Children of the Future' (with that great original LP side-long suite on 'Side One') for example I can hear much more detail on the higher end-acoustic guitars are more discernible in the background as are snippets of background vocals. But I have to say that I never thought this particular album (the original vinyl LP) sounded all that great a bit muddy sounding-even with Glyn Johns at the controls-but that may be just me. On the other hand the band's next (vinyl LP) album 'Sailor' sounded much better to my ears-again with Glyn Johns producing. As I said sound is so subjective.Since this particular album has been difficult (or impossible) to find I thought I'd choose this new edition for review along with a bit on the other four albums. The disc is snapped inside a tri-fold cardboard holder with a pocket for the 11 page booklet. The booklet has a few photographs from Miller's personal files and an essay based on a recent interview with Miller. The other new editions are similar in format.Overall this is a worthwhile album (and one of my favorites) but not the best effort by the band-now reduced to the core trio of Miller Lonnie Turner-bass/guitar/background vocals and the great Tim Davis-drums/background vocals. This is before Miller's approach changed somewhat to more pop leaning radio friendly songs and his orignal band had splintered. The core trio is augmented with the addition of either Ben Sidran or Nicky Hopkins on keyboards and Glyn Johns or Minor Wilson on guitar. Davis really shines vocally on the song 'Your Saving Grace' where his lead vocal makes you wonder why he didn't get more of a chance to sing. And check out 'Little Girl' and 'Just A Passin' Fancy In A Midnite Dream' for a bit of that old Miller Band sound. Another good song is 'Don't Let Nobody Turn You Around' but fans will have their own favorites.There's no extra tracks on this edition but the lyrics are included. But for instance the first Miller Band album does contain the song 'Sittin' In Circles' as a bonus. On first listen it doesn't seem to really fit in with the original album-the song sounds to 'poppy' and a bit lightweight but it's good to have it included. The sound on all these albums is similarly good so if you've wanted to replace your old CD copies (or couldn't find them on CD-like this particular album) this is a chance to own them with good sound and updated (but not in depth) liner notes and photos. Hopefully the price will come down some for these albums but even if that doesn't happen this is a chance to hear these albums with much more agreeable sound.I've been waiting for someone to reissue these albums with new mastering (and extra tracks-oh well) which does justice to the band's sound. I just wish that someone would release all the old period Miller Band music that's still squired away in the vaults-along with the live sets that are still hidden away-or maybe an all inclusive box set encompassing the first five albums and related studio and live tracks-maybe someday. But for now these new editions are well worth hearing. ",3.0

They whine and scream more often than not and the comic relief is painfully uncomfortable. The main character... a young new recruit... is a noise machine. If she's not screwing up she's pontificating and just won't shut up. The even bigger problem with that is she's not the loudest of the bunch.

" For those buying this Deadly China Hero dvd you are getting a [junky] version of the original film Last Hero In China. The distributors for Deadly.. are known for bootleggin movies and cutting scenes out so look for the right one if you intend to check this film out. This film is the Jet's second to the last installment to the Once Upon A Time In China (OUATIC) series. It's nothing spectacular in my opinion but it's not a bad film either. Tsui Hark who did the original OUATIC series is not a part of this film; instead the dirty Wong Jing directed this film which kind of hurt it a bit. Yuen Woo Ping still provided the choreography but I've seen better. Wong's aunt or love interest (Rosamund Kwan) is also out of this picture. Jet plays Wong Fei Hung once again and he moves his school temporarily to a new location. The school ends up next to a brothel Fei Hung soons discovers corruption and kidnappings of women taking place around the town. Officials want to get rid of him and of course Wong wants to save everybody as usual. This is probably all you'd need to know about the story because it really is not that interesting. Right from the start I could not take this film seriously at all. It was trying pretty hard to be funny and sometimes it worked other times it failed miserably. It felt like watching a parody of OUATIC. The MA were good but not great; there was simply too much wirework and fake elements involved. It's one thing if the movements look real but wirework was pretty bad in this film. There's a scene where a bad official slaps his hands on tiles and this brings them up flying at Wong; all of a sudden the official decides to literally swim or glide across the ground afterwards...couldn't help thinkin what was the point of it was but anyways. The bad official (Alan Chui?) also has one of the most annoying laughs you'll ever hear. There were bits and pieces of battles that stood out but not one ENTIRE fight scene impressed me. The Shaolin Master Killer Gordon Liu(Lau Kar Fai) was also in the film as a bad guy but director Wong Jing clearly wasted Liu's talents by not using them. In addition the outcome of his final battle is pretty pathetic. There is a fight between Liu and Jet that starts off decent until the flying elements came into play...sigh...like I said bits and pieces. Cheung Man is also in the film but her MA is strictly wire based and made her look like a ballerina...nothing impressive. As everyone already mentioned here the last battle involves Jet in a chicken suit fighting a group of baddies dressed as a centipede. It's kind of silly but the battle that follows between Fei Hung and the bad official is nice. There is still wirework done here but this battle probably had the most REAL and serious MA. Sadly there were many shots that made me realize that Jet was doubled for many of the sequences...sigh...you'll also see Jet try to use the drunken style though unconvincing and some great moves came afterwards and probably is the base of my rating. Some of the moves here are pretty brutal and they stayed in my mind even after the film. Overall I would call this an average movie. OUATIC 1-3 totally outshines this film because there was more meaning to it and I felt more for the characters plus the MA was far better. I can't really recommend you to buy this film but since it is pretty cheap why not. Besides it's part of Jet's Wong Fei Hung history. It's definitely worth checking out so you can make your own opinions. To me this film is trying too hard to be funny and sadly I found myself laughing at scenes in the film that probably weren't intended to be funny. Better Jet films are his original OUATIC 1-3 Fist of Legend (his best) Swordsman II Tai Chi Master Kung Fu Colt Master Shaolin Temple and more...hope this was helpful check out my other MA reviews thanks for reading.

" I'm not sure what movie Amazon thinks this is but it's actually a Wong Fei Hong pic starring Jet Li. And it's not his best either.

" Before reading this review you should know that this film is the same movie as 'Last Hero in China.'This film is as the title of this article proclaims an interesting combination. Combination of what you ask? It is a combination of the Historic Chinese Martial Arts extravaganza and a Tom Green movie. What makes the film interesting is that the combination is not as bad as it sounds. Jet Li once agains plays the role of Wong Fei Hung as he did in the Once Upon A Time in China historical epics but this Fei Hung is a very different character from the more serious Fei Hung (particularly in the first OUATIC) we are used to.In essence this film takes the fairly standard school versus school and style versus style conflict and extends it to a Dragon dancing competition (mirrors of OUATIC here but wait) with Jet Li's masterful Dragon dancing interrupted by a villain in a Millipede suit. Jet Li loses the initial competition due to various circumstances which include the villain's nepharious influence. Jet Li recovers and battles the Millipede in a Chicken Suit in the final battle. Chicken suit? Yes a chicken suit. I told you there was a touch of Tom Green in this movie or is it Adam Sandler? Doesn't matter.Typical of the Jet Li/Wong Jing pairing films this is a less than serious affair. If you go in expecting wonderful wuxia wire-fu and a few laughs in a no budget free for all you will have a great time. Jet Li is an amazing martial artist and somehow this film works. But if you've come looking for Fist of Legend you are in for a serious shock in this film. ",3.0

" Strictly speaking a prequel to a prequel this is the third book in the series. The first 'Hotel Transylvania' took place in mid-1700s France; the second 'The Palace' in late 1400s Italy. This one takes place in the first century of the common era in imperial Rome during the time of Nero and a bit later. There are something over a dozen books in the series all told plus a few spinoffs of books about Olivia Clemens and Madeline two of Saint Germain's lovers who become vampires themselves.The series so far has been quite good; I continue to feel somewhat guilty for not rating the books higher than I do. But there is the continuing stylistic affectation of placing a piece of correspondence after every chapter which I continue to find minorly distracting and there is a scene in this book that seems to be simply out of character as it has been so far defined for the main character. We have been given to understand that many of the traditional legends of the weaknesses of vampires such as the inability to cross running water and the inability to withstand sunlight are conditionally true in the world of Saint Germain; that is to say they are true but can be overcome so long as he stands upon his 'native soil' so he has learned to wear special shoes that are hollow and filled with soil from the land of his birth. Yet in this story when deprived of his special shoes and forced to fight giant crocodiles at midday during a blisteringly hot Roman summer day in the arena (in water) while constantly commenting on how ill and unwell this makes him feel he's still able to function well enough to slay several crocs and survive. (It's not giving away critical plot points to reveal his survival considering that he exists in the previous two books of the series both of which occur historically later than this one). He doesn't as near as I can tell even get a sunburn. This is just so far out of line that I feel the need to dock the book a star just for this one scene; otherwise the book is quite well written.If you are a fan of traditional vampire fiction you may possibly find yourself disappointed with this series; there are many elements generally found in the vampire genre that are missing from these books. But if you like historical romance or even historical fiction in general and don't object to the concept of a heroic vampire protagonist you should find this book and probably most of this series quite enjoyable.

" ***1/2'The Village Barbershop' is a modest unassuming little indie comedy set in the unusual locale of Reno Nevada.Art Leroldi (the wonderful John Ratzenberger) is the cantankerous old-school barber whose business has fallen onto such hard times that he is at risk of losing the establishment that he and his recently deceased partner have run for many years. Against his better judgment he hires a free-spirited young woman (the endearing Shelly Cole) to serve as both his accountant and fellow haircutter at the shop. At first both Art and his conservative customers have a hard time adjusting to this frightening new-world-order of gender equality but through her expertise with the scissors and the force of her personality Gloria eventually manages to win them over to her side.Given this undeniably slight storyline it's obvious that this movie was never going to exactly set the world on fire - but within the admittedly humble parameters that he's set for himself writer/director Chris Ford has succeeded in creating a sweet and amusing regional comedy filled with sparkling performances and generous dollops of local color. Ratzenberger and Cole have charm and likeability to spare and their scenes together are played with understated warmth and humor. Their performances alone compensate for the occasional overindulgence in indie-brand quirkiness and feel-good sentimentality.A minor film but an enjoyable one. ",3.0

" The film about a man who is haunted by the visions he sees. On the surface it appears to be a ghost story but it turns into the exact opposite of that. The movie is very real so expect to see what you would never see in an American film I.E. children dead or murdered. I liked the idea that 'The Uninvited' doesn't sugarcoat or sensor the events that occur. They show you so that you understand just why the characters are so broken when they recall certain events in their lives. By the title of the movie you would think 'The Uninvited' pertains to some sort of entity but really it pertains to a paranormal ability to see and experience things you would rather not.In the fashion of Korean horror this isn't something that you've seen before. The story isn't exactly predictable and problems just don't smooth themselves out. I thought this was a good film. I just assume that the name may confuse people with the American movie which this is NOT! an Asian version of.'The Uninvited' brings its own sense of eeriness that's not your typical haunted ghost story which it may seem like at first. I rated it 3/5 stars because although it's an interesting film it's also a pretty depressing film. The theme of the movie seems to be despair and the only relief from it seems to be death or suicide. The characters seem to have no real resolve to their problems other than to just 'deal with it'. I didn't like the idea so much that even though both of the characters had people around them that cared for them and wanted to help them they still felt so lonely and isolated in their issues.The ending also didn't exactly answer a simple question that I think most people wanted to know about the main character and his fiance. Might seem like it wouldn't be something to be too concerned about but the difference leads to answer another possible question. Like is he going to walk down the same road as the others effected by the paranormal powers.Overall a good film to watch but it's subject matter may not be for the sensitive. I wasn't exactly expecting them to show a child being ran over by a truck either but that's what makes the movie realistic. ",3.0

The movie does refer to the history of the wives by brief scenes that take place in Salt Lake when Brigham Young was the profit. Those scene inform the viewer as to how we came to be where we are today. It's a film-making strategy that in this case works well. Probably because those scenes aren't flashbacks.The movie adds colour to a dour book and illustrates (peoples?) the story with the multiplicity of the wives",3.0

The investigation of the owner reveals some curious facts derived from telephone bills (long distance). This leads to a Mrs. Warfield in New Orleans. A promise of a job brings her to Los Angeles (Chapter VII). This chapter gives an example of proper behavior in a job interview even one designed to investigate the applicant.

" i've been following the underground rap scene for a long time particularly project blowed and spinoffs. i've also been a fan of busdriver since his CVE days. he's always been original witty surreal intelligent and pretty damn FAST. i recently bought the import 'cosmic cleavage' which was brilliant. then i bought this album.wow. busdriver is not a happy man judging from his lyrics. he ranks on the music industry the state of indie rap rap fans(particularly the granola backpacker set he seems to attract) and most of all himself. i gave this album three stars because of its beats but honestly this is one of those un-ratable albums. this is an experiment in self-destruction a cry for help from a man that expects to drown anyways. this is deconstructing everything you or your listening audience ever thought about hiphop. this is busdriver reaching the cul-de-sac of self-referentialism. it's depressing. it's like he gained so much attention but it didn't work out and now he finds himself stuck in a genre of music that he doesn't understand anymore. that said i don't know the man personally so i can't say this is fact but it is definitely what he portray's on this disc. i can't say it is good or bad. it's an artist seeing his own reflection and having serious doubts to its own validity.buy it to support the artist but personally i haven't found it a pleasant listen lyrically. good beats though. mush records and affilliates usually come through on that end. peace.

" It was a good look at this program. It was a well done documentary and I appreciated learning some new things. How many even know about this part of the Samaritan's Purse organization? I'd never heard of it (not that I am an indicator). You can see the sacrifices and challenges that are encountered (as well as the blessings!) of the families that take these three children into their homes while the children wait to have a surgery that they could not have otherwise. The surgeries give them an extension to their lives. The youngest would not have lived for many more years if left untreated. In the process they are also given the opportunity to accept Jesus (the youngest one may not understand at the time). They can go home and share this new relationship with their families also.The documentary isn't something you will be able to `just watch' -it'll give you a case of lump in your throat if you don't just break down and cry. But at the same time there are many instances where you will smile along.This isn't something that I would normally watch and that is why I felt it was 'ok'. There isn't anything 'wrong' with it really.

" I guess agreeing with the 'big time' reviewers isn't something that I can do with this one. Winning the National Book Award is just ridiculous. Were there no other books entered in this category?This is my second Nathaniel Philbrick book (Mayflower - being the first) and I was very disappointed with it. I knew that the author likes to throw his opinion as historical fact but it wasn't as clear in Mayflower as it is in this book. It is obvious that Philbrick is mostly taking a couple of written diaries (as there are only two or three written accounts) and he milks them as much as possible. That would be okay but the constant references to other shipwrecks and disasters that have no bearing on this one bored the snot out of me. Also his constant reminder that the Donner party ate themselves (being chronologically after the time of this book) really should not have been included for any reason.Philbrick took a short story and tried desperately to turn it into a longer one. At that he was successful. The expansion of the thought process of the shipwrecked victims made it sound as if the author talked to them and put down all of their thoughts. Since we know that he did not it was overkill and misplaced in an historical nonfiction book.The number of references to things that had no bearing on the story reminds me of a high school term paper and you need to have 'X' number of references and therefore you make sure that the people reading it know that you had 'X' number of references.It is an interesting story but not very well written.

I would only recommend this book to you if you are interested in the story behind the Essex (which as I said is very well researched and detailed!) and not in the emotions! ",3.0
" This is a gripping chilling interesting true story of the sinking of the Essex whaleship. I think you can spot some thematic material and symbols waiting to be created from this story in a work of fiction. Herman Meliville did and Philbrick's book makes a good pre-reading to 'Moby Dick'.The beginning and the ending I found to be boring and dry. Those sections contain more of the historical backround and afterword.It is a great story of survival and endurance- testing the limits of the human body and psyche. If you liked this book I recommend the book 'Hatchet' which is also a survival story altough a fictional one. In the Heart of the Sea is much like the sea survival stories of 'Jaws' and the 'Perfect Storm' so I don't think there is anything special about this book. ",3.0

But I do have to admit that the way Nathaniel philbrick described the little close nit town was very descriptive. He made it seem like you were looking a photo of it. The book did give me some incite into how it was back then. How life was on the ship not seeing your family for years. After you get through the first couple of chapters the book starts to pick up. It is like you are reliving the whole experience of the sinking of the Essex. I would not recommend this book for animal lovers being one my self reading what they do to the whales and other animals just to survive made me sick. But over all it is a fairly good story. ",3.0

" Nathaniel Philbrick has done an absolutely masterful job digging out the world of the sailors on the Essex on their fateful voyage. The book is filled with detail of the day-to-day travails of the seaman & officers and interesting speculation about the relationships between major players in the drama. The book would be of particular interest to people intoxicated with the sea & sailing since there is plenty of information about how sailing & navigation was done (right & wrong by this group) in the early nineteenth century. Where I found the book to be weak is in the general history the context in which all this occurred. I prefer a book that uses an incident like this as a centerpiece to elucidate the social political economic cultural situation of the day. Philbrick does this in places particularly in the first few chapters but then the book degenerates or better said narrows its view to the Essex voyage itself abandoning the historical context. The book would have been much much longer & less focused had it taken the approach I suggest ... but it is nevertheless the approach I prefer. That is why I gave it a 3. ",3.0
" This is not a bad book but it is weighed down a bit by the numerous facts. It is good to know that it was researched entensively before being written but a little too much left in the book.

" I can't quite put my finger on it but it strikes me that there's a certain strain of superfluousness in the contemporary narrative nonfiction genre. I get the vague sense that there are all too many books coming out that are merely reheating slices of history that have been well documented but in a way that makes them more digestible to the modern reader. This National Book Award winner is a perfect example. The 'Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex' isn't exactly obscure -- Herman Melville drew upon it forMoby Dick two accounts by survivors of the actual events exist and Thomas Hefferman'sStove by a Whale",3.0
" As Nathaniel Philbrick freely admits history is replete with tales of shipwrecked castaways - and planewrecked rugger teams - eating each other. And the Essex was not the only whale boat to sink nor even was it the only one to get rammed by a whale. Nor is N. Philbrick the only man to have written about this particular ship",3.0

" First let me say I am a big fan of survival against all odds types of books. I have read and loved Alive Forever on the Mountain In Harms Way etc. This would not rank up to those standards in my opinion. Of course those three books I mentioned had a big advantage - actual survivors for the author to interview. This event took place in 1820 so the author had less to go on. All that being said if you are a fan of survival books this is worthwhile. A 3 out 5 sounds right on. ",3.0
" Much has been written (and now shown on national TV) about Philbrick's 'In the Heart of the Sea'. This short (less than 300 page) historical account of the whaleship Essex will quickly send those who are fans of the genre back to the Andes Mountains of the early 1970s in 'Alive' and the New England coastline where the hearty seamen from 'The Perfect Storm' met their fate. What separates Philbrick's writing (and ultimately makes the book interesting) is the often graphic and well-researched accounting of 1820s Nantucket and the brutal lives of the whalers who made a living by going off to sea for nearly 2 years at a time. I cannot rate the book higher only because while the storyline is compelling I did not find the story of such a unique character as to separate it from other books that deal with brutal human hardships. ",3.0
" This is the tragedy of the whaleship Essex. The same tragedy that inspired Herman Melville's very famous novel Moby Dick. Philbrick's In the Heart of the Sea situates the tale of the Essex in the history of Nantucket during the 1800s. Philbrick draws on the journals and personal testimonies of the survivors local newspapers etc. to recreate an event that had an enormous impact on American history and especially Nantucket history.The Essex set sail in 1819 to hunt sperm whales which were the most oil rich whales in the ocean. The sperm whale gets its name from the stores of clear oil located in its head which turns cloudy white when exposed to air; this oil burned clearer and brighter than any other whale oil and was in high demand. These whales could provide hundreds of gallons of oil and one successful whaling expedition could make captains and investors incredibly wealthy.About 3000 miles off the coast of South America the Essex is attacked and sunk by a vengeful sperm whale that looks to be about 80+ feet in length (double the size of the average male). In three small whale boats the 20-man crew embarks on a legendary adventure. For 93 days they are stranded facing starvation dehydration and mental deterioration.The unspeakable things that happened during those 93 days are revealed through Philbrick's assessment of the history and the literature. He unveils not only the circumstances that would lead men to cannibalism but also the circumstances that would lead men to temporarily abandon their morals and political and religious affiliations. For example in the face of starvation they sacrifice a black sailor. This sailor is the first person to be killed for food; despite their abolitionist roots the Nantucketers opt to save their fellow white sailors.Philbrick also focuses on the families of the sailors who stay behind on Nantucket as their husbands brothers fathers and sons embark on two-year expeditions. Wives see their husbands for a few months at a time only to be left for years on end. Children grow to ages two and three before they even meet their fathers.Overall the book is a fascinating history of the lives of whalers their families and their native Nantucket. The history about the island has me itching to visit! My only complaint is that the book is a little dry and the numerous quotes and embedded quotes make for slow going. I've read two books while reading this one!P.S. I've never seen the word 'sperm' so man times in my life. ",3.0
" The author of this book surely has a lot of experience with veneering but in my opinion there are better ways to do things than some of the ways he suggests. For instance he uses regular wood glue (PVA) to apply veneer by letting it dry and then using an iron to reactivate the glue. I would never trust this to hold over the long run and PVA glue is not the best kind of glue to use with veneer anyway. It is to thin and it doesn't dry to a hard glue line so it will allow the veneer to creep with seasonal changes in humidity. He also never mentions using a vacuum press. While a press might not be for beginners it is the easiest best way to veneer a flat or curved panel. ",3.0
" Some parts of this book are very educational and others so bad they are weird.As a previous reviewer notes the author's approach to vacuum pressing is to make his bag by gluing and taping two thin plastic sheets together making a bundle of more plastic sheeting around a [garden?] hose to make the connection valve and then connecting the hose to a wooden block covering the intake port on his air compressor (Don't try this at home; constricting the intake port on many piston driven compressors can screw up the valves). He reports that 'real' vacuum presses are expensive and he finds vacuum pressing not terribly effective...If you've never veneer vacuum pressed before you might not recognize that as the hominid precursor approach. I'm surprised he shows use of a veneer hammer instead of the more cost effective stone club method. For a lot of (better) info on vacuum pressing google up the Joewoodworker website.As others have noted some of his approaches to glue preparation are a bit odd as well. Coating with thinned wood glue and then ironing to heat activate... I suppose you could do it that way I'm just at a loss as to why you would want to. There are several other approaches and glues that bond better are less mess to handle and generally produce better results. 'Course if you bought a load of past its prime Tite-Bond at discount I guess it would make sense (and be consistent with his vacuum press).Some good stuff some just flat out weird.

The Series3 was not able to connect to establish the wireless connection. I did follow the troubleshooting steps that came with the adaptor but I think it is possible that the adaptor was too close to the wireless router. In other words the adaptor might have worked just fine if I had the TiVo Series3 box further away from the wirelss router. Since I had a hardline available on the wireless router I plugged the Series3 into the router directly using CAT5 cable and the Series3 connected with no trouble after that. I'm not guessing about the adaptor being too close to the wireless router; in another wireless setup I read that the wireless device might not receive the wireless signal if it was too close to the wirelss router.

There are many good 802.11g USB network adapters available on the market at affordable prices but you'll find the TiVo series 2 DVR is not compatible with most of them. I really think TiVO should update the network technology of their box. They're way behind. I settled on the TiVo Wireless G USB network adapter because it was one of the few that works perfectly with my TiVo but it does not support security features that I really wish it did support. For example the only wireless security it supports is WEP encryption. It does not support WPA at all. And by the way if you decide to use WEP encryption make sure you use a Hex key not an ASCII key. When I tried to set it up using a 128-bit ASCII key it would not connect to the wireless network at all.

I was hoping to get better reception but after plugging this adapter to my TiVo Series 3 the signal strength went down from 'Very Good' on the linksys B to 'Good' and sometimes 'Marginal' with the TiVo G. I was a little disappointed to see that this pricey adapter has a weaker antenna than my 5 year old B adapter. I'm typing this review from my laptop next to the adapter which is currently getting excellent signal strength.

I did not have the problem one other reviewer had our tubes were inserted thank God. The 'squeals with delight' is out and out false advertising. The other reviewer was correct... it's a dog squeak toy sound. Really a company of Zapf's caliber should know better. I think people who purchased this doll should be given a rebate. Anyone interested in sending a petition to Zapf and Amazon regarding this blatent lie regarding this product? I should have guessed no batteries would indicate no real sound functions but I've seen Zapf pull off some great features with dolls in the past and thought because of the eyes there had to be some gimic with this doll as well. One additional complaint regarding this doll... the clothes are astronomically expensive to buy (real baby clothes are cheaper!) and yet the outfit the doll comes with is poorly made and not that nice looking guilting parents into the purchase of at least one decent outfit for the doll. My solution... do a web search there are free sewing patterns out there for doll clothes that will fit this doll. Shame on whoever claimed this doll 'squeals with delight'. ",3.0
" This album is misleading because it's just Ponty's best from 1987 - 1991. I much prefer his material from 1975 - 85 in which he focused on the violin and not the electronics he's dabbling with these days. But because this is the best of three studio albums it makes for a fairly strong regular release and saves you from the crap. I enjoyed this more than I thought. Grover Washington is on one track and the final song is a wonderful piece by Chopin. But the bottom line is if you ever purchase a Ponty album make sure it's on Atlantic Records not Epic unless you have all the Atlantic albums. ",3.0
" First take this CD for what it's worth not by the standards set before and after it. So it's not '461' or 'Slowhand.' That's not necessarily a bad thing. Like Neil Young. Clapton didn't always put out albums for their top 40 value. On the contrary. Particularly at this point in his career Clapton had earned some license- for better or worse depending on who you ask- to do some things he wanted to do and let the Billboard charts be danged. Yet despite that he could still spit out songs that garnered radio play like 'Carnival' and 'Hello Old Friend' two of my favorite Clapton songs. Also like Young as well as Dylan Clapton was partial to using one of the several lush sporadically used female background singers of the time. In this case that voice is Marcy Levy who if her voice were absent from the song 'Beautiful Thing' it wouldn't be as smooth or melodic. In fact Clapton was so comfortable with his stature at this point in his career that he allowed Levy to sing solo in the song 'Innocent Times' as he played in the background to churn out what is in my opinion the best song on this CD. It's a real Levy tour de force albeit a brief one. For that reason itself this CD's worth buying. And while 'Sign Language' is hardly the best collaboration between 2 star recording artists it's actually a decent song consistent with this CD's tone and unmistakenly Clapton and Dylan. But also typical of albums/CDs of this time they weren't chock full of hits from beginning to end. So what makes this CD or even this era different from that of today? With rare exceptions many big name artists have CDs that contain some grizzle. Future Clapton CDs would have slicker production quality particularly after Phil Collins produced CDs put Clapton's name back in the spotlight in the early 80s. After that Clapton became something of an video darling but did that necessarily mean he produced better songs? Purely subjective. Try this CD. I challenge you to not find some appeal in it. I bet you find yourself humming at least a couple of the tunes. I dare you to admit you didn't find your toe tapping to a couple tunes. And I especially bet you find yourself wondering what else did Marcy Levy record worth listening to. I know I did. ",3.0
" 'No Reason To Cry' is in my opinion one of Claptons weakest albums next to 'Another Ticket'. The whole thing is a sloppy mess with weakdisjointed playing no cohesion or direction and much slurring from Eric on lead vocals. Where are the producers on this album? I wonder sounds like they were 'out to lunch' on most of it or maybe flat on their backs on the floor! However Marcy Levy wrote and performed well on the track 'Innocent Times'. Rick Danko Richard Manuel Bob Dylan Georgie Fame and Ron Wood make guest appearances that don't really add much of anything to the entire mess. To be fair There are a couple of OK tracks such as 'Beautiful Thing' 'Carnival' 'Hello Old Friend' and the Bob Dylan penned 'Sign Language'. His filler blues cover 'Double Trouble'and Rick Danko song 'All Our Past Times'(Both songs are covered much better in Clapton's live 1980 album 'Just One Night'.) are very good. In 'All Our Past Times' there are the follwing lyrics 'All our past times should be forgotten All our past times should be erased.' makes me think so should the master tapes of this 1976 half effort.

" 'No Reason to Cry' is one of Eric Clapton's lesser orginial studio albums. The problem is in the material which is simply not up to the incredibly high standards of Clapton 1970s masterpieces such as '461 Ocean Blvd.' and 'Slowhand.' That's not to say the album is awful. In fact there is hardly a bad song in the mix. It just doesn't live up to expectations. For example the Clapton-Bob Dylan collaboration on the song 'Sign Language' is pleasant enough but is not the masterpiece you would expect from these two music giants.Overall 'No Reason to Cry' should be primarily of interest to Clapton's ardent fans. Casual listeners should start with one of the two albums listed above or one of his anthology albums instead. ",3.0
" I'm a git player over 35 years and love EC. This release on his comeback trail in '76 is not much to get happy about. Reports circulated at the time of these recording sessions had found EC drinking very hard and surrounded by the same type of musicans involved. Ex Herion addicts usually go to Alcohol to relieve the JUNK pain from Herion. It is no reason that this release fell on deaf ears when first issued. EC's playing is stiff and mediocre. Even the bonus track added on the CD 'LAST NIGHT' does not leave you filled or do any justice. He is stiff on all his git work on this album. A shame. Maybe I'm just to critical but others felt the same way. judging by the cover of EC in a bar with bottles of liquor in front of him answers these downer gaps. ",3.0

" As a ShoDan assistant instructor of Shiho Karano Kenpo Karate I strive to educate myself about the martial arts. I've found some good books on the subject and I'm always on the lookout for more. Since 'The Karate Dojo' has been in print since 1967 I figured it must provide valuable direction. It does mainly by portraying a snapshot of martial arts history that challenges the budo practitioner to forsake mediocrity for mastery and character.The book has three basic parts. First the author provides a somewhat Karate-centric view of martial arts facets such as the dojo belt ranking systems and character self-analysis. In the second section are a number of martial arts parables that teach through historical narrative. Finally Sensei Urban uses the last chapter to discuss the 'contemporary' Karate scene (i.e. the mid-1960s). The overall theme is one of extreme discipline and perseverance within the martial arts necessary to achieve a seemingly mystical level of physical mental moral and spiritual ability. In other words it takes hard work and commitment to become a 'weaponless weapon.''The Karate Dojo' is a quick read - I finished it in less than a day. There are a number of stylized line drawings and black-and-white photographs to complement the text. It's a portrait of an era in Karate that seems to be almost mythical - and mostly lost at least in the West. The author fondly discusses harsh daily training under the strict discipline of a revered master in a dojo where everyone's practically family. I've tasted some of that but nothing close to what Sensei Urban describes. And that's where I differed with the author. Yes optimal mastery of any activity requires the type of commitment he advocates and that's OK for some. But I believe it's possible to benefit from a consistent and disciplined practice of the martial arts without making an all-consuming religion out of it.At any rate despite some dated aspects and a monkish focus on martial arts that may be beyond what many would bear 'The Karate Dojo' contains worthwhile insights for the martial artist. If nothing else its high standards may challenge one to take their current commitment and practice to a higher level. ",3.0

" This book though poorly written has a story to tell though it could have been better told by someone who knows how to write. It is however an easy quick read and moderately interesting. It does have some merit in as much as it chronicles the author's ascent of Denali.Most of the book is spent recounting the time during which she and her team mates were trapped on Denali at 14000 feet caught in one of the most severe storms on record which saw eleven people perish. Her description of the horrendous weather conditions and sub zero temperatures which pinned her team down for a period of about two weeks is graphic though repetitious. She was lucky to have been with two experienced guides who knew what they were doing. This is undoubtedly one of the main reasons she and her team mates survived their ordeal.Disconcerting are her repeated racist references to Asian climbers. Her comments are unworthy and make her sound ignorant. It cannot help but affect one's opinion of her and that opinion is unflattering.

Well being someone that is over weight and has a problem with determining what an actual serving is poses a HUGE problem.

Perhaps George Washington L'Enfant and the early capital architects were into astrology I don't know. Perhaps the sign Virgo has some supernatural significance for the well being of the capital and the country I don't know.

The book moves slowly the author did his research and I have no quibble with that - I know this topic; however the significance of why the Freemasons chose to do things that have been done in the manner that they did is just not revealed I was really disappointed because there is some terrific information out there and I am well versed in this topic based on my own research. I am wondering if this is because he wasn't allowed to 'get to the point' no pun intended. I think the true reason he left out answers to why (Astrology is important but he didn't say why among other points never addressed is because Mason's aren't allowed to share the key precepts of their faith or beliefs to the uninitiated - that leaves out all females and many men.There are many good books out there to understand the significance of Masonry -you won't find them by doing an internet search using the word - avoid the publications that will come up will give you books written by Masons (who often don't share that information up front) these books reveal much of the same stuff rehashed instead try books by William Schnoebelen John Ankerberg David Weldon Tom C.

" Ever wonder why the city of Washington D.C. was an explicitly designed city but the streets are laid out in a seemingly illogical manner? Wouldn't you design a simple grid pattern for a city instead of the bizarre pattern found there?David Ovason attempt to give meaning to this street pattern and for some of the architecture found in the city. His analysis is brilliant but I find myself wandering in the sometimes meandering pattern of his investigation just like the layout of the city. It would probably help for the reader to have a background in astrology/astronomy to give greater meaning to this analysis for I often found myself scratching my head.It was interesting to learn that Pierre L'Enfant the French Freemason given credit for the design of the city was later sacked from the construction team for criticism of some of the builders for messing up his design. He would later go broke wander around the city and pester congress for a greater share of payments that he thought were his for the design of the city. He died broke and is buried near Arlington House. ",3.0
" As one who works in the Capitol I was intrigued by the title. I bought this book many years ago and recently got around to finishing it. David Ovason is a well-educated man and has written a very thought provoking book.He sets out to prove that Washington D.C. was designed and built largely by Masonic architects. And this is true. But he gives many facts and footnotes to support this.It is a well-known fact that Benjamin Franklin was a Mason along with architect James Hoban (who designed the White House) Presidents Garfield and Polk and Statue of Liberty sculptor Frederic Bartholdi.And although textbooks teach that the federal city was the brainchild of French engineer Pierre-Charles L'Enfant Ovason argues that Washington Jefferson U.S. Surveyor General Andrew Ellicott and others modified L'Enfant's original blueprint. I think the author makes a great case but I got lost several times because I could not keep up with it all. Many facts here!Masonic symbolism appears in the marble plaster concrete glass and paint facades of the Federal Reserve the Library of Congress and other landmarks. This book the result of a decade of thought and research establishes the plausibility of Ovason's theory. I appreciated the time that went into it.This work looks at the Capitol the Washington Monument city planning and the numerous zodiacs located throughout the city.

" As a countertenor I am always searching for recordings from new and up and coming singers. I had heard some wonderful things about this album and decided to buy it. It was very interesting to hear 11 differnet versions of the famous Ave Maria Text and I believe that the contrast and pacing of the album is excellent. My sole fault lies in the vocal production of this young singer. MOST of his range is sheer and glittering. He has a lovely tone and clean projection and resonance. Like many countertenors the sound at the bottom of the range takes on a rather covered sound at times but this is characteristic of the voice and is not terribly distracting most of the time. In matters of vibrato everyones taste varies but there are moments when the vibrato is a bit wider and unstylistic than might be generally appropriate. Unfortunately like many singers with rare voice types who feel the need to 'prove' themselves to an often difficult public he decided on several occasions to pass the tessitura at which his voice sounds natural and unforced. I can sing to a soprano Db but I would never do so in public performance or on a recording because I can acknowledge that there are parts of my voice that are better left in the rehearsal studio and left OUT of the recording studio. All in all this is NOT a BAD album. The material is rich and interestingly arranged by the production team and nearly of the vocals are clean and pleasant. Just beware of the top notes when the range is more suited to Dramatic Soprano than for Lyric Countertenor. ",3.0

" In the age of overdeterming macroeconomic factors ETFs high frequency trading hedge funds etc. technical analysis is a total waste of time for the average Joe sitting at his workstation trying to day trade. For every chart that shows a meaningful pattern there are 5 that show no pattern at all. The technician out of necessity of his methodology is forced to make meaning of a chart which is likely just a random collection of observations. Just because a price happened to bottom or top twice consecutively at the same point doesn't mean that there's 'support' or 'resistance' at that level. Sometimes there are legitimate support and resistance levels but more often than not those are illusory. Support or resistance levels evaporate and reset all the time.Fundamental analysis puts the investor in a much better position to actually succeed in my opinion. Earnings price book value growth forward earnings debt levels etc. are not subject to any interpretation. They are what they are. It might take any given stock a long time for it to align w/ its fundamental valuation but the relative predictability that one sees in P/E levels for different types of businesses of varying sizes and growh prospects makes the fundamental school the more rational approach.Also anyone who believes that markets are 'efficient' hasn't paid much attention to markets.

" There is an old adage that two are better than one. But not according to Lydia Sanderson a stiff and awkward pioneer woman of the 1890's who left Pennsylvania after her husband died to make a stake in northeast Oregon country and the Blue Mountains. Fiercely independent and willing to face the hardships of living alone on a remote mountainside this story by Molly Gloss is based on original journals of the time and painstakingly accurate in its details of the area.The theme--women can be independent and do it as well or better than men--is a popular one in these modern times though its spin gives me pause. Was this really so strongly portrayed in those days? To the author's credit however she did at times give a hint of Lydia's loneliness. 'I shall not see Evelyn Walker now nor any other woman until the Spring and must harden my heart not to be Lonely.'Gloss's plain and homespun style of writing wove a pleasing tale. It made me want to unravel her story until the end. She has a rare ability to detail the mundane while twining together different story lines in a unique way. Her realism made me believe she knew her setting well--albeit often painting it in shades of gray with words like dull and sooty. (I live in these mountains. When it came to her descriptions of the weather and the poverty of the times she nailed it!)In the end however I was left unsatisfied feeling a certain hopelessness and fatalism. I found myself wishing Lydia Sanderson would indeed find that soul mate even pathetic Tim Whiteaker her male suitor who could at least make her life somewhat easier.

" Pirates of the Caribbean At World's End is without a doubt the best looking Pirate game I have ever seen! And so it is to my utmost disappointment that the gameplay does not make use of such outstanding artwork. This 'T' for Teen rated game follows the movie plot of Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest and the newly released Pirates of the Caribbean At World's End. The game takes players to many of the locations found in the two movies such as Port Royal Tortuga Isla Cruces Singapore Davy Jones' Locker and of course the Black Pearl and the Flying Dutchman. Unfortunately little to no room is given to explore or interact with these magnificent looking environments. Instead the game sends the player from one un-imaginative fight into the next while collecting random objects for extra rewards along the way. Some jumping and balancing sections try to mix things up but even these activities quickly become repetitive. Pirates requires absolutely no thinking because only one objective can be completed at a time and only one predefined path can be taken. The game offers two different Multiplayer games where players can duel each other in a sword fight or battle in splitscreen mode with or against each other to defeat enemies. Overall Pirates of the Caribbean At World's End is (another) mediocre movie tie-in action game. Leaving a lot of potential but no follow through. ",3.0
" This product is a double negative. It's so bad it's good. That might seem strange but I'll explain why in a minute.This video games retells the events in the last two Pirates of the Caribbean movies. However if you're serious about the story skip this. This video game doesn't retell the story very accuratly. Only half of the plot details happened in the movie.As for graphics I agree with the other reviewers. The animation is not glitchy and looks very nice. However Jack Sparrow's peculiar movements looked more entertaining in the movie. In this game Jack Sparrow looks over animated; like he's too drunk to stand up (but miraculously talk straight). Other than that nice graphics. For a game developed for a fast release it certainly looks pretty.Now we get to the big question. Gameplay... The gameplay is seriously boring. Serious video gamers will be un-entertained and would rather play Halo. However people who have had bad days will love this game. If you want a game that is easy to play and win you can play this. If you've overworked your brain in the office you can come home and let this game play itself for you. This game is a stress reliever.If you're a serious video gamer than done bother renting this. However if you do get a copy save it for a very miserable day. ",3.0
" I bought this game on xbox 360 because I had a lot of fun playing it with my sister on wii. It is not the same. I found it was difficult and boring. The graphics are better on 360 and that was kind of cool but I am not even sure if its the same storyline. I know for sure there are things in the xbox version I never saw on the wii (and vis versa). I recommend renting this first to see if its your kind of thing or not. Don't waste the money without trying it out. ",3.0
" Pirates of Carribean is a moderatly fun game with richly detailed graphics in third person viewpoint. The weak part about the game is the combat. The attacks performed by your character (J.Sparrow) J.Depp and later on in tandem with Orlando Blooms Character are pretty simple button mash combo sequence. You can press A for sword attack and X for punch attack .Also after filling up a portion of your finish meter you can perform a finishing kill by pressing the buttons that will flash on the screen to do a finish move you will see a prompt on screen telling you which button to press in sequence to perform a finish kill. Which always starts as Hold LT then the press or hold the corisponding button prompted on screen. Like this for example Hold LT. then press Y hold B. Or sometimes just hold Y . Whatever is on the screen ..very simular to Spiderman-3 button mashing cutscenes. The only problem with this is its way too easy to just kill an enemy by just pressing A (sword slash) over and over too kill about 90% of the enemies. While the other 10% require at least one finish kill to eliminate them. You also have a handgun with (get this) 3 bullets.woo hoo!! So authentic to that era..lol.you can kill an enemy with your eyes closed because of the auto-aim hold LT. ... The A.I. is horribly easy to kill. One time I tested out to see if an enemy would hit me at all. And he just stood there circling me without even hitting me or even trying anything at all and I was right in front of him finally I just pressed A three times and he was dead Lame very Lame. And these same enemies repeat themselves over and over with some of them waiting there turn too fight me. Anybody who played ERAGON? well its nearly the same here in this game. With Pirates only being slightly less lame....Another combat form is when you meet a boss type character you go into 'DUEL' mode . The camera switches into side scroll mode simular to Mortal Combat. But thats where the comparison ends . There's 3 Circles on the left or right of the combatant . One being a high attack oNe representing a mid attack and one representing a low attack. Now get this when the circle turns grey its telling you in advance how the fighter is going to attack you so you can successfully block the attack (how polite) so if you see the upper circle turn grey you push left stick up. And if you make a successful block it will turn green .Or red if you dont. Well this feature takes away the fun out of it as your constantly looking at the 3 circles more than the fighters. Which makes it unbeliveable lame . Its nothing like Soul Caliber or a Mortal Combat at all. There are some great features about this game which are the graphics are pretty darn good. Some of the towns reminded me of Oblivion. And there are some great fog and lighting effects. And the cutscenes look quite good.The levels are pretty much straight forward linear with a little back-tracking here and there. There are some puzzly type things like you play an organ in a certain sequence to get Davy Jones's key. Its pretty much kindergarden-1st grade puzzles. Kids up too 13 will probably LOVE this game as the combat is very Eragon-ish. But at least the camera is fully controlable so there's no fighting characters off screen. The only side scroll is the easy as pie boss 'duels' . Johnny Depp character looks incredibly good . As well as the squid guy and the hammer head guy . The graphics are a very strong point in this game.Another nice thing is you can switch between Jack Sparrow and Orlando Bloom in combat and control both fighters. Another nice thing is the soul trap sword its a flaming green sword that traps enemies souls for whatever eason other than achievement points and high scores postings on LIVE . I hope there is a cheat soon where I could play the entire game with a flaming sword because it only lasts for a short period and to recharge it you have to find and collect mummified heads. Also you can climb certain wallsropesladdersships masts when prompted too which is pretty nice. It is a somewhat decent game in the adventure part but the easy as pie enemies will have hardcore gamers wishing for more but the kiddes will love this game. Would I buy it? Nope. Only if I had young kids. ",3.0

" The authors have done reasonably well in presenting general design/architecture issues in the area of object relational database management systems.Poor editing however abounds in this book. The reader must wade through paragraphs of opinionated comments distracting (and often incorrect) pontifications and complaints. For example hardware designers are roundly chastized for failing to support Multics-style protection-ring logic in today's microprocessors.The text is heavily sprikled with superlatives such as 'explosive' 'incredible' 'astonishing' etc. It is irritating from a reader's perspective to be digging out good technical material betweeen snippets of pro-Informix marketing hype.When not engaged in hype the authors sometimes make curious and possibly false assertions. In one instance they claim that Wal-Mart's huge data warehouse is utilized to 'rotate stock'.

" I am reviewing the 1st edition.Dr. Stonebraker is a pioneer in the field of object-relational database management systems (ORDBMS). He writes with confidence and clarity; he knows the subject matter because he was one of the early innovators. The book is mercifully short and to-the-point. It is well organized and it includes an index references short code samples and plenty of diagrams.The book assumes you have some background and experience with existing relational database management systems and SQL. It would also help if you have some basic understanding of implementation details like B-tree indexes and cost-based query optimizers. You should also have an understanding of OO concepts like inheritance and polymorphism and some experience with an OO language like C++ Eiffel Java or Smalltalk.Armed with this background the book is an excellent overview of the motivation architecture design and features of ORDBMS. I especially liked the chapters on SQL parsing and query optimization and also the discussions of how inheritance affects query and trigger processing.If you've never been exposed to the ideas and concepts of 'object-relational' this is an excellent starting point. If you have the background described above you will be able to read this book in a few sittings and come away with a basic - albeit incomplete - understanding of the field of ORDBMS.I say 'incomplete' because Dr. Stonebraker fails to write about the dark side of ORDBMS. For example once pointer-like references are introduced the system runs the risk of 'dangling pointers'- precisely the kind thing a purely relational system elegantly avoids. This issue is never once mentioned and yet I know for a fact it is a danger that must be dealt with on one commercial implementation I have used. There are other issues to be confronted and understood. C.J. Date has written extensively on the subject. Although C.J. Date's writing is sometimes long-winded and pedantic you won't truly understand the ORDBMS topic until you've read what he has to say.The book is also a compelling marketing promotion for the product once sold by Stonebraker's now-defunct company. Given the 'feature matrices' and other comparisons in the text it is clear that his product was the hands-down winner at the time the book was written. This is all ancient history however. The book shows its age and bias. First of all Stonebraker's company Illustra (later renamed Informix) was recently acquired by IBM. Secondly very little is said about Oracle which has since implemented a very respectable OR system of its own. Lastly most of the other vendors he mentioned have fallen completely off the radar map. These days all the database vendors have most of their attention turned towards XML and raw OLTP throughput. So it seems like 'The Next Great Wave' predicted by Stonebraker never fully materialized. Perhaps the 2nd edition of the book has updated the vendor list and features matrices.I wish more was said about his early work on the 'POSTGRES' system. If you're interested you can find out much more about POSTGRES and its open-source offspring PostgresSql by using any Internet query engine. There is now a whole cottage publishing industry built up around PostgresSql. If you want to experiment and explore ORDBMS PostgresSql may be a good choice.Based on what I can see in the table of contents the 2nd edition doesn't include too much new material. Dr. Stonebraker has added a chapter on application servers. I know from his other work that he argues that middle-tier application servers are wrong-headed because business logic should reside in the database itself - where it is physically close to the data.I rate the 1st edition of the book 3 stars because (1) It is dated (2) No space is allotted to the problematic issues of ORDBMS (3) 'The Next Great Wave' never seemed to take off as predicted.Nevertheless it is a worthwhile and useful book to read if you are interested in the topic. The 2nd edition will surely have an up-to-date comparison of the ORDBMS vendors as of 1999. ",3.0
" While the first and third books in the trilogy are good exposure to the Halo Universe the second is an almost complete failure as a novel. It does have its few redeemable qualities but any 'scene' featuring the Master Chief or an event in the game feels mostly forced. It's like the author played the game through on easy recorded what he did and fleshed it out to make the central plot line. Pretty much every part that the author had to come up with on his own is good but when considered as part of the whole it's just.... Not good fiction.The other two books are good in their own ways.I would suggest purchasing the books if you're interested in Halo. ",3.0
" All three of the stories were written well and the plots unfolded in riviting fashion as one who had played the game would expect. However with that said I must state that one of my primary expectations weren't met or even addressed.At the end of the first Halo game we see 343 Guilty Spark tooling through space apparently unharmed from the final cataclysm that befell Halo. We also were left with the impression from various pieces of dialog through the game that like Neo (Matrix) the Master Chief (Reclaimer) had been down this road before.While I hadn't expected the prequel The Fall of Reach to provide much in terms of explanation of these open items I did have full expectations that these items would be either more fully developed or even explained in the sequel First Strike. Disappointingly none of the open items from the first Halo were discussed.It would have been appreciated if the Amazon Review had made mention of this crtical ommission beforehand. I might well have still purchased the Trilogy but now I feel a bit cheated. ",3.0

" This album was the first I heard from Sparta. The songs are each powerful in their own respect and Sparta truly has a sound of their own. They touch on the emo/screamo genre often but are not afraid to branch out and try some off the wall stuff. However I found the songs to be redundant and often repetitive this record does grow on you though. Favorites of mine include 'End Moraine' 'Splinters' and 'Lines in Sand'. I would also like to say that I prefer Sparta over Mars Volta. ",3.0
" I would have given this record three and a half stars but amazon won't let me. Ok so when i first picked this up it didn't really do too much for me. I mean it sounded like Sparta but was no where near as varied or experimental as Wiretap Scars. I kinda left it for a few days after only giving it about 2 listens. For some odd reason i felt like giving it another chance to sweep me away. And that it finally did. It takes a bit of getting used to but sparta has made a cohesive album of gut-wrenching powerful and emotional songs. You can definately tell these guys are giving it all they've got and thats what really counts. I've been listening to this record nonstop now for last 3 days and its quickly becoming one of my personal favourites. I find though that its better not to compare it to Wiretap Scars because then you would be missing the point. I beleive Sparta is continually trying to re-invent themselves and releasing another record of the same material would not do this. Porcelain is an alotgether beautiful and emotionally charged record that will definately take you on a ride as long as you're willing to let it. ",3.0
" My friend bought the album. I listened to it today at work. It was .. bland.Coming from Sparta I was surprised. There were a few good parts. The opening song itself led me to high hopes and 'Lines in the Sand' is also impressive and different. However I give this album 3 stars for a few reasons.One the album itself looks like it was made to be returned. The font used for the album cover is reminiscent of something that would be found on an N'sync album. Okay I can overlook that. The artwork however .. what artwork is there? Just whiteness with pictures of the band members. Okay I can overlook that too right?I read the lyrics. They aren't impressive at all. Basic words in their expected orders. This is where I began to frown upon the album. However I kept a tad bit of hope.Then I stuck the cd in my player. Within about 6 songs or so I was done. I had heard it before. It was the normal thing. A few good guitar patterns here or there something experimental every now and then. But overall it was just .. normal. The only thing that seemed to give the album an edge was the vocals. That and a few very nice moves in the structuring of the songs.Other than that not much impressed me. ",3.0

Wiretap overpowers this release. Just my opinion. ",3.0

" When I saw the video for 'Stick 'Em Up' I was taken in by the song's catchiness as well as the fact that the video features the lead rapper in a boxing match! So I went out and bought the CD not knowing whether or not the risk was worth it...Well I've listened to the CD a few times already and all I can say is that if you like the Beastie Boys and Rage Against The Machine then you'll love Quarashi. However the Icelandic foursome doesn't quite match up to the aforementioned bands if you know what I mean. The Beasties had developed wit and cleverness in their lyrics and music while Rage had an intense passion and focus in their music. Quarashi could use some improvement in their lyrics and sound. Like I said before it's not all that bad but their music and lyrics come across as slightly corny and juvenile at times (i.e. 'Your mother is a stripper' or 'I come on the mic like a fascist' (or something like that)? Please!) Still I definitely see potential in this band and I believe they can be a much better band given time. After all it's only their debut album. Heck look at the Beastie Boys. They've definitely come a long way since 'Licensed To Ill'! ",3.0
" Being a fan of rap/rock you have to imagine my reaction to Quarashi when I first heard them... There aren't enough mainstream rap/rock bands out there so every time I hear a new band like this I look at it as a rare indulgance. First off the first song I heard was Mr. Jinx and I was unimpressed by the facts that the hook was the only thing pulling the song together and the weak lyrics weren't helping. It was recently while playing a game for PS2 called Amplitude that I heard the song Baseline and I really enjoyed it.While doing some research on the band I was upset to find that the band consisted of four regulars three rappers and a drummer who sometimes used a drum machine. In all honestly a lot of the songs on this CD aren't bad but I've yet to find anything other than Baseline and Stick Em' Up really extroadinary. Don't get me wrong these guys are pioneering what's left to be explored of rap/rock but by doing so they're trying out a lot of things that really don't work that well and to make things worse the variety makes for a painful album because there's nothing you can really get into without hewaring something different a little later.So I've made it clear that Quarashi is no Rage but some of their songs are worth listening to. These guys still need to find their niche and for christsakes learn how to play their own instruments. ",3.0

" Even though I read 30-odd pages of Communion before coming to the conclusion that it was just a little to far-fetched I thought I'd see what the movie had to offer. Well to be quite honest it did nothing to convince me that my initial conclusion from the book is unjustified. Are we seriously supposed to believe that aliens who apparently have the ability to visit our planet from great distances have such impracticle body structures and that they've come all this way simply to[...] probe Earthlings? I'm by no means a sceptic when it comes to this topic and am willing to give anyone the benefit of the doubt so long as their story isn't completely absurd--which is the case with Communion.The DVD contains a very short clip of the surgical removal of a supposed alien implant from some guy's arm. This may sound sensational but it most certainly is not. Not surprsingly we are not allowed a close-in look at this 'alien implant' and no less surprising the clip ends with a statement to the effect that the nature of the 'device' has yet to be determined. And I'm sure that it has since been 'mysteriously' lost so we'll never know what it was. Isn't that just always the case? ",3.0

" The movie'Communion'which is based on a contoversial New York Times bestseller by the same name is in no respects as convincing as the novel written by author Whitley Strieber. Strieber's novel and movie both tell the 'true' story of his personal encounters with apparent aliens which Strieber has coined the term 'visitors' when refering to them. The movie lacks in several departments. One obviously is the budget(or lack there of) which takes away from the movies ability to portray realistic aliens or visitors or whatever they are. The aliens which are now easily recognized by there large black eyes in modern American pop culture look in this movie quite literally like cheap rubber balloons.(probably because that's what they are)Strieber's book however does not have the need for cheesy props to convey his story in convincing detail; probably the reason people had an interest in his book back in 1987. Ask anyone thoughwho has read his next several books on the same subject; if they are capable of thinking logicallythey will most likely tell you about the steady flow of contradictions ever present in his writing.This brings us to a second flaw in the movie which is",3.0

I don't recall much of the book being anything like the movie. There are no explainations to the visual circus that is happening on the screen. The movie really left me scratching my head.

" Let me begin this review by stating that I am a huge fan of Christopher Walken. OK I'm done. Do yourself a huge favor and buy the VHS version of this movie. The director's cut is so bad in places it's cathartic. At the very least it's enough to make you want to wash your brain out with soap and Walken's as well.I bought this because it is supposed to be one of Walken's finest works and it truly is. He is such a sensitive honest actor that even the most miserable script flows like water across his performances. I think he's a national treasure and like national treasures subject to horrific abuse. This movie unequivocally abuses Christopher Walken and lends credence to the rumors that the actor suffered a breakdown of sorts in his 40s. Just watch the out-takes of him cavorting in the most explicitly banal ways with plastic jumpy things that vaguely resemble a very bad joke by Arthur C. Clarke.ONCE you climb back down from the walls and IF this DVD survives a well deserved fling across the room and a naughty chuckle you may want to watch it again. This is not a joke. You spent money on this DVD you deserve to get something out of it. IF you discount the whole alien nonsense and view it from the perspective of a man coming to grips with a disintegrating mind complete with cheesy special effects (as most maudlin breakdowns entail) it really is quite good. Toss Whitley Streiber his wife and kid WATCH Walken as he rationalizes all this bizarre information in his intensely personal performance which is extraordinary. Read your own meaning into it achieve what you want and see a truly gifted actor dance perilously close to the edge of madness. ",3.0

" Is Strieber insane. Or is he making this crazy account up to sell books and inspire films? I'll have to say yes to the latter. However don't let that dissuade you from a creepy film like Communion. Although the plot is VERY disjointed there are very distubing scenes. Have you ever felt like an alien creature was creeping into your bedroom as you slept? Well you will after seeing a scene that depicts exactly that. Memorably disturbing scenes of this nature give this otherwise uninteresting film a decent shelf life. ",3.0

So I found the book and read it.Here is my comments and summary.I was amazed to learn that we were not doing to good economical in the 1700s. England got mad at us because we were no longer doing things they hoped America wouldso we went our way and they went thiers.America started declining in economics because we no longer had the machinery that England had supplied us with. We kept declining because we no longer knew how to do anything independantly. Suddenly we could grow cotton! Pulling the seeds out of the cotton was hard labor and the colonists could only produce 1 pound a day. Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin to make the labor of picking seeds out of cotton easier. He was not very good at reading but doing figures was easy.This helped him majorly in inventing the cotton gin and many other inventions. If you are interested in America's struggle for economics in thr 1700sI would highly recommend this great book. ",3.0

" It's a little gem of a book ~~ one I've had in my bookcases for a long time. This past weekend with everyone in my family struggling with the stomach flu ~~ I picked it up to read it as I needed something light and easy to read. It is a lovely insight in a family of three women of three generations. It's mostly about Charlie the midwife and all-around nurse. Her daughter Sophia and granddaughter Margaret were secondary characters but their stories are just as charming.Charlie grew up poor. She married the river ferryman. After their daughter Sophia was born they moved inland. Charlie kept her midwife practice going and soon her husband abandoned her to work on the Ohio River. It was just Charlie and Sophia till Sophia married a man who made a mockery of their wedding by wearing yellow shoes. While Sophia's daughter Margaret was still young Sophia became a widow.

" This book is a kind and gentle read. There are no startling insights or life-altering observations but it is worth reading because it does speak of values and ethical behavior. The grandmother is a strong woman whose opinions are revered and who doesn't tolerate fools.

Her daughter is lonely and well-meaning and the granddaughter is growing into herself and her beliefs with help from her grandmother. This book has charm. ",3.0

" I was suprised at how gossipy William Bradford was. He told tales about his neighbors and friends and described how the pilgrims constantly bickered with traders and their benefactors over money. My whole fantasy about what I thought the Pilgrims were like has completely changed. Now I consider them petty self-righteous gossip mongers. The book was good for general information about preparation for their trip and what they actually did when they got here but as far as historical fact goes I was unimpressed. Bradford discusses people who stray from the flock 'outsiders' who get girls pregnant drunkards and preachers who were not to his liking. It was more like a 'dish' session n the Jenny Jones show than something I would be proud to uphold as historical fact to the rest of the nation. ",3.0

" I purchased one of these coffee makers because the Mr. Coffee brand has been around for quite some time and it didn't cost a fortune. While the Mr. Coffee coffee maker worked good and made coffee as it should it does have a few design quirks. First of all the carafe is designed horribly. You can't pour a cup of coffee without it leaking down the side. This made it a pain and a mess to pour any coffee. Another less serious issue with it is the fact that the window showing you how high the water level in the coffee maker is frosted and makes it kind of difficult to see what the water level is (being that the unit is white). While this coffee maker is OK and does what it is supposed to there are better ones on the market for your money. ",3.0
" This book was released in Australia last year. Unlike most Lessing books I found this 1 unremarkable. Overall it reminded me of an angst-free 'The Four Gated City' (my favourite Lessing read). Compared with the 'The Four Gated City' instead of an island off the west(?) coast of Britain we get impoverished AIDS-ravaged Africa. The African setting and characters are a stark contrast to the well-nourished middle class London characters - affecting. ",3.0
" Structured in two sections set in London and Africa The Sweetest Dream is an interesting chronicle of the turmoil of western ideology in the post-World War era. Lessing bitterly attacks the dogmatic views on communism and justice held by leaderships which were soon forgotten when they rose to power. Instead her heroines are women (Julia Frances Silvia) whose political positions are not so defined but who rise above their circumstances to provide care and support to those around them. The section set in Africa is particularly intense and vivid. On the other hand plotwise the story meanders too much and often loses focus specially in the 60's part. I got the feeling that the novel would have improved with better editing. ",3.0
" but I wanted to finish it- I liked the characters - the comings and goings that politicals tend to attract. I wanted more development of some of the characters- this book has a huge cast! I really liked the idea of these homeless wandering young people and the idea that there are people who would open their homes to them. good character studies here I think ",3.0
" The Sweetest Dream begins as the story of Francis Lennox and the group of disparate youths who come in and out of her life and her London home. The era is evoked by Lessing in her typically intelligent prose with characters who are well-defined and a plot that although very loose is always interesting. Halfway through the book however the young Sylvia leaves to become a doctor in ravaged Africa and when she arrives there the book loses all its focus. It's a steep decline from the book's enjoyable first part and is emblematic of Lessing's tendency to (in her later works) go off the deep end and never really find her way back. Lessing is interesting throughout the book for her powers of observation as well as how she defines the character's desires and the way they intersect but the book nevertheless quickly becomes a tedious chore to finish as the plot offers a dwindling amount of storytelling for the reader to hold onto (or even be interested in). The end result is a mess a beautiful one that is written in earnest with genuine compassion at its center but a mess nonetheless. Tepidly recommended for Lessing completists only. ",3.0
" A good plot diluted with far too many sub-plots some of which were rather contorted.With remarkably few words this author can conjure up a vivid scene e.g.(pg.14)'she would go slowly upstairs leaving behind her on the stale air the odours of flowers and expensive face powder.' However at other times the story is bogged down with far too much detail.I liked some of the social and half-humorous statements that popped up from time to time. e.g the author's take on international conferences where 'they get paid to travel to some beauty spot and talk nonsence....they take off every day to see the lions and the giraffes and the dear little monkeys and I don't think they notice the land is perishing from the drought.' (437).There were a vast number of characters in this book making it difficult to keep track of everyone. What became of Clever and Zeberdee? We don't know. What became of Rose the journalistwho came to Zimlia and tried to undermine and wreek havoc for Sylvia? That thread was dropped unceremoniously. Why so much attention to Colin's daughter Celia at the very end? Above all how does the name of the book fit this story? ",3.0

" Thomas Hardy while certainly an extremely talented author seemingly had the knack of producing Victorian-era soap operas which never fails to depress even the most cheerful soul. Sometimes his depressing stories has a message that produces a somewhat cathartic reading experience (as with Tess of the D'Urbervilles) but with The Mayor of Casterbridge all we get is utter negativity. This mayor is one twisted selfish and self-loathing individual. He seems to live with a rain cloud over his head and doesn't quite understand how it is to be loved. Fun guy? Nope. And there isn't even a happy ending.Bottom line",3.0

" My giving this less than five stars has more to do with my reader experience than the novel itself. I'm just tired of neurotic English characters who are obsessed with class (are they ALL obsessed with class?) and destroy themselves due to inherent character flaws. Henchard is hot headed and makes bad decisions. He drinks repents drinks spirals out of control. This is almost a cliche in novels now. I suspect Hardy might be lost or relegated to Freshman English classes as the canon grows and embraces more 'diversity.' In short Dickens' characters are more interesting. Forster's visuals transfer better to the screen thanks thanks to the Merchant Ivory team. I hope Hardy does not get lost in the shuffle because I actually enjoyed the prose quite a bit although I probably liked his descriptions of the town and countryside and even some of the minor characters (that old 'seer' guy who predicted the weather) who were more representative on a mythic level more than Henchard.

" Though I expected sadness and misery I was hoping for something more profound at the ending than 'Happiness was but the occasional episode in a general drama of pain.'This is a many chaptered narrative that shows how the results of good intentioned-or-not mistakes can lead to personal ruin. The reader also will lose all respect for the main character.A problem with Victorian Period literary giants I have is their long sentences. I counted one at 82 words.Would only recommend this to someone who likes a challenging read (big words and colloquial language) and who doesn't mind a depressing predictable story.'The sun was resting on the hill like a drop of blood on an eyelid.' Best line. ",3.0
" I had never been so against reading a book in my life. Everything about it seemed boring; the cover the title and even the way the pages smelled. It was only the fact that Henchard sells his wife and baby in an auction; that kept my interest alive.Even with a premise as weird as this one the book's beginning was painful. It wasn't until later on that I discovered the book wouldn't be as painful as I feared. The Mayor of Casterbridge is based entirely on irony and coincidences. Never have I rolled my eyes so many times in disbelief.Hardy created a soap opera-like world in the town of Casterbridge. This actually gave a humorous appeal to the book. After every major section of the book you can't help but mumble 'Sure...'Some people deem this book 'Depressing' however The Mayor of Casterbridge didn't once give me a similar feeling. This book is presented in such a way that it helps you laugh at other people's misfortune.I wouldn't recommend this book as a 'free-read;' But if you must choose between a bunch of boring books and this one happens to be on the list then I highly recommend you choose it. It may seem boring at first but give it a chance; Hardy's humorous look at tragedy will give you a good laugh. I mean how bad can a book be that starts out with its central character actually selling his wife and baby girl at a fair? ",3.0
" R kelly shows a different side of him on this album with tracks showing more of his pain and suffering and not just focusing on booty calls. While listening to this album I hear traces of his old hits and formats and they are not new hits just carbon copies which for me take away from the album. R kelly has some winners on this album like 'I don't mean it' and 'A Woman's Threat' and the intro track 'TP-2' is off the hook. I wish that was longer I replay that one over and over. The 'I wish' remix brings tears to my eyes remembering my falling peoples.

" I wish to give R.Kelly his props. Vocally he's been compared to Charlie Wilson of the Gap Band and Aaron Hall of Guy but he's truly grown into his own man. I'd even go as far as saying that R. Kelly is the reigning King of R&B. He's done a whole lot in his over 10 years in the business. Let me give you a brief summary of his achievements.On his first album with the Public Announcement he gave us 'She's Got That Vibe' the now classic 'Honey Love' and 'Slow Dance'. He produced tracks for Hi-Five on the side. Then in 1993 he dropped his real debut '12-Play' with 'Bump and Grind' 'Sex Me' and my personal R.Kelly favorite 'My Body's Callin'...that's just the first half of his illustrious career.He introduced us to the exquisitely sensuous Aaliyah (and I'll leave that at that). Then he did a killer remix of Janet's 'Anytime Anyplace' wrote Michael Jackson's 'You Are Not Alone' and released a third album with cuts like 'You Remind Me Of Something' and the unforgettable song and video 'Down Low'. Then he worked with the Isley brothers Mary J. Blige and Toni Braxton. In the fall of 1996 he released 'I Believe I Can Fly' from the Space Jam soundtrack which won 3 Grammys.Then he released the 'R' album in 1998 a double CD that used elements of the '12 Play' cover art. I'll say it here",3.0
" R.Kelly is still doing his thing on this album. There's few songs that is worth hearing. Track 2581015 are ok. The problem with this album is that there's no major change on his style of singing after a while you can't tell the differences.If you are a huge R. Kelly fan you should try this album. ",3.0
" As good as R's other albums have been in past this one left me a little confused. As good as the production value and arrangements were on the album the lyrics leave a little to be desired. Granted 'I wish' is definitely a keeper along with 'I Don't Mean It Part II' and 'Strip for U'. The confusion comes from R's insistence to lace the majority of these songs with sex. How can U have a song which pays homage to a passed away homie('I Wish') and another song which promises a lover true commitment and sacrifice('I Decided') and then come back with disappointments like 'Fiesta' 'Greatest Sex' 'Like a Freak'and the worst one of all 'Feelin' on 'yo Booty'. R really disapponited me with that one. If R could have taken 'I Decided' or 'I Wish' and used one or both of these songs as the theme for this album I think he would have had a real winner on his hands. As it turns out you'll just have to be satisfied with an album where the good tunes R very good and the bad ones are well very BAD. ",3.0
" R. Kelly's 2000 album was one of his most successful and widely influential albums opening the star to a whole new fanbase mostly thanks to the excellent hit singles and their following remixes. Following the epic double albumR.from 1998 he returned two years later with another very ambitious album. This album is musically as soulful as any R. Kelly project and the pervading theme through the whole album is sex. The majority of the songs are bedroom jams or vocal conversations with women his seductive style being the main vibe. But he's at his best when he lets his spiritual side show and the gospel-tinged tracks are the best on the album. There are five or six songs on here that are among the very best of R. Kelly's career. These songs are uplifting inspiring and motivational otherwise clever and the type of song that exhibits his immense talent. He really is one of the finest talents in R&B; and there are more than a few instances where he flashes his amazing potential. However between the best tracks there is a steady supply of definite filler. The album is a lengthy 19 tracks long and it would be a much superior album if it were trimmed to about 12 (like its predecessor12 Play). The first half of the album contains way too many forgettable and predictable tracks while the second half is stacked with great material. The production is the type of big-budget music you'd expect on an R. Kelly album. This album contains some of the very finest material of R. Kelly's great career but be ready to sit through some substantial filler to get to it.The introductory title track opens the album a short and upbeat opener. 'Strip For You' is a forgettable sex song some early skip material before the very good 'R&B; Thug.' This song is well produced and R. Kelly sings in a fast staccatoed style that works nicely. I don't like 'The Greatest Sex' a fairly redundant and unmemorable song. 'I Don't Mean It' and 'Just Like That' are much better; while they're not among the album's best songs they're solid and enjoyable cuts. 'Like a Real Freak' and 'Fiesta' are both Latin-influenced club songs both fall under skip material for me I wish the Jay-Z collaborated 'Fiesta (Remix)' were included on the tracklist instead. 'Don't You Say No' emits some nice musical vibes and 'One Me' is a pretty good song too. The album gets great at about this point. The beautiful 'I Wish' arguably the finest song of his storied career is a sad yet uplifting song to a lost friend speaking of life since their passing. 'A Woman's Threat' however is among the worst songs on this album six banal and repetitive minutes and his verses sound like a shopping list. 'I Decided' is among my favorites with a great hook and good performance 'I Mean (I Don't Mean It)' is a little upbeat and funky. I think my favorite song here might be the touching remix to 'I Wish' titled 'I Wish (To the Homies That We Lost).' R. Kelly does not make remixes like most artists and his remixes are entirely new compositions of songs with the only similarities being the similar subject matter. 'To the Homies That We Lost' is equally as effective as the original 'I Wish' a more personal narrative to his lost friend. The production is beautiful and this song is excellent. The pretty good 'All I Want' comes next followed by the wonderful 'Feelin' on Yo Booty.' This infamous song showcases R. Kelly at his seductive best being humorous and clever despite maybe crossing the line a little here and there. The album closes with another of the finest songs in his discography the motivational 'The Storm Is Over' a well-written gospel-tinged track complete with a dramatic key change at the end.When this album is good it's great but at its worst it's redundant and forgettable. One can't deny that this contains some of the very best songs R. Kelly has to offer and for that fact alone this is an album I recommend. R. Kelly is one of the finest talents in R&B; and much of this album is a great example of this. More economical buyers might just want to buy the half-dozen or so best songs but overall this is a worthy purchase to make. ",3.0
" I have mostly all the R. Kelly albums and if I say so myself this is not his best of work. When I listen to this album I don't hear the soulful artist like before. I hear rap and that's the way he has changed. Don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with rap. I just didn't want to see him go this way.

" There is no denying the fact R Kelly has got a great voice and is very talented that is why he can turn some mediocre songs into hits.

Songs such as 'Just Like That'  'Fiesta' 'I Wish' 'A Woman's Threat' 'I Mean(I Don't Mean It)' and the inspirational 'The Storm is Over Now' are the ones that really stands out and the more you listen to it the more it grows on you. But compared to '12 Play' this album is a three star. ",3.0
" I have all of R Kelly's albums. The man has a great voice. In this album it seems that the executives may have had too much influence in his music. What happened to the R&B? I know Hip-Hop is happen'n but it's not really fitting R Kelly.This album does have it's highs. One is R Kelly's voice and his mix of Hip Hop and his R&B style. It make a sweet CD to play. The lyrics are truely R Kelly though the record label's influence does have him getting 'To The Homies'.If R Kelly really got intouch with himself he could be the 'King of Soul'. This point really seems to hold him back and this album is a good reflection of this. As the self proclaimed 'King of Soul' he does excellent but can do better. ",3.0
" When R. Kelly is at the top of his game he is one of the greatest R & B singers in the biz. Like pretty much every other Kelly album there are the standout songs but the rest are just fill-ins. Standouts on this album are the upbeat 'fiesta' the emotional 'I Wish' (both versions) the eerily bumpy 'A Woman's Threat' the uplifting ' The Storm is Over' and the slow emotional 'the Greatest Sex'. The rest of the album is mediocre. Had Kelly cut the number of songs on this album he could have made an album you could listen all the way through and love the whole thing......unfortunately for us he didnt. ",3.0

" Boot Hill is a Guiseppe Colizzi film and Colizzi also directed 'Ace High'. Spaghetti western fans will appreciate Boot Hill as an essential addition to their collections and Colizzi maintains the gritty realism throughout. Colizzi began experimenting with rapid action close-ups and handheld camera work in this film -- sometimes it works and sometimes doesn't. In the opening scene Colizzi manages to capture an 'art house' film effect which spaghetti western fans will love but traditional western movie fans will probably deplore. Colizzi also introduces the idea of an Italian-style circus to a western town which is truly bizarre yet creative throughout. But the biggest problem with this movie - besides the technically poor rendering from film - is the lack of a cohesive plot structure. The story gets far ahead of itself early on and the viewer will wonder if 'Boot Hill' is really three separate films rolled into one. There is a midway point where a third character is introduced to effect a situation where the protagonist can explain things and even tell us what will happen next! To complicate matters further the roles of two characters are never made clear. Even after watching this movie several times it is not entirely understandable to most viewers that this movie is about a large mining company trying to defraud small prospectors from their claims with a circus thrown in to create interest. Diehard spaghetti western fans love Colizzi's juxtaposed plot style and many of us watch these films over and over picking out new details every time.

" Originally published in 1922 and out of print for years *Lady into Fox* by David Garnett has recently been republished by McSweeneys in a beautiful jacket-less hardcover. It is illustrated with wonderful woodcuts by R.A. Garnett. It is a well written novella with a fanciful tone.This is the story of Mr. Tebrick and his wife who in the first few pages turns into a fox. Mr. Tebrick though taken aback by his wife's new condition still loves his wife even through her adulterous affair with another fox and her [...] kits from this affair. Even more complicating the story is that they live an area of England where fox hunting is a daily pastime - one that Mr. Tebrick has enjoyed on many an occasion in the past.So why you ask did I only give this book 3 stars? Unfortunately I knew exactly where the book was going and exactly how it was going to end within a few pages of Mrs. Tebrick's transformation into a fox; and the story played out as I expected leaving me no joy in the discovery no surprises no pleasure in the reading.This doesn't mean that others won't enjoy *Lady into Fox* only that I didn't even though this a nicely packaged and well written book.>>>>>>><<<<<<<A Guide to my Book Rating System",3.0

" I am a teacher of Egyptian Belly Dance primarily but also teach Turkish style belly dance steps in my classes. Several of my students have been asking me about this new DVD.First let me say that the DVD has many charms and is best suited to beginner/advanced beginner students but that for the serious intermediate/advanced and professional teacher or performer there are stronger academically attentive and more thorougly researched DVDs on the market. Miss Sarah Skinner cites Eva Cernik Dalia and Elizabeth Artemis Mourat as among her teachers. I have had the pleasure and honor of studying with these accomplished master teacher and performers as well and recommend their DVDs/VHS tapes for turkish (Eva and Elizabeth Artemis Mourat) and dynamic skirt dance/fusion styles (Dalia's video media and a superb music CD).For the Beginner and Advanced Beginner student this DVD includes at least one turkish traveling step I have seen taught by Eva and Artemis- and is a good start for a student with no previous knowledge base. American fusion type skirt dancing steps are also included also helpful for the beginner. There are simple choregraphies throughout the DVD well executed that will be helpful to beginner students but frankly lack the fire passion and wild playful abandon that for me is so quintissentialy turkish.The costuming section is an excellent rundown for students teachers and performers and the strongest section of the DVD. In fact Ms. Skinner has a great eye for costumes and color combinations and I would love to see a DVD from her in the future focusing solely on this topic. I am not sure if there are any up to date DVDs in recent years on this topic currently on the market at the moment.The veil number was very beautiful and again a great study for beginners and others who may not be ready to or want to do complex turns and intricate veil combinations. This number gives great ideas for 'still' shots and dramatic poses that are audience eye catching. The costume here was elegant and Sarah is a very pretty dancer with flowing dark hair who carries off the mood of this piece spledindly. I did find it odd though that the music was a classic Andalusian piece sung in spanish- on a DVD touting 'Turkish' dance.Overall a useful DVD for beginners with lots of great costume and still shot pose ideas...However perhaps a different choice in title touting the many rich and various threads of the fusion style belly dance taught and perforemd in this DVD would have more aptly described the total DVD.

" I bought this DVD just to look at and get ideas for costume making - and this DVD is a great inspiration for that as it has a section set aside for costume making. Sarah's costumes are gorgeous - aaah those skirts - I want them! As I am sure you will too.The choreographies are ok but I will change them a little to suit my own style I like the music Sarah used. And as a drummer (Drummer/Dancer) I found myself watching and listening to the drummers instead of watching Sarah dance. I may have to go back later and watch Sarah (sorry Sarah) ha ha. But I found it useful as i was able to play along with the drummers.But all in all - I would recommend this DVD for those of you who are as mad on dancing and drumming as I am. And it is reasonably priced. ",3.0

I would presume the future books will continue at the pacing set in the last 100 pages of this one or at least I hope they do.The zombies a.k.a.",3.0
" The whole autumn series.. If your not used to actual english style writing you will possibly find it slow boring or annoying in some way. This series isn't too bad with it but its there. The story is really good but for long expanses it seems the characters just sit around and whine for chapters at a time. The action parts of the book are really good but these long expanses of supposed hopeless despair suffered by the characters also truely gets felt by the reader due to how boring it gets to hear some brits whine and cry about losing their families. I guess it's pretty realistic on that part because the end of the world would be pretty horrible. But it also made it pretty hard to force myself to keep reading each of the books from this series. I think the only reason I continued to read them was because I already bought the whole set and so I can count them in my collection of zombie books I've read. ",3.0
" I have to admit that I tried hard to love this book. However I could only find myself liking it. It just seems to move far too slowly. It is well written and there are even some moments that will have you at least inching forward in your seat but it just did not grab me. I will continue on with the series and see if perhaps it picks up. The story IS good enough to make me want to continue. ",3.0
" This is by no means the worst book I have read but I could never shake the dark feeling that I was being cheated somehow. I wanted to root for the characters but I found myself caring less over the course of the read instead of more. While I wanted depth and complexity to the characters they were shallow and contradictory. Ultimately I could not connect with them and wished they would just die already.The storyline was only marginally better and too many twists just felt.contrived. ",3.0
" I have to agree with much of Mr Goddard's review. The story is like walking in dense woods - you wonder how long before you get to the other side. Since this is a the first of a few books and it was a FREE download I'm going to give the series a fair shot with the next book. If the progress stays this slow I am out.Detail is good and character development as well but for so much time spent with the characters you'd think you'd know their backgrounds better. Zombie encounters had a unique take with their own development but they were limited. Honestly this feels more like half a book and perhaps it was the author's intention.So overall it's not a bad book but it is incomplete. The next volume may flesh it out.Look up Moody and Autumn on Google and you'll find the author's website with the download. I read it in about 3 hours. ",3.0
" David Moody Autumn (Infected Books 2002)To take an old publishing saw and turn it on its head for every million self-published disasters where cartons of bloody horrible novels sit in an author's basement waiting for a single sale there's one monstrous awe-inspiring success story where a self-published author becomes richer than Croesus based on word of mouth alone.But I'm not here to talk about Christopher Paolini I'm here to talk about David Moody. Who is not yet Croesus but probably will be given a few more years.Autumn is like nothing you're ever read. It is often referred to in word-of-mouth gatherings as a zombie novel (and in some cases the zombie novel) and it's blurbed as a zombie novel on its cover. But here's the thing",3.0
" If you're into zombie books you'll know this story well. It's very predictable.

" ...I'll just talk about the book as a physical object.The print is large and glossy. Not grade school primer large but still larger than normal novel type. But it's the glossy that gets me made it hard to read in bed with the light right behind me. The reflecting words disappear into the page. Rather aggravating.The cover has a rather gruesome illustration on the front. No problem I see gruesome pictures all the time. The back of the book though has a TERRIFYING picture. It scared me this tiny zombie face in a sea of blackness. When I read the book I had to be careful to keep it angled so that my wife couldn't see the front or especially the back cover. She would've been left climbing the walls all night.Unfortunately the cover design is slightly amatuerish and the defining line is visible between the black edge of the graphic and the black of the book cover. Eh who cares? I don't not really but it bothered me when I noticed it.My reaction to the story in brief was boredom shooting to tangible fear half way through. The writing isn't the best at points and an awful lot of time is spent on the feelings of the characters but when the horror kicks in it was upsetting.I will be buying the next book. ",3.0

" First let me applaud the author on creating a compelling Zombie world in which to take his readers through. With some nice twists (Zombies which do not immediately rise and when they do...don't immediately notice the Living..brilliant!)...this book is written with a more serious tone than some other books in the genera might be. This is a book for the person looking for a Zombie drama not a Zombie Die-Hard experience. Also because the situation takes place in England its a refreshing change of location.Unfortunately at least for me this book takes a very very very long time to get rolling. The very cool twist with the zombies I mention above is not used as well as it could have been in fact its somewhat tragic that the book didn't explore this situation further. Soon the situation changes and the standard human-attacking zombie is back in the fold. This is a cool idea that I hadn't encountered before and frankly I wished the author had spent more time here....it could have *really* made the pacing of this book unique (rather than the standard Humans-Run-From-Attacking-Zombies).Also endless reminders of the shattered psyche of the characters really starts to get in the way after a certain point particularly when nothing much is happening. When things do get rolling the story immediately begins to mirror...well.....isolated Farmhouse? 'nuff said. So we are treading on a bit of conquered ground to a certain extent. This by itself isn't an issue...but because the book takes quite a bit of time to get our characters to said farmhouse it seems to all wrap up fairly quickly...as though the Author only wanted to include enough 'meat' in this book to sell the sequel.One last thing because we are always reminded of the horror the characters are experiencing the author seems that gives them carte blanche to behave like jerks all the time. This gets old since halfway through the book I was hoping they'd all get wiped out and a new more 'deserving' bunch of humanity would appear ",3.0

" Well I got as far as page 150 and was ready to toss this book. I couldn't let it beat me w/ 130 pages left so I read on. What happened is that the book actually started to pick up and became readable.If you can handle an overly long setup and zombies that do nothing for over 1/2 of the story then you may like this little tale.There are better zombie books out there (and lord knows there are worse ones) so if you just saw the dawn of the dead movie and want to try some zombie horror I would begin w/ The Rising or The Walking Dead (TPB but the best zombie fiction out there). I also hear Twilight of the Dead is good.For me I have read most of the stuff out there and find this book falls somewhere in the middle. I will probably pick up the next book but don't feel compelled to do so.If You are in the middle of the book and are wondering if the zombies will actually do something well just keep reading and around page 160 the story will begin to pick up and ends well.

" Here's a great way to make a buck. Take some classic old 78 rpm church hollers and barrel-house rockers and sync in some beats per minute and have people call you a break-thru musical genius. I have to give Moby credit though. At least he's introducing compu-teens and upwardly-mobile handshakers to the shakes and quakes of the old school yard groove. When he keeps the field out of the studio he creates some thoughtful moments such as 'Porcelain'. And original collaborations like 'Why does my heart feel so bad' shine as well. Overall the album flows nicely and makes a satisfying salute to the joy of music. But has Moby changed the face of music? At the very least he's learned how to program its soul. My recommendation",3.0
" Play is a good album for the people who are new to electronica. I have to admit though Moby could have been more creative. He often uses a voice sample excessively. THat can be a little annoying. I hope Moby challenges himself further in later albums. I guess Play is Moby way to further finance himself. It's to commercial and plus he isn't the first to use gospel and blues singers is electronica. Moby is good but Recoil is better. ",3.0
" Hey overall this is a good album. HOWEVER... because it was such a big pop hit everyone thinks that they are really hip and into the electronica scene. THIS ALBUM IS NOT ELECTRONICA it's blues rock etc. with a beat and a synthasizer. In fact I find it rediculiously cheasy at certain parts (beginning of track 3). 'Body Rock' is kind of annoying. Despite all my criticisms Play is still really fun to listen to when you're high. ",3.0
" I bought this CD when it was released in 1999. Back then it seemed very avante garde. I thought I'd revisit it more than ten years on.The fact is it hasn't worn very well. What seemed new and innovative then seems rather old fashioned now. The sounds have been overtaken by better produced more technologically interesting creations and the revival of melody has left these non-melodic pieces behind. It's not unpleasant just repetitious and soporific.Moby like so many others was a fad. Briefly popular as the latest thing ultimately the material didn't have the staying power to be more than a passing success. Buy it for nostalgic purposes if that's a time you look back on fondly.

" This Moby CD is pretty good. I bought the CD and thoroughly enjoyed the first couple of spins. Over time I realized that the CD is just good (versus pretty good).

" When listening to Moby's magnum opus I couldn't help but notice the similarity to benign pop sclock like Will Smiths 'Get Jiggy With It' as opposed to brilliant electronica like Fat Boy Slims 'Praise You'.

" Well you know Moby is doing something right since this CD from 1999 is on all kinds of best-of lists even making #20 of Rolling Stones's best albums of the 90's (not that the mag has any musical relevance anymore). Maybe it's because Moby puts a face to the often anonymous genre of electronica. Maybe it's because he's American and his music is more easily understood by mainstream critics than say trance or techno.Or perhaps it's because he took a simple concept- melding old blues samples with a fresh paint of electronic music and made a series of inspiring sometimes beautiful songs. 'Honey' 'Find my baby' 'Why does my heart feel so bad' 'Run on' and especially 'Natural Blues' are proof of that.But that's only about a third of the 18 tracks on this album and they all must stand judgement. And this is where the CD falls flat. You get a selection of tracks where Moby does the singing or speaking 'South side' 'If things were perfect' 'The sky is broken' and 'Porcelain' and with the exception of the latter none have music good enough to carry his thin high-pitched voice.Filling out the disc (besides 'Bodyrock' the catchiest piece with guitar and a sample of Love Rap) are a series of short instrumental fillers '7' and 'Down Slow' and simple acoustic/ambient pieces (the last three tracks). These won't be the tracks you remember.There are some excellent discs here but they're within the first 11 of 18 songs. If you don't mind skipping around you'll enjoy this but it doesn't reward a complete listen. ",3.0
" I know the personality of the performer should be irrelevant when judging the quality of the music BUT 1] Moby allowing his music to be used for car ads strikes me as immensely hypocritical considering his so-called 'green' credentials and 2] the sheer EGO of the man that came across during his recent Glastonbury performance really stuck in the craw bigtime. A shame - as I would have given the album an unconditional ***** only six months ago... ",3.0
" Moby's 'Play' CD is a real treat - loads of great tracks. However the quality of the recording is among the worst I've ever heard. The recording quality is so bad that I can only listen to the CD in my car - it's off limits to my high-end stereo set-up. 'Porcelain' one of the best tracks on the CD is a case in point - great music but the background noise/hiss is so prevelant that I wonder whether it was introduced onto the track on purpose for some warped reason. Music rating - 5stars but the quality is the worst of all my 200 CDs and so I must call attention to this dramatic flaw - overall rating 3stars (Moby do yourself and everyone else a favor and get another recording company!!)

It doesn't make you better to call what other like crap.In short don't write the 5 star 'it changed my life' review because it doesn't do anybody any good and you probably aren't exactly a musical expert either.

" In the 90's I was all about Moby. His music was in major films people on MTV were talking to him all the time and the era was just right for popularizing electronic music at the time. I've seen him live 3 times and he doesn't exactly disappoint but his music does start to wear down on me. This album was the first I ever picked up by him and I needed to review it.Off the bat most of the album is an exploration into the fascination of sampling old works into new ideas. You get at least six songs on this album devoted to nothing more than exhuming old tracks and layering them over filtered mid-tempo drums. To me it's not that exciting anymore and it feels dated. There's moments where Moby goes back to his previous albums and starts singing...that's a bad thing to me too since he doesn't have a great voice in my opinion and one track (The Sky Is Broken) is just flat-out creepy requests for communication from someone. Moby is the master of moody inspirational instrumentals and 'Porcelain' became a hit after being featured in the movie 'The Beach' because of his interesting piano-meets-breaks-meets-synthpads approach. And he repeats this formula four other times on the album making the single 'Bodyrock' a little confusing to those expecting a new Fatboy Slim-inspired album.My favorites on this album are 'Machete' and 'Inside.' They're two opposite sounds that sum up what Moby is all about. It's important to note the instrumentation on the album as well especially since now in 2011 everything has become more digitally-created and 'messed with' so I can respect some of the guitar and piano in songs on this album. However songs like '7' need to go (just horrible guitar noodling over a cheap drum beat). Overall I might buy this if you're into DJ Shadow or more generic electronic music that is used for filler but it's gotten a little bland for my taste nowadays. ",3.0
" ...spoil an album that was teetering on the brink anyway. I am not familiar with Moby's music before this album and have heard the spiel about how he changes style and direction with every album and is a musical genius who calls himself the 'little idiot' blah blah blah wurble wurble. However after hearing 'Why does my heart feel so bad?' I was prepared to give him a go. Well I can tell you none of the music press rhapsodising rang true to me. When first I listened to this album I thought all the songs sounded very alike but decided that each would become more distinct the more I heard it. I was wrong. I know all music is formulaic but this is ridiculous. As singles all these songs would be good but as an album they fail to really make an impression. An album to me is a whole piece constructed of different yet interlocking pieces. This however was rather 'variations on a popular theme' and as we know what is once popular very soon becomes old and boring. Yes these bright brittle and sometimes sad songs are individually well worth the listen",3.0
" It would be hard to imagine using words like 'sweet' 'touching' or 'moving' to characterize most standard-issue techno but they're surprisingly appropriate for the best moments of the latest effort from this enigmatic and frustrating but ultimately winsome artist.To judge from the two hundred-plus remarks already posted Moby's samplings of country gospel and blues have left the largest impression on audiences. Such deployments of field recordings in club music usually run from clever to offensive raising the same spectors of cultural piracy that haunted the white blues bands of the British Invasion but here the device is one poetic license that Moby's heartfelt sincerity elevates and redeems. His guileless expressiveness often catches you unexpectedly-- listen closely for example to 'Natural Blues' for the sudden stab of grief in its starkly understated instrumental break.Most of the eighteen tracks fall into one of three categories; African-American samplings ('Honey' 'Natural Blues' 'Run On') Caucasian raps ('South Side' 'Bodyrock' most of them not so much offensive as painfully embarrassing) and ambient compositions.This last group is in some ways the most rewarding. 'Porcelain' on the strength of its eloquence survives being conscripted into the soundtrack for Leonardo DiCaprio's latest potboiler while 'Inside' manages to break the limits of lyricism by transforming distantly spaced notes like constellations emerging from the dusk into beautifully sustained melody. It's Gorecki not Glass who's the fitting peer for work as resonant as this.Moby's six years of diffuse releases may have stretched the patience of his core constituency but a larger audience awaits if he can lose the blue-eyed hip-hop and open up further to his inner depth.

" Moby's newest cd Play is hyped by many magizines (Spin Q Entertainment Weekly ext) all giving Play great reviews. Play is a great cd. I do recommend that you don't go out and blindly buy this not knowing the kind of music it is. Play is a mix of techno rock and blues. If you are a lyrics person there is not much to these songs. If you are looking for meaningful lyrics check out some bob dylan material. But there are some great songs on this cd.Like alot of people i only listen to around the first side of Play. Play is actually worth buying for the first side. Alot of quality songs (bodyrock south side ext). The South Side song on this album is not the remix with Gwen Stefani. For that you have to buy the single. South Side much more rock than most of the songs. Play has a great upbeat sound to them but have the depressing sound added also for a great sounding cd.I was really in a bind on whether or not I should give Play 3 or 4 stars. I sided with 3 because like I said earlier in this review I usually only listen to the first side or so. But this is a cd worthy of anyone's record collection. I do not regret buying it at all. ",3.0

" I can see how a CD like this could be a revelation to anyone who is not familiar with ambient music or electronica. Moby has put together a solid block of excellent pieces with 'Play'. Trouble is to a certain extent it's all been done before. Sure it's neat that Moby borrows vocal tracks from diverse sources and fuses them to awesome electronic treatments (not to mention exemplary keyboard and guitar work) but Eno and Byrne did the same thing back in 1982 with 'My Life in the Bush of Ghosts' (which is more interesting and challenging - with far more musical tension - than Moby's 'Play'). Moby's ambient pieces are also great (sometimes sounding like a sort of Eno/Yanni hybrid) but I prefer a tad more 'bas relief' in my musical wallpaper (such as for example the 'Passengers' soundtracks CD featuring Bono & the Edge and - for truly great ambience - Eno's 'Music for Films'). Finally Moby's 'quasi-underground rave rap' numbers are sort of cool but once again you'll find far more interesting hunting for such beasties on Eno's 1992 effort 'Nerve Net' and others like it. In short I was somewhat disappointed that I immediately liked this CD. I prefer to be challenged initially and then over time learn to love a new sounding approach to music. Don't get me wrong - there is some great stuff on this CD. I was just hoping for more. ",3.0
" The reason I bought this album like most people was the single 'South Side' a remix of which (featuring Gwen Stefani) plays on the radio. So listening to 'Play' was somewhat of a shock since South Side is the most rock-based song on the CD and it dosn't have Gwen's voice in it making it sound hollow. I was also taken aback by the lack of lyrical content (which is the main thing I look for in music) but the messages of the music are conveyed through the music -- all the electronic instruments loops and samples come together in an artful arrangement. I'm still not crazy about it but it is really a very good album. ",3.0
" ...I'm always looking for something different to track on my car stereo. My friendly neighborhood record store clerk directed me to this. It will according to he make me fall in love with whoever invented multitracking and DJ Teching...Yep I've heard of Moby but never had the opportunity to hear any of his sounds. Prior to this I've enjoyed Massive Attack Morcheeba Bjork Groove Armada.While Moby has some interesting pieces here I've found the other electronica and DJ type music mentioned above much more to my liking. Not to say Moby's stuff is bad. Let's just say it's cool... When I heard the first track it put to mind those early solo Paul McCartney tracks where he recorded tunes by playing all the instruments and he overdubbed he and Linda on the vocals. Some of Moby's instrumentals remind me of some of Badalamente's work with surrealist David Lynch but you know what? If I want Badalamente I'd buy Badalamente...speaking of another artist with the letters b a d in his name a few of the tracks reminded me also of jamacian multi-instrumentalist and one of my favorite keyboardist Wally Badarou but you know what? If I wanted Badarou I'd buy Badarou.This product of Moby is OK in my opinion. But it's no masterpiece. ",3.0

I personally do not give a scybalum about Moby's personal or political views. He's a gifted artist; so was Kurt Cobain so is Carlos Santana so was Richard Wagner. But I just want to warn you about the nonsense in his liner notes. Waawaawaa... poor moby. We mistreat our prisoners. Yeah if you get put into jail for a DUI or white collar crime and you are brutalized and sodomized that stinks.

" While it does cover a wide range of wildlife the drawings themselves are not very realistic - they represent the animal yes but not accurately enough to really be used as a teaching field guide even for non-magors. It'd probably be ok for younger kids though. There were some magor types of wildlife that I thought should be included that were not (red-tail hawk box turtle) as well as some that I don't know why they're in there (humpback whale viruses). The descriptions were short and included very little as to where the animals were actually found (no idea of range). The plants section was really tiny as well. Needless to say I'm still searching for a field guide to use in my class. ",3.0
" This compact book labeled and formatted as a field guide introduces young naturalists to city wildlife. It ranges widely among organisms in urban areas including many familiar mammals and birds as well as skimming a few bacterium viruses protoctists fungi and plants into the mix. Including these latter life forms reminds readers that there's a lot of life going unnoticed much of it too small to even see right around them. If however kids want to identify wildlife around them the usual reason to get a field guide including wildlife that literally cannot be seen is out of place. This latter issue rubs especially since so many more likely critters; ones that many kids will see around their neighborhoods were not included.Attractive illustrations are offered at one per entry and each entry is described in a few sentences. Don't expect the kinds of details in adult field guides. No information is offered on variations in size and appearance by sexes ages and seasons which can be essential for field identification. Nor are ranges presented. What this really offers is a general introduction to the neglected part of nature outside kids' front doors in an easy-to-browse format. For older independent readers. ",3.0
" I read Peterson First Guide to Urban Wildlife cover to cover since it's quite brief and succinct. It's oddly organized--despite claiming on the back cover that it focuses on the 'things you are most likely to see' it begins with a discussion of microscopic organisms including the common cold virus something everyone is familiar with through experience and yet not at all likely ever to see. The insect section covers many common household pests including 4 different kinds of cockroaches but only 4 butterfly species. The selection seems almost random at times; why include trees at all if there is room for only two and why those two? There are no maps and the information on ranges is often vague. However despite being very familiar with most of the animals and plants included I learned a few new things about some of them--for example that common barnacles are crustaceans not mollusks.Overall this is probably a handy little book for beginners or young people who don't have a lot of opportunity to get far from human habitations. It would make a fine addition to an elementary school library. The writing and illustrations are clear and easy to understand but anyone with much outdoor experience or a desire to learn more about individual species will quickly outgrow it. ",3.0

" Alice McDermott once again proves her best-selling author status in her novel THAT NIGHT. McDermott represents her original style of writing and her different point of view of important issues faced by the youth of today and yesterday. In this novel she expands on a subject that is sometimes overlooked or shoved under the proverbial rug. This subject can be summarized in two words teenage pregnancy. She uses her off-the-wall style of writing to enhance the importance of this subject and yet at the same time show the humorous side of it by portraying the story through the eyes of a child. Alice McDermott's purpose in writing the book That Night was to explore the other side of a teenage pregnancy the side that deals with the emotions and feelings of the teens. She foreshadows the pregnancy by portraying the boyfriend as a hoodlum to begin with so the pregnancy is believable and the relationship between the two teens is credible. Judging from the story McDermott's values are somewhat flexible. She shows the relationship between the two kids as young and immature yet she seems almost as if she condones the pregnancy. McDermott shows a moderately unbiased view towards the subject she writes about by continually shifting the focus to the young child through which the story is told. This act nonchalantly brings about the first person point of view from which she tells the story. McDermott's style is uniquely set apart from any other novel in its class. She jumps from present into past into present again but she doesn't lose the attention of the reader somehow. Her tone is very laid back and conversational yet she still shows her point of view in a very realistic manner. The story of two young teens in a passionate love affair really catches the attention of the reader. McDermott's use of symbolism in using two passionate teens to represent the hot summer nights is extraordinary. McDermott shows the irony of a little girl relating the story of a teen in the middle of a life decision that she although much later will have to face in her future. The diction used by McDermott proved also to be original. She depicts the little girl as being more mature than she really is by relating the deep and intelligent thoughts through the 8 year old. Her diction although original is somewhat unreal. McDermott fails to have the little child converse with anyone and also fails to give her a name. Granted this fact may have some valid reasoning that is hidden among the suspense of the fighting and mystery. McDermott has the plot unravel in an odd sequence which enhances the element of suspense in the novel. She uses intense imagery to display the raw emotion taking place in the novel. Descriptions of the fight are prevalent throughout the novel because the whole plot of the story is based around the one night when everyone's emotions went wild and the explanation of why this happened. I believe that Alice McDermott has her very own style of writing and she has a very effective style of writing. Although I may not always agree with the way she introduced an idea or event I highly regard her opinion and accept that she has reasoning for writing the way she does and introducing things the way she does. Her literary tactics are completely her own and they do an excellent job of making the reader think and contemplate on a new level. Her use of retelling the story through the eyes of an unbiased child is genius. By relating her novel in this means also heightens the innocence factor of the novel. That Night by Alice McDermott confirms this author's ability to bring forth a novel of such character and originality that it can become a best seller. Her other novels also attest to her brilliant writing style however odd it may seem. Making a best sellers list usually requires large amounts of experience but Alice McDermott accomplished this status twice within only a few years of a published career. ",3.0

" I was very looking forward to reading this book because it came highly recommended and because it seemed to be a guide for walking in the footsteps of many dedicated Christians. I am sorry to say that I was a little disappointed. Although many parts of the book are really excellent Ms. Norris spends too much time making commentary instead of just sharing the experience. I really enjoyed when she shared how she was moved by prayer to a point of conversion. And how the experience of the cloister strengthened her sense of self and her marriage. But the chapter on St. Maria Goretti while making a valid point was overkill. Still it is worth the effort through the tedious parts for the nuggets of wisdom which are also to be found there. My recommendation skip over the platitudes and embrace the jewels. ",3.0
" This is one woman's journey sketching her life her troubles and her spiritual salvation through a Benedictine Monastery. Quoting the Bible extensively Ms. Norris tells of her experiences with the Monks and Nuns. She is a writer a searcher and a poet. Words are her vehicle to explain life and God. She sees the poetic in the mundane and the special in the everyday. It is worth reading even for people who are 'non-biblical'. I found it interesting. The cover blurb reads '. . .Strange & Interesting . . .' which is apropo. ",3.0

And she has that great gift of seeming to write for all of us.My only objection to the book has nothing to do with style or her lyrical prose but with her use of obscenity-twice- about a third of the way through. It is just so unnecessary--even if you don't see it as wrong--for this to be found in a book on Christian Spirituality. To me it keeps me from recommending the book to some who might otherwise really benefit from seeing the world through Kathleen Norris' eyes. Which is a real shame. ",3.0
" Book ReviewThe Cloister WalkIn Kathleen Norris' book The Cloister Walk she invites the readers into her life as a Protestant poet feminist married woman who is drawn to the monistic life of the Benedictines. She details the struggles she has with reconciling what she knew as a child with what she is learning today. Kathleen also finds great joy in experiencing life as she does and seems to have no intentions of converting to the Catholic faith; she is happy being Protestant. While Kathleen takes the reader on her journey with her she takes time to fill the reader in on her past so that they can fully appreciate her present.This book was not what I expected when I first chose it specifically from its title. I was expecting a book about someone who is in a cloister and writing about that life but once I understood what the intent of the book was I enjoyed journeying with Kathleen. I also found myself wanting to know what happened in her life once the pages ended. One of the biggest strengths of the book was that it was engaging and kept me interested in Kathleen's life. The book also shed some light on the Benedictine life and left me wanting to know more. In my position at my parish I am often asked about good books. I can easily suggest this one as an option though not as a book to obtain knowledge about the Catholic faith but as a good summer read which I think can often times be very valuable. ",3.0
" THE CLOISTER WALK is a hodgepodge. In part it is a fragmented memoir of a fifty-year-old woman who was a poet and ten years previously after being at loose ends for much of her life had found sanctuary of sorts as an oblate with the Benedictines. In part it is a journal of nine months of experiences at a Benedictine monastery (St. Johns Abbey in Collegeville Minnesota). And in part it is a collection of religious writings some spiritual in nature and some historical. One of my problems with the book is that those different parts or aspects of the book are too jumbled. The book does not cohere; for me it scatters into its 75 or so entries (ranging from one to eighteen pages) like the seeds of a dandelion on a breezy day.If there is one thing that unites the book that is its author. THE CLOISTER WALK is not one of those books in which the author is unobtrusive. Kathleen Norris is on every page and the reader is presented in full measure with her apprehensions and insecurities her joys and epiphanies as well as her preachings. At one point in the book she writes 'I am observing my life more than living it' and that characteristic imparts an introspective intensity that leaves me notwithstanding my admiration for her somewhat uncomfortable. The author who takes the reader on this cloister walk is not a relaxed person and her existential intensity - existential tension even - ends up coloring many of the things she shows and describes.Nonetheless I found many parts of the book rewarding especially the descriptions of contemporary monastic life the discussions of the Psalms and the Book of Revelations and the accounts of assorted religious figures from history such as Mechtild of Magdeburg Mary of Egypt the Virgin Martyrs and Ephrem the Syrian. And while to my way of thinking there is more than a little gibberish - for example the passages on the difficult role of poets and artists in today's world - there also are nuggets worth salting away. Here's one",3.0
" As a woman who worships with both Protestants and Catholics on a regular basis I thought that I would enjoy the perspective of a born and raised Protestant living as an oblate in a Benedictine monastery.I consider myself to be a somewhat literary person although not poetic and found the poet Kathleen Norris to be rather obsessed with language. I also found her to be rather obsessed with some aspects of church history. I learned more than I needed to know about the Virgin Martyrs and St. Maria Goretti. Like some of the other reviewers on this site I was hoping to learn more about life in a monastery. Some of the human interest stories she tells towards the end of the book are moving and make me wish for more. The beautiful examples of holiness and long-suffering on the deathbeds of people she has known meant more to me than hearing about how many wounds Maria Goretti received when she was murdered.In fact I wouldn't suggest that this book be kept by the bedside for nighttime reading because some parts are quite disturbing for reading at anytime but particularly as bedtime spiritual reading.I feel as though Kathleen Norris wondered if she'd ever again write a book and thinking perhaps that this was her last chance--she filled it with all kinds of material from both the past and present. At least one reviewer commented that she wasn't focused--it did seem as though my mind was flying in every direction trying to keep up with her meanderings. Only occasionally did I feel inspired or uplifted. I honestly wonder how relevant some of this material is to the average Christian who just needs a spiritual pick-me-up and a peek inside the monastery walls. ",3.0

" While appreciating what Helen Hunt Jackson was trying to do with Ramona there are some aspects of the book which truly bother me. One can't help but wonder at her glossed over hisoricaly nostaligic view of the mission system in California. The Native Americans who were in this system were kept in virtual bondage and horribly abused both physicaly and sexualy and were forced to give up the lifestyles that they had known. I think Ramona has good intention but like Uncle Tom's Cabin the book it was modeled after suffers from a severe case of historical nostalgia. It is however interesting to read the book from a modern perspective in the sense that reform literature has certanly changeg over the years! A good read just beware of the hisorical inacuracies.

" I admit it...I never in a million years would have read Ramona if not forced to do so by my history professor for a class in race & ethnicity in American History. However having said that I found the book a thoroughly enjoyable read...overdramaticized yes but we can forgive it when we consider the original date of publication. However it is the story behind the story that is most interesting. What Ramona truly is....a middle class white woman's perception of what it might be like to be an Indian. Jackson was an abolitionist turned author in the 1830's. This is her most recognized and extensive work. So the next time you read it if you read between the lines you will see HER innate prejudices and assumptions. Butlike I said I enjoyed it immensely and reccomend it as a fun read...but don't take it too literally...it is after all fiction ",3.0
" I actually read a 1908 edition of this book but this was as close as I could find. I found Ramona to be a pretty good story but had trouble understanding why it was said to have been monumental in bringing changes to the government's treatments of Native Americans or why it apparently received such myth like status in certain parts of Southern California. I was raised in or had family in nearly all of the territory mentioned in Ramona (which ranges from San Fransisco all the way down to Mexico). I had never heard mention of the story until a local book dealer here in NC offered me a copy of it. It was only recently that I got around to reading it and I did like how well the book describes all the mountainous terrain I grew up in and miss so much particularly the mention of manzanita trees which are so beautiful but are only indigenous to that area. Also the mention of all the missions particularly the one in San Diego I visited so often was a nice mental vacation back home.Outside of the background I was excited to read this book that was suppose to have been so life changing for the Native American people as half my family falls in that category. Unfortunately I was not struck by anything earth shattering. Jackson does talk about the government's early allowances of whites basically claiming public domain over the natives' homes and lands which was definitely tragic but the true horror of what really happened at that time never really reaches the level it needs to to be moving. You would gain more from reading pure historical accounts or textbooks or visiting native area museums near the reservations. I found Ramona to be more of a love story than anything and even the love story was sweet but again just short of really moving. Ramona herself goes through mental and physical maturity and it was nice to see her grow with each experience throughout the story but her love Alessandro struck me as mostly annoying to be honest. It seemed he spent all of his time in constant outrage whining paranoia melodramatic smoochy love talk with Ramona or just bat crazy. Granted his people had been through some hell but even when things were good for him Alessandro just never struck me as a real man secure in himself and I wondered what Ramona was fawning all over. Even Ramona at one point makes a comment that she jumped to hear Alessandro laugh because it was so rare.I saw one reviewer on another of edition of this book mention that it seemed that Jackson was trying to write how she assumed the Native Americans spoke and acted. That is definitely the impression I got too. Particularly with Alessandro but with many of the Native characters they would either sound White-influenced or Mexican-influenced in their speech and behavior but never really Native American to me. Jackson's 'Indian' dialog reminded me of the way they would make Tonto speak in the old Lone Ranger movies. Not to mention that Natives (at least the men lol) are not so open with their emotions and feelings even with wives. There is a guardedness and stoicism that just wasn't well portrayed here.Like I said Ramona is pretty good to get an idea of the Southern California landscape and there are some great interesting characters - Ramona herself and especially the sassy Aunt Ri (though her deep Appalachian dialect makes for tough reading-at certain parts it goes on for pages!). The love story between Alessandro and Ramona is cute and bittersweet and you do feel for them through their joys and tribulations but overall it just wasn't QUITE as moving as I was hoping for. ",3.0

" Endless Love was an everyday love story about teenage love. Yet it was here that both lead actors got their big break. Well we all know what happened to Brooke Shields. She now stars in her own sitcom Suddenly Susan. As for David who went on to pursue smaller roles such as portraying a reverend-turned-werewolf in Steven King's Silver Bullet you could say that things did not turn out to be quite as well for him. Overall although both actors intended to shoot for the stars their performance can best be described as well...jaded. ",3.0
" Although much maligned this movie isn't that bad. At least I was able to sit all the way through it which I can't say for a lot of more heralded titles. Based on Scott Spencer's novel about teenage love as Pauline Kael has observed it's like the male version of Splendor in the Grass. In Splendor Natalie Wood was so nuts about Warren Beatty that she was packed off to a loony bin. Here Martin Hewett is just as obsessive about Brooke Shields and he's the one who ends up institutionalised. Director Franco Zeffirelli is more interested in presenting the teenagers as modern day Romeo and Juliet and he pulls back on the sex that was rampant in the book. Hewitt and Shields still have sex but it's staged so unerotically that the fact that Shields needs sleeping pills becomes a joke. It can't be that her recreation makes her too hyped to sleep and considering how often they are seen to engage in activity it's a wonder she can stay awake at all. Zefferilli probably equals Spencer's purple-ness in a climactic brawl and with the hysterical performances of Don Murray as Shield's father and Beatrice Straight at Hewitt's mother. As Hewitt's father Richard Kiley is quietly assuming and as Shield's mother Shirley Knight is warm and tender this being one of her last films before she began to gain weight. The 'liberal' household that Knight and Murray share which is meant to be a catalyst for the love that the teenagers are just 'too young to handle' also has odd indications of incest and this prepares us for a later scene where Knight makes a pass at Hewitt. That Hewitt is using Knight to get to her daughter still doesn't seem to shift the shame of an older woman/younger man seduction off Knight and the fact that he had been sleeping with her daughter makes things even more queazy. Thankfully Knight manages to retain her dignity but the point that she is still an attractive woman seems beside the point of Hewitt's rejection. When Hewitt is banned from visiting Shields at her home we wonder why that means he cannot speak to her at school. And when Shields' family have a party we also wonder why Hewitt is not invited. From the glimpses we get of Shields at the party she hardly seems pining for her 'endless love' partner so we are apt to believe the information Hewitt has overheard - that the couple have broken up and the implication being that Shields is again a free agent. These mixed messages culminate in Hewitt confronting Shields and nearly raping her to make her admit she still loves him. Hewitt is required to act more than Shields since his character has more at stake than hers in the narrative and though he falls back on boyish head-lowering and makeup provides him with a masculinising stubble he is convicing when he cries in the rain. Shields however is used like a model. Cinematographer David Watkin captures her at what may be the height of her beauty a standard Shields has been unable to rise above in her adult years. This film also features James Spader in one of his early snooty roles as Shields' brother and a beefy Tom Cruise in one scene. ",3.0

The entire film is amateurishly done though I would give it an A for effort if that really mattered. The filmmakers were trying to make a thriller about an extremely mysterious young woman and the movie accomplishes that. Also the energy almost makes up for the lack of talent and quality. However the subtext concerning 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' is an interesting idea better left on the drawing board and the script could have used some tightening. Fans of horror films have grown accustomed to low budgets because films in the genre are rarely taken seriously. After watching films such as this one can understand why. Nonetheless a low budget is not an excuse to produce a low quality film. Filmmakers must work within their budgets and not provide signs that indicate any limitations. Lack of a budget doesn't bother me but the filmmakers must have realized how ridiculous the effects at the end of the movie looked. To be taken more seriously they could have revised the ending to avoid these effects. The fact these effects were left in the movie indicate to me this movie is meant to be fun not earnest. Taken for what it is it really isn't awful. ",3.0
" This book is an attempt to create SPAC Soil Plant Atmosphere Continuum. But looks more like a series of lecture notes. Written in clear manner covering aspects of water in soil plant and atmosphere. Each chapter also has a brief biography of famous person responsible in the topic discusses from Richards to Nielsen Hertz Boltzmann etc. Also contained instruments and anecdote behind them such as how disc permeameter evolved and patented.In Chapter 2 the author stressed the importance of using SI units. But other chapters still use non SI units eg. dynes/cm3 bar.The author tries to incorporate many modern instruments but some classical methods and theories still used. such as using wheatstone bridge to measure conductivity and electrical analogue.

" I am German and this is the first German movie I have EVER seen in the theaters! It was also my last one because it didn't live up to my expectations - even though critics reported it was the best German movie ever... Anyway the best part of the moive are the first 2 minutes (the preface). The idea itself is quite exciting but strictly speaking the movie is just 30 minutes long and is repeated over and over again with vario9us scenarios... it get's very boring after a couple of minutes. Only the theme keeps you interested. It is not an action film it is no thriller no horror no satire I don't know what it is but I wouldn't go for this one. ",3.0

" With all the critics out there praising this movie from beginning to end I just couldn't help but be a little curious. So I purchased it hoping that it would at least live up to half the hype. Well for all it's worth Lola doesn't lack anything in the style department as promised. The critics weren't kidding when they said it had stunning visuals a pulse pounding soundtrack and a pace only a cheetah could catch up with. Unfortunately it just plays out like an extended MTV music video. The plot starts off interesting and easy enough but the twist and turns all end in such a predictable and almost rushed way. Almost like the director gave up on the last half of the movie. Sure I like the whole 'cause and effect' feel but it could've been polished more. To keep it simple Run Lola Run is a roller coaster ride of a movie with adrenaline pumping speed . Just be forwarned it's not for everybody. ",3.0
" I challenge anyone to fall asleep watching this movie! The combination of the techno-beat soundtrack and Lola running feels like it should be as bad for you as looking directly at strobe lighting. The main idea behind the movie has been done many times before - having the chance to re-live the same day again to reach a different conclusion. The director shows us how coincidence and chance affect outcomes. This isn't a film for realists fans of great dialogue or character development. But if you think you would enjoy watching a movie that grabs you by your senses and shakes you up you could do a lot worse. ",3.0
" Run Lola Run. The first time I watched this flick (which is a in my own personal DVD collection) I wasn't blown away. There's allot of hype about the flick how great the movie is how mind blowing the music is blah blah blah... and with the advice Flavor Flave gave us all about 'the hype' I didn't believe it. Instead I went out and bought it because I was curious. The plot? Girl runs to save boyfriend. That's it. It was like 'Groundhog Day' on ecstasy. I'll give it credit for being original. I'll give it credit for knotting up all the details. I'll give it credit for energy as it had a lot... but in the end I was rather bored with the ending. It kind of fell off. The music house music which you can find in most new age independent films. Watch it in German with the subtitles because the English dub is so over-acted it makes it look ridiculous. You'll enjoy it more in German as I did... the second time. ",3.0
" This movie is overrated by people who might have found the movie's concept really really cool. I think this movie doesn't provide much beside its original....(daring)screenplay.

" This movie explores the variations that affect our day. Most of the time small changes wouldn't mean much. But when life is on the line one small change can have a profound impact on the following decisions events and coincidents. This movie is brave enough to show them taking a page from Rashomon which shows the same events from 3 different perspectives.However where this movie lost me was caring for the characters. The boyfriend whose life is on the line is a gangster a drug dealer. Why would I care if he lives or dies? So he can poison the youth later on?Overall the DVD is average. There's not many extras but it is a 2-sided DVD that has both widescreen and full-screen versions (for those of you that like to miss 40% of the movie). This movie may worth a watch not much more.

" I read someone else's suggestion that this German film would inspire Hollywood to copy it. It would if it were that original. I have seen this idea done twice already in America. The first was a short film about a man who was unable to avoid repeating the same few moments in his life for an entire day. The documentary-like film had no stars. The next thing I knew Bill Murray was starring in Ground Hogs Day an almost complete replication of the short film I had seen earlier. The short film isn't particularly a comedy the Murray film is.Run Lola Run is not a comedy either. Its a film about a girl who has 20 minutes to save her boyfriend from robbing a store. Manni Lola's boyfriend needs 100000 in 20 minutes to pay his bosses back for money he has left on the subway train. His life will be forfeit if he is unable to pay this money to the men he works for as a courier. Three times Lola runs in order to help her boyfriend. Each time the scenes are largely replicated but there are minor differences in timing. These differences result in major differences in what happens. I'm not going to tell you why the sequence repeats three times or how it comes out.Suffice to say that the film technique here is extreme razzle- dazzle. I don't think there has ever been a German film with this much heavy production and effects. Mostly we see Lola traversing a German city going from one building to another across one scenic plaza after another running at full speed. In each rerunning of 3 very similar scenarios her encounters with people places and objects are just slightly off. The minor changes in time make for major differences in what happens.I have to tell you the film was an obvious formula with too few variations to excite me much. Some might like it. I didn't think it was as much a story as it was a production. I wouldn't recommend it. Its wonderful filmmaking but very poor story-telling. ",3.0
" I don't like to disagree with the friend who lent me the DVD of this movie. I always appreciate the foreign cinema. Since I was stationed in Germany for six years with the U.S. Army and had a few German friends who would occasionally visit me I was always looking for good German-language films. Belonging to a family of people who appreciate films I knew the major classics of the German Expressionist period and the Sternberg-Dietrich collaborations but I needed something newer to keep young German friends interested.Run Lola Run is very showy but it lacks depth. Now I don't disagree with other people who like this movie very much--the last thing I want is for people to think of me as hostile--but needs something to care about--a reason to exist--where the zippy photography and inter-cut animated segments would ultimately mean something. Run Lola Run seems to me to be a very shallow film. Except for this the film was very good. The film is successful at adapting a certain aura of contemporary German society the same side that like many of us Americans watch a lot of daytime television; I only intend a deduction.As always I recommend the following German films",3.0

" Run Lola Run has a very different style of directing - fast motion panning shots intersparsed with dark slow scenes intended to draw out the viewer's emotion. I have to give credit where credit is due and in that regard Run Lola Run is something completely different.In the same breath (and without giving any spoilers) the main premise of the movie is one you won't soon forget.But even with the unique directing style the definitive concept of the story and the good performances by the cast there's something lacking about this film. I couldn't feel the characters I couldn't put myself in their shoes. I couldn't find a reason to feel sad or happy even though there were several scenes where the director's intent was to do just that. The movie lacked depth and emotion.If you're a film student and you want to see a different style of directing see this movie. If you find enjoyment in watching something new plot twists rarely seen before see this movie. But if your enjoyment in movies comes from emotion and passion feeling the characters and experiencing the story with your mind AND your heart this movie isn't for you. ",3.0

" Tom Tykwer`s 'Run Lola Run' is a breath of fresh air. There is so much creativity and vision in this small film that it stands alone against the overblown star vehicles the major studios keep forcing upon us. It is a film brimming with energy and inspiration and a powerful salvo against Hollywood conventionalism.Lola (Franka Potente) is told by her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) that he has lost a bag with 100000 deutsche marks in it. She realizes that he will most likely be killed if the money is not delivered to the gangster Manni was supposed to meet. This realization starts Lola off on a quest to come up with the funds on her own. With time running out Lola bolts out of her apartment and runs . . . and runs . . . and runs . . .'Run Lola Run' is a treatise on the infinite possibilities a single situation can spawn. It is a metaphysical examination of how the choices we make will affect us forever and how the actions of others can profoundly influence the circumstances of our lives. Yet on a more simplistic level it is also an energetic display of filmmaking at its most creative. Its unique use of freeze frames novel camera angles instant replays and animation is proof that Tykwer is determined to give us a viewing experience unlike anything we've ever seen before. With a pulsating soundtrack and a bravura performance by Potente to complement his boundless creativity Tykwer succeeds in creating a truly original work. Here's hoping that his example will inspire the current generation of filmmakers to test their own creative limits in the hopes of surpassing the standard set by 'Run Lola Run.' ",3.0

" It would not be correct to say The Autumn series is a Romero-fan's ultimate zombie series but its not fair to say its 'the thinking man's' zombie series either.If you worked your way through Autumn and its sequel The City you pretty much know what you're getting. Some occassional grisle and gore but mostly a lot of complaining and 'didnt-we-already-go-over-this' dialogue. Still I know I was at least invested enough to see how things turn out. The sadist in me wanted more of the survivors to get mauled by the hordes but the Lost fan in me was interested to see how the ending would develop from here.Most of the most annoying characters have been weeded out by now so you know that you won't get too many 'what's the point' speakers from here on in but you still get your gaggle of quitters and whiners which would be fine if it weren't every other conversation.The scenes at the airport are certainly intense and make for the most thrilling in the series since the farmhouse stand-off on the first book.The Autumn series did just-enough blood/guts/gore to keep me invested the characters were interesting at time annoying at others and Moody's reliance on describing the state of decay on the zombies became less powerful the more and more he did it. By then he needed to raise the bar and emotional resonance by sacrificing a few more brave souls in a gruesome demise. ",3.0

" I have read and reviewed the first 2 'Autumn' books and I am probably sounding like a broken record. There is not enough of the over-the-top Zombie gore that I enjoy so much. There is however more action in this book than the first two in the series.The books are well written and interesting. The problem I have besides the absence of extreme Zombie gore is that the books focus mainly on the characters. The Zombies almost seem secondary to the story.I enjoyed all three books but this was my favorite so far. The suspense is tight throughout almost the entire book. You get a possible explanation of what may have caused most of the world's population to die. The Zombies are more violent than ever and the feeling of despair is at an all time high. Then the mood changes there may be hope!These books wouldn't be my first choice in the Zombie genre but they are entertaining. The story does lure you into wanting to know how it all ends. I have read the first three in the series and plan to read all five books. ",3.0

" This book will save your life? Were I a book club I'd say instead welcome this author when she cruises your way but don't necessarily trawl the Amazon to find her.Homes has ticked the right boxes on her resume. She attended Iowa Writers' Workshop belongs to Yaddo artists' community and teaches at Columbia University and the New School in New York. Her first novel Jack came at age 19. Her story collection The Safety of Objects inspired Rose Troche's film of 2001.Adopted at birth Homes recently documented the disappointing discovery of her biological parents. Maybe that resolved the personal trauma but what of the national trauma? Twin towers still loom as the pachyderm in the parlour of American fiction the gatecrasher that American writers struggle to overcome.The previous Homes novel dates from 1999. This one distances the setting to Los Angeles. It subverts the unspeakable via the menacing sinkholes wildcats wildfires and earthquakes known to monster that city. It introduces the rich but disconnected Richard Novak jolted by an 'incredible pain' he cannot identify.Show don't tell harp the sages of fiction. On the first two pages Homes tells us twice. 'Everything today is not the same and yet it is exactly the same and can never be the same again.' Followed hard by 'After years of making sure that he is left alone he is suddenly afraid to be alone afraid not to feel not to notice.'Surviving his opening bout of incredible pain Novak rapidly makes the acquaintance of an immigrant doughnut man a helpful quack doctor a 'crying woman in the produce section' a personable movie star who lives up the road and a famous author gone to ground. The 911-emergency operator recognises his voice after the reporting of his incidentally showy good deeds. During which time his semi-estranged New York son is driving closer and closer to Los Angeles.Such a concatenation of threats and disasters among the economically and racially diverse citizens of Los Angeles echoes the disguised feel-good of the Academy-awarded movie Crash. There is in Novak's accidental-tourist wanderings a refreshing undercurrent of making it right a healing serendipity. Once again things tend to be underlined. When our Good Samaritan shames the doctor's waiting room into helping an old lady Homes wills him to lecture the group 'That's the point isn't it?'The endpapers acknowledge another Amy H. long-time Homes supporter Amy Hempel. She is a mordant miniaturist whose seemingly innocuous stories sometimes conceal a black undertow. Meanwhile Homes makes benign observations like 'Driving a Bentley to Target-only in L.A. does this make perfect sense' and 'America has two kinds of politician-one has sex the other has war'.To make something great out of her good material Homes maybe needed to stretch out and suffer more. If not quite up for that level of literary sacrifice and rebirth she does offer something intriguing.(Canberra Times September 9 2006) ",3.0
" Here's the message of A. M. Homes' novel-get your head out of your woo woo and look around. Protagonist Richard Novak represents that unfortunate trend of people who are so impressed with their own self-importance that they have edited nearly everyone out of their lives. Richard has done just that so when he is overwhelmed by mysterious and extraordinary pain there is no one to pick him up from the hospital. Shaken by how he has cut himself off from everyone save those whose services he pays for he sees the importance of change. When he starts to pay attention to someone other than himself things begin to happen.Homes has set her novel in Los Angeles which is an easy shot. Bustling with immigrants from places ranging from Oman to Omaha and subject to a shifting landscape that seems mysterious to outsiders it's an easy place to pick for such crises of being. In fact 'This Book Will Save Your Life' should be made up of harder choices. It's charming it goes down yes easily and its message of open your eyes is a good one. But what of it were set in another city or even a town that doesn't have the built-in joke factor of LA? Richard is so rich and has filled his life with so much macrobiotic kitsch that it is hard to recognize him our regular lives-even in the guy whose cell call is so important that he can't be bothered to greet the barrista at Starbucks.And then once he does try to connect with other people they are an exceptionally colorful crew. No one is as dismissive of him as the old Richard would have been to them. Even the crankiest-the woman he meets sobbing in a supermarket-gives him a chink to get in.This is a warmhearted enjoyable novel but I want to see a darker deeper treatment of how we got to be in this fix.

The idea of a self-absorbed stock trader being shaken out of his rutted life and finding the joy and satisfaction in helping others is certainly promising.

As Richard (don't call me Dick) Novak goes through his life interacting with a movie star a crying woman a reclusive writer a kidnapped woman and various city functionaries concerning his sinkhole we never find out how he feels about any of the odd events happening to him!When Ben his son enters the story the emotions improve but not to a satisfactory level in my opinion.

" The audio book version of This Book Will Save Your Life (by A.M. Homes) benefits from the fine reading given it by Scott Brick. That Brick manages to give so many eccentric characters a distinctly recognizable tone of voice is in fact remarkable. And because these characters are the best thing the novel has going for it Brick's contribution is particularly important to one's overall perception of the novel.The book opens just as Richard Novak is suffering through a life-changing experience. He is on the phone with a rather blase 911 operator who insists on methodically interviewing him about the pain he his experiencing rather than taking his word that he needs immediate help. The pain so bad that Richard is even unsure precisely where he hurts does ultimately land him in a Los Angeles emergency room. The Richard Novak that emerges from that emergency room will not be the same man who entered it.Prior to his painful reawakening Richard was content with his life of relative ease and isolation. He lived alone working the stock market from his expensive home totally dependent upon the services of a daily housekeeper/cook and personal trainer to keep him going. The problem as he sees it now is that he is close to no one including the teenage son he barely knows.Richard's need to reconnect with humanity will lead him to a series of bizarre experiences involving those he encounters over the next few days.

" These grew fine in our basement. I was under the impression that we would have multiple harvests but the literature states two maybe three. That's a lot of cash for a few bowls of mushrooms. If you do have expendable income they are delicious. ",3.0
" I had a hard time growing these. Firstly you're suppose to keep it in the refrigerator to grow however the size of the block of soil they give you is SO BIG that there is no way it would ever fit in our 'frig (also because you need room on top for these to place the plastic hood and they sprout up rather high). It would be good if they sold them in smaller blocks like 1/2 or 1/3 the size so people could accommodate them in their refrigerators. They never really grew properly and always looked sparse and sickly. However to the company's credit they offered to replace it so that shows me they are honest. For that reason I give them 3 stars instead of 2. If they sold these in smaller packages for people with not much room in their fridge then I would give it 4 stars because I am SURE these probably grow much better in the fridge and I would've had better success had I been able to put them there. The smaller package would be easier to grow and a more affordable price (they'd probably even sell more too).

" The story starts out showing how children are left to fend for themselves and try to make adult decisions. A fire is started and kills one of the children showing how no matter what the circumstance a child is left to act like it only knows how to. The counch shell is also introduced and will be a 'telephone' for the children and also a sign of power later in the novel. I wasn't to impressed with the slow developments of the first 2 chapters there was alot of focus put on the children and not enough time spent describing the setting. The characters were highly detailed. Piggy is introduced almost as the adult figure while there is Ralph who is more the neutral party and Jack who is the complete opposite of Piggy. They introduce Simon to be like the conscience figure of the group stating how the only beast on the island was the boys themselves. It seems as though Golding attempts to show us almost a battle of good vs evil though out the book until the final chapter as we see the counch being destroyed and Piggy the only one with intelligence being killed. Ralph dodges numerous attacks through out the end chapters to be saved by a navy officer who comes to the island after seeing the smoke. I would have liked to see something happen at the end to the boys who were part of Jacks tribe or at least see something happen to Jack. The story ends with alot of answered questions in my mind on what happens to the boys having something to show us what later because of the boys would have been very nice. The story was fairly easy reading with some exception to the early chapters. There was a definate lack of interesting material. The later chapter from the point of the beating death of Simon to the last chapter was much more action packed and really does a good job of filling your imagination.

It is a book more for people that can read and understand old english. Other wise it is a pretty good book to read. ",3.0

" Lord of the Flies by Sir William Golding is about a group of boys trapped on an island in the middle of nowhere because their plane crashed. Lord of the Flies described how the kids dealt with life on the island with no adults and no sign of rescue in sight.Lord of the Flies is an interesting book. It has great interaction among the characters especially between Ralph and Jack. Ralph is an athletic kid. He believes in order and building a civilization on the island. That is why Jack and he fight. Jack is a strong-willed kid. He believes that the best way to run the island is just go hunt and turn in the rest of the castaways into savages. Ralph was the original leader of the tribe Jack however did not like how Ralph was leading and he started his own tribe. The two tribes did not get along and that made the story interesting.I enjoyed the way the boys learned to survive on the island by hunting and getting their own food. Jack's tribe hunting the boar down was quite exciting. However I did not enjoy the ending of the book. The story ended too abruptly and almost ruined the book for me. The book also would have been better if it had told more about the happenings. All in all Lord of the Flies was good book but because of the ending was disappointing. That is why I rate it 3 out of 5. ",3.0
" I thought that the book Lord of the Flies a an okay book I would not say that it was the best book that I ever read. The reason that I liked this book was that Golding did a good job of making the book and allegory and he used the characters to show human nature how it can be good but mostly savage. I would think that people that like this book are the people that like to read story for the deep meaning and not have everything told to them and use their imagination when they are reading a story. So overall I thought that Lord of the Flies was an okay book. ",3.0
" I think the book wasn't believable enough to relate it to anyones life. Yes it does have its points about life but all in all it isn't realistic. I think the author's(William Golding) purpose for writing this book was to state the theme that 'there is a need for civilization and rules.' I do agree with him. The book's high points are the events that happen when there is no civilization or rules. Murder theft and violence are all products of no civilization and that is shown in the book. The best literary element in this book is the characters. Golding described his characters to the max. You knew what a character was thinking when he said something or did something. The good characters were so innocent and pure. While on the hand the evil characters were some of the worst people I've ever read about. The reader also loved to hate the evil ones they do things that get on your last nerve. I don't think this book is believable. In the book the children have to deal with events and situations that a thirty year old man would have trouble trying to solve. Children of the age of twelve or younger break into groups because of who stole the toy or the video game not about how they should live or whether or not a childs schedule fits their lifestyle. Bottom line is that the book was good but has it's flaws. ",3.0
" [This is an old review lost in the amazonian jungle now reposted at the request of the Lord of the Gadflies.]The two boys we meet on the first page of 'Lord of the Flies' Ralph and Piggy are as freshly minted as Adam in the Garden or the earth/ice gods of Greek and Norse mythology. Born full-formed they are pre-modern utterly unsurprised by their own existence. They are no more plausible as 12-year-old boys than the usual totemic first humans of 'creation myths' from cultures around the world. Plausibility is not the objective of myth; moral instruction is and 'Lord of the Flies' is plainly intended as a morality tale illustrative of human nature which is depicted as innately savage held in check only by authoritarian social structures and above all by 'rules'.Reading 'Lord of the Flies' as a version of Genesis does make the story clearer though I make no claim that such clarity was William Golding's intention. But",3.0
" Maybe it's the fact that I am around 40 years old and I should have read it when I was 15 - but I couldn't really connect with the story. By the time it finished I did not really care too much about what happened to each of them - Piggy Ralph Jack or anyone else.I suspect it is the fact that I could not believe the story as a whole - lots of little kids living on a deserted island surviving on fruit.It is quite well written though.

" I've put off reading this book for awhile. No reason really I had heard good things about it that it was full of symbolism etc. So now I've finally gotten around to reading it and while I do admit it was chock full of symbolism I didn't find it particularly engrossing and even a bit dull.After a wreck a group of boys twelve years and younger are stranded on an island. From the first they are eager to make their own society without the yoke of adults while still secretly yearning to be rescued. A boy named Ralph is made head of this society with Jack a leader of a choir group turned hunters as his somewhat second in command. He also has a somewhat adviser dubbed Piggy who owns a pair of glasses that is the main source for creating fire. As the boys live on the island their society starts to deteriorate and fears make the boys do things that no one would have ever thought them capable.Ralph is a weird leader for the group. He seems in the beginning to be more along the same lines of personality as Jack. A bully in a way but really just a normal boy otherwise. Piggy is the typical picked on kid who has aspects of him that are important to share but are ignored by society based on superficial reasoning. And Jack well he's the type that's filling up our prisons or operating under camouflage as a socio-path in the normal world. It's just in this world he is allowed to have the savagery come out. Ralph's experience with leading causes him to miss the socio-pathic role but he could have come very close if he had made a few decisions in a different way. And then there's Simon who's supposed to be the enigma of the group but who's really just a sick little boy that is looked at differently because of his issues.Golding uses this book to show a number of things. The bleakness in society the potential for violence in anyone and that without consequences to rules society could fall apart quite easily. But there were a couple things I didn't understand. For one I never really realized why it was all boys that were stranded on the island especially since they weren't all traveling as part of the group like the choir was. Why did they go to savagery so quickly? Especially when you consider the amount of younger kids. And what about their feelings of home and wanting to get back there? Surely after a week or so the fun of playing on their own island would have abated and a depression would have set in. And that just seems unaccounted for. While I thought Golding made some good points about society and how it works I just think it could have been fleshed out more.And the writing itself. For all the violence and gore I found it dull. Just the style was hard to follow because of the way it jumped about. And while part of that can be attributed to following the actions of young boys it was just jarring to read and made it easy to lose focus. And I know this book could actually be geared to middle school and high school aged children but I wonder if the majority have the ability to really get at all the symbolism in this book or if they'll be so distracted by the gore that it'll be missed. Certainly there are some very intelligent kids out there that will get it but not everyone is like that. Heck I'm an adult and I probably didn't catch half of what Golding put in there.There are some lessons in here but it just wasn't the right platform for me. I didn't like Golding's writing style and it caused me to hurry through a book that should have time spent on it to get at the detail.Lord of the FliesCopyright 1954182 pagesReview by M.

" I read this book in 6th grade as part of an 'advanced' program. I wish I hadn't read it quite that early; I might have enjoyed it more. I found it hard to get past the graphic descriptions of blood and gore and to the meat of the story. I do suggest it however; it seemed like an interesting book. (Being a 6th grade girl I wasn't so into the 'blood and gore more and more' thing.)It does contain some disturbing subject matter so it's probably not for kids. (Mature 8th graders and above would be my recommendation.) All in all though Golding describes what happens when society falls apart very vividly and portrays the savageness of humanity gone wrong very well. ",3.0
" The author's purpose for writing this book is to send a message to the readers. I agree with his message because it informs you of how cruel people can be. I think the literary element the author handled best was the characters. They were very well described by their looks as well as their actions. This book was believable because the way the story was written because it has real personalities as real people. For example when people are in a group they change to fit in just like the characters in the story they all became savages. This book was 'less than perfect' because it didn't have any girls and the ending was not very elaborate either. I would fix the flaws by adding more things like girls to see how they would react and be more elaborate in the ending. If I were to rate this book it would be fair. ",3.0
" I think the author was trying to say that without rules there would be total chaos.Thats just like if there was no rules in school there would be total chaos.

I would probably change the part when simon was talking to the pigs head though.It could sound a little more realistic. ",3.0
" In the book Lord of the Flies Golding is trying to show how evil comes out of people when they fear the unknown. I agree with the message he is trying to send out to the readers because people are scared of what they don;t know and sometimes handle it in a crazy behavior. I think he handled the characters very well because you can see how different they are from each other and how much evil they they have in themselves.

The type of person that I think that would like the book the most is the adventurous type.I think the purpose for writing the book was to show that without authority there would be total chaos. I agree with the message because when the kids got used to not having a parental figure around they did what they wanted. The element that was handled best was the climax because of how detailed he explained every thing that was going on. This book was very believable because you're always hearing about people getting into plane crashes and they were standed on an island for a long period of time and they had to use a lot of survival skills.The book was less than perfect because in the middle of action Golding jumps to something totally different. I would fix these flaws by continuing until the action is over. All in all this book was an ok book to read. ",3.0
" This book was really great and I would suggest to my friends to read this book. At first I didn't like it but when everything started happening I really started to enjoy the book. My teacher also made the book very fun to read becasue she put alot of energy into it. The more energy you use to read the book the better it is. The only thing I disagreed with in the book was that Ralph was the leader. I thought with the help of RalphPiggy would have been the best leader because he was the smartest one in the group. I also think Golding did a good job writing this book. He used alot of themes that are in society todayand made me think what if something like that could happen what would it be like. Trust me if you read this book you will be very impressed. One Love and Peace Out!! ",3.0
" The Lord of the Flies portrays the wicked sinful nature of man. In the beggining of the tale the boys are proper and organized. As it progresses however the boys become blood thirsty murderers. Ralph is the leader of the civilized tribe but later loses control to Jack. Jack's tribe hunts for food and has a fort while Ralph tries to keep a smoke signal alive. Jack's tribe kills two of Ralph's friends and plans to kill Ralph...This book shows the evil nature of man and how it can easily get out of control. ",3.0
" I don't know how somebody could live with themselves if they believe the message of this book. Lord of the Flies is brilliantly written and chocked full of symbolism.

" Lord of the flies shows perfectly the dynamics of a group of military schoolboys. Changing as the line of command deteriorates. When they are put on the island after a plane crash. At first they follow reason make a signal fire collect food make shelter so that if there is a storm they will have somewhere to go. The two main powers are Ralph and jack. Ralph seems to the others to be a constricting adult. He pressures them to work and collect fruit tend to the fire instead of running around and playing games on the beach or hunting pigs to eat. Jack is the solution to this he offers a separate tribe to join instead. They paint their faces hide in wait of pigs and develop strategies to track them down. Eventually tempted by the new power most of the boys move over to jacks tribe because they are sick of work and want meat instead of fruit to eat. When there are only a few left with Ralph. Ralph and piggy try to confront the lack of interest in getting rescued also piggy needs his glasses back. There is a scene where piggy gets a rock dropped on him and Ralph fights with jack. As a spear glances off his side Ralph turns and runs to hide in a thick thorn bush the next day when they hunt him. His friends who were forced into the other tribe betray him and before he can be smoked out he breaks their ranks. Later he hides under another bush in a shadow but Rodger finds him. As they chase Ralph shelters are bursting into flame.The ending leaves you hanging you don't really know what is going to happen I didn't really like that though you do get to just make it up yourself. They kill each other. Piggy Simon and one other a boy with a mark on his face goes missing early on. As soon as the navel officer is on the beach they just stop forget that they are all savages or perhaps they remember that killing is wrong and they should have been organized. With the words' what have you been doing?' they all change. Also the torture of am and Eric with spears into joining the tribe and leaving Ralph by himself.The whole book Ralph and Jack are fighting each other this seems to be more of the storyline then the obvious one of boys being stuck on an island and what they do. It Seems that its the fight between their morals and hope on being rescued. Ralph gets his hope from piggy and Jack to help ease the pain of never being rescued starts the tribe of hunters. Then he can take out his pain on tracking the pigs and learning the art of hunting.Lastly Simon talking to a pigs head is just plain weird and i can understand why they take it out of the book for the movie except that this is the only reason that the book is called lord of the flies.

" Again another book tagged as an 'enduring classic' is to be blunt a disspointment and at many times a horrible bore. I myself do not really appreciate the writing stlye of Golding. It seemed to me all of his quotes ended like this-- This was very frustrating to read giving me the feeling more was to be said but was never written often bringing me off track while i was reading trying to wonder what the character was trying to say and i would realize i had read a page or 2 and had not the slightest clue of what i read. Another problem that i found within this book was the sheer number of unimportant characters the continually are mentioned. Characters with no background or character development are often named making me feel as though i missed something again taking me off track of my reading. Overall the story itself has an interesting idea in my opinion this interesting story is quite frankly ruined by the poor quality of Golding's writing. A frustrating read filled with obscure as well as obvious symbollism I would not recommend it. ",3.0

" William Golding's 'Lord of the Flies' is about a group of young children stranded on an uninhabited island who are forced to create their own civilization and survive. The novel while somewhat predictable and easy to understand is filled with many important uses of symbolism. In the opening Piggy finds a conch shell and uses it to bring order to the group and the conch shell continues to symbolize order throughout the novel. However when Piggy is killed later on in the novel the conch shell is destroyed also symbolizing the end of order. The 'Lord of the Flies' a severed pig's head symbolizes the cruelty and brutality that the members of Jack's group possess. Throughout the novel there are many parallels that are made between the boy's civilization on the island and civilization as a whole. This novel is easy to read right through and not fully understand its entire purpose but I believe William Golding's purpose for this novel is to provide an understanding of the evils of civilization and government.

" My Thoughts on 'Lord Of The Flies' Is that it brings so much insight and can help us understand ourselves better. The story is so great; it shows how nature and man can combine together and accomplish good or evil. Golding brings these kids on this island where they will have to face many challenges and fight with life and death.He brings mankind and civilization together and makes the island like a war against nature. My opinion is when he creates the plots and description of the story he describes the characters and the island and the plots so well. I like how he makes the story like giving us a sigh of the world we live in today on how the world can be so cruel and evil but the outcome of it can be very good. Overall this was a very great book.

" Golding's purpose for writing this story was he meant to send a message out to the readers. He wanted to let us know what it would be like to be free without rules and authority. I think Golding handled setting and symbolism best out of all the literary elements in the book. He described the island so good it makes you visualize what it looks like. Golding also used lots of symbolism helping to explain why certain things happened in the story. Golding wanted to show how young boys would react to being alone and in charge of themselves. It is a good book and enjoyable..I encourage you to read it if you like semi adventure and realism. ",3.0

" Lord of the Flies is brilliant of that there is no doubt. It's painfully realistic and I have no doubt that events on Golding's little fictional Pacific island could have unfolded exactly the way he led them to unfold.

" The book 'Lord of the Flies' is a very interesting book. This book has it ups and downs. I think that the only way that you would be able to enjoy this book is if you start thinking deeper into the story. I liked this book because you can think deeper into it and it makes sense and it explains a lot. If you think deeper into the story then you can enjoy the book so much more.This book is pretty much a allegory book. An allegory is a story or tale with two or more levels of meaning-a literal and a symbolic meaning. The characters in the book stand for something else. This is a hard book to understand for that reason. Once you thin it through and think of what the characters could be resembling then you can understand the book more. I didnt understand the book until my teacher started telling the class that the characters stand for something or the symbolize something and then I understood it and got into it a lot more.So if you are looking for a book where it gets you to think and it has a deeper meaning then this is the book for you. If not the I dont think that this book is for you. ",3.0
" When I fisrt heard of the story and of the ideabehind this book I thought it could really be agreat novel. The main idea is to propose a metaphor of what our societies are like but from the point of view of children lost on a desert island. They 'build' their own little society with a chief and people who have to do some tasks if they want to survive. Well the setting sounds really cool doesn't it?That's why I wanted to read this book and I was not compelled to read it by one of my teachers. But when I finished it I was very disappointed. The basic idea is great but the way it is developed is flawed. You just have kids who go crzay and wild because there are no more adults above them to tell them what to do or not. And moreover when trying to show us a bit of what is our history and an insight into the development of our civilizations Golding forget many very important things along the way.As a matter of fact there are no women on the island (or well no little girl to fall in love with).

At first they are successful but in the end they fail miserably. The group splits into savage vs. civil and things get crazy. Although I wouldn't consider this book one of my favorites I liked the way the boys' struggle represents real struggles that go on in the world. There are many themes in this book and in general the book mirrors human nature and the realities of our civilization today. In the end everyone in the book did what made them happy even if it didn't work for the group. Our world today is much like this people are mostly concerned about themselves. There are many conflicts in this book between leaders and followers order and chaos work and play. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes action and conflict.

" Lord of the Flies is a worthwhile book that could have used an editor with just a little more aggressiveness. The first hundred ninety-nine pages are excellent. Golding has wonderful insight into the human condition and he applies it with rare grace and tact. And then we get to the final page which would be best ripped out.

" Lord of the flies was a fairly good book. It is about a group of boys who land on a desserted island after their plane has crashed. No adults had survived the plane wreck so the kids are without any adult supervision.

But they cannot all get along and when Jack starts his own hunting tribe the group of boys split. The boys in Jack's group always wanting to hunt quickly turn into fierce savages. So fierce that others are endangered of being killed.

Through the whole book I wanted them to do things so they could be saved but the majority of them didn't care. ",3.0
" I recommend this book for high school students who enjoy to read. It is a good book for a person who likes a little bit of adventure and some excitement. The one thing I did not like about this book is it does get dull during the middle of the book but it picks up a little bit in the end. It should be a book that you would want to read instead of being forced too. ",3.0
" I'm a student who was just required to read Lord of the Flies. I personally thought the plot was good. I liked the charaters in the book. I think though that maybe the author has a similar problem in writing to myself. I know I get a good idea and cannot write it down the way I want it. I'm sure the original idea was a great one. Maybe if I reread this book at a later time in my life I may be able to like it better. I'm not sure. Over all I'd tell you to read it because its a book about survival from the elements from oneself and contains a large amount of action within its pages. ",3.0
" this novel was extremely intersting and had great symbolism. great choice!! ",3.0
" I think the author was trying to tell us that everyone has some kind of evil inside them. I agree with him because everyone isn't perfect. The best literary element in the book was the characters. I like how each character had its own great personality.It was a believable because without rules crazy things like that can happen. The book could of be better if the begining was so slow and had more action in it. Overall i really liked the book. ",3.0
" Lord of the flies was a book about a group of kids that plain crashes on an island and they get stuck their.The kids have no grownups around so they have to do everything for themslves.They try to establish rules but after a while nobody listens to the rules and all hell breaks out. I think the authors purpose for writing the book was to show how people can turn savage in a short period of time without anyone to enforce the rules.I do agree with his message because society's do need rules or else things like what happened in the book will happen every day. In the book I think that the author handled the characters very well.There were many charactersand he described them and their personality very well.I think Golding is a great author. This book is very believable to me because a plane could crash on a deserted island and kids could have to take care of themselves with no grownups around.It all is possible. I think that Golding did a great job with this book and it is fine how it is written. ",3.0
" The novel The Lord of the Flies by William Golding is a novel in which some boys get stranded on an island and they are trying to find their way off the island. To read this book and completly usnderstand this novel you should and almost have to be a very intellectual person and you have to be a deep person. There is some symbolism that is very difficult to understand and without a teacher or someone who understands the book telling you what it is about it could be very confusing. The book however had very good discription and was very well written. It made you feel like you were actually there with them and feeling their struggles and difficulties. I felt their frustration with each other. Can you imagine if you were stranded on this island and you had no adults no parents and no sense of government? I felt as if the book was never ending and it dragged on way too long. I didn't enjoy reading it therefore I really didn't put a lot of energy trying to figure out what the author was trying to say. I also am not a girl for ficton books and I usually don't like books that we have to read in school. If I were to read this book I would deffenitly go in with a different mind set. I would go in with the mind set that this book is very difficult to read and that I have to foucs a lot to see the hidden symbolism and theme within the book. I enjoyed the scenery that was set up and the discription used to describe events. I recommend this book to anyone who has great understanding finding hidden symbolism and picking out the theme. Be prepared for a some what difficult novel yet thrilling. Be intense while reading this book! ",3.0
" The book Lord of the Flies written by William Golding is a very well written book. The genre of the book is historical fiction. The setting of the book is on an uncharted island during the WorldWarII era. The book is mainly about a couple of schoolboys who crash-landed on an uncharted island that they are stranded on without any adults. I think the theme of the book was to show that society cannot run correctly because of the natural sinful nature of man. Some of the main characters are Piggy Ralph and Jack. Piggy and Ralph first meet when they when they wake up next to each other after the landing. Piggy is a chubby little bossy kid while Ralph on the other hand is a mellow and relaxed cool kind of kid. They call together all of the kids that are on the island including a boy named Jack. Jack is a stuck up kid who is a prefect at his school and is the captain of his choir class. While the short lived bond of Piggy and Ralph's friendship becomes weaker Jack and Ralph who are both leaders seem to get along very well. Piggy and Ralph were friends but when a person like Jack shows up a more strong leader-like and Ralph-like kid is up to be Ralph's friend Ralph quickly ignores Piggy to become Jack's friend. But as Jack and Ralph's friendship grows the contest for leadership of the tribe of kids grows even more. Even though the kids already voted for Ralph to be the chief Jack is starting to show that he could be a better chief. I believe this because all Ralph has ever cared for is to keep the fire going and keep the hope of being rescued alive. While Jack a more ferocious boy focuses on staying alive most of the time and hunting for the hard to get meat. I think that this book is best recommended for older teenagers because most of the words in the book are very complex and because of the violence that happens. The book Lord of the Flies is a very interesting book. Even though it has some very confusing words and hard to understand material it should be given a try. ",3.0
" I read Lord of the Flies one time for school. When I first started reading it I didn't like it that much but I thought it wasn't too bad. Some parts were really interesting but some were boring. I thought it really started to get my attention towards the end when a lot of interesting things started to happen but I didn't really like the first half. If you didn't have to read this when you were in school I would recommend giving it a try. But I suggest to read it all the way through to get the full enjoyment of it though. ",3.0
" Lord of the Flies is a story about sverel young boys who were stranded on an island with no adults. The story tells about how they developed leaders and routine for their lives. It was a well written book although sometimes it was hard to follow. Some portions were a bit disturbing but it kept me entertained and that takes a lot. I'd say this book is like Peter Pan meets Cast Away. It was a wonderful story on adventure and survival. ",3.0
" I didn't know anything about LOTF before I read it except that it was foundational to many other works controversial and highly recommended. As far as a story goes it's engaging. The characters aren't anything special from a literary perspective. I'm not a big person on reading into the symbolism behind everything in a book so much of the appeal and social critique of LOTF was lost on me. Some parts were confusing and I'm still trying to figure out why the title is what it is (the pig head on the pole seemed like a minor incident).At the end I was left with a feeling of 'meh.' But that's just me. If you want fun and adventure you're probably best to look elsewhere. If you want to read a critique of human nature and the fall of society you've got it. If you haven't read this 'classic' and need to check it off your list enjoy. ",3.0
" When I started reading this book I was happy to look for adventure of a bunch of young kids/men stranded on an island without any support or knowledge of survival instincts. Then the story takes a turn by showing how human behavior creates anger jealousy and hunger for control. The key of the book is how do people react when left to survive without controls governments aka survival in nature.The writing style is smart vivid and exceptionally detailed. The author describes every movement colour geography and person in detail.The plan is simple- put kids from various backgrounds in order to get a bag full of characters possible.Read this to realise how we end up behaving when there is no control and the dark side our human mind is capable off ",3.0
" In my seventh grade English class we have just finished reading a great book called Lord of the Flies by William Golding. He wrote this book with unbelievable description which would either catch your eye or put you to sleep in class. For me it was more like putting myself to sleep. That doesn't mean it wasn't a good book I just think it was in my opinion a book more for adults. Besides the description the plot was well written. I enjoyed how he used Piggy to get the theme across.Mr. Golding put lots of thought into the book when writing description. From describing the ocean blue all the way to describing Piggy's looks and attitudes. Examples of this can be found throughout the book literally there is no page without description. A description on a tree could even go on for 3 pages. Personally that was what lost my interest. An example I found was on page 169 where it says 'The twins watched anxiously and Piggy sat expressionless behind the luminous wall of his myopia.' This shoes both the scenery and Piggy's attitude which is stubborn. This shows his stubbornness because the author says he was sitting expressionless which is usually what I do when I'm frustrated. Another good description Golding had was on page 158 where it says 'The air was heavy with unspoken knowledge.' This is showing the tension between Piggy and the other people on the island who are not listening to him.I enjoyed how he used Piggy to get the theme across because of the way he left Piggy there just open. I can compare Piggy to an unlocked door that people just walk by they will never know what they have just missed. That is what happened to Piggy they didn't expect anything from him just because of his obesity and judged him just by that which is plain wrong. Just because it is wrong many people do it in present day it must just be a natural judgment. But really Piggy is a smart kid. In my opinion I believe that they would have gotten off the island if they just let Piggy be leader or at least do more work. In my opinion the theme was 'Use what you have don't make assumptions and you always have something.' That is the first thing they did when they saw Piggy make fun of him. They let that fly past their heads and assumed he wouldn't help. Really he was their key to success and knowledge. They always had him there but just left him hanging.So if you are thinking about buying this book or not I would say go ahead. Anyways the most you have to lose is a few dollars. Maybe if you don't like description then just don't even bother but if you adore description then defiantly try this book. You will finish it and realize that book really wasn't that bad after all.

" The author's purpose for writing this book is to send a message to the readers. I agree with his message because it informs you of how cruel people can be. I think the literary element the author handled best was the characters. They were very well described by their looks as well as their actions. This book was believable because the way the story was written because it has real personalities as real people. For example when people are in a group they change to fit in just like the characters in the story they all became savages. This book was 'less than perfect' because it didn't have any girls and the ending was not very elaborate either. I would fix the flaws by adding more things like girls to see how they would react and be more elaborate in the ending. If I were to rate this book it would be fair. ",3.0

" 'Lord of the Flies' is displayed as a remarkable novel. The plot shows suspense adventure and thrills. As the novel slowly uncovers itself each of the character's inside personality also slowly reveals. The novel shows the extent of action humans would take for survival and the wide and vague diverse personalities different people contain within.Once the reader picks up the book they would be enthralled in the novel and would feel trapped within. The words are used so intensely that the reader will often feel as if they are part of the story. This novel is beautifully written and the plot is presented in a unique manner.'Lord of the Flies' is a rather tragic and frightening novel. The protagonist goes through never-ending adventures for the hope of survival. The antagonist does whatever it takes to get rid of the protagonist and would go far beyond imagination. Even though the protagonist was a static character unfortunately the antagonist is thought to be a dynamic character that turns evil through a twist of fate. ",3.0
" Lord of the Flies is an imaginative novel that I recommend to all patient readers. I believe in this novel like others I have read published in this period has a slow paced plot that does not have incredible amounts of action. In this book it is sometimes necessary to read two chapters before something exciting accure. For this reason I feel the book may leave something to be desired among the new generation of readers. However I feel that William Golding does a great job of creating the beautiful yet traitorous terrain and characters on the island. Overall this book deserves its crown as one of the best books of its type in the 20th Century. ",3.0
" Lord of the flies is a book based on survival--the strong overcoming the weak. A bunch of boys crash into a deserted island and slowly become very primitive. When Jack separates the boys into two different tribes they transform from civil to barbaric. The two groups begin to turn on one another. Farther into the book the fighting increases and the tribes really start to break away from one another.The point of this book is that mankind thinks that their society is civilized but it is still very primitive. The world today is still based on survival; the strong overcome the weak. Even now one angry word and our society becomes barbaric. Sometimes wars start and friendships end just by saying the wrong words. As each day passes the boys start to destroy one another. Simple words between some of the boys end up agitating the tribes and battles ensue.The Toronto School Board banned this classic from all its schools citing that it was racist for use of the word 'niggers.' As I was looking at all the banned books I noticed how many are banned for their language. I understand some of this language is harsh but that is how society acts. These words help to express the anger the tribes are feeling. Without these words the reader will never fully understand the hatred between the tribes. ",3.0
" Lord of the Flies is a very deep and symbolic novel perhaps too much of one to really be entertaining. While i did enjoy the basic storyline Lord of the Flies was written in a way that i found extremely confusing and basically uninteresting. The parts of it that i acctually understood weren't so bad though.In the start of the novel a lot of young boys find themselves trapped on an island with no adults. In the first few days that they are there they elect a leader set up rules and get an organized camp going. They seem to be used to having rules and regualtions and no one objects to this. There are some important main characters in this book. Ralph is the civilized rational figure who is elected cheif in the beginning. He knows what needs to be done to get rescued and throuout the book he is focused on that. Then there is Jack who turns out to be the 'bad guy'. He wants to be the cheif and he really isn't interested in doing productive things he wants to hunt instead. Piggy is the wise figure in this novel. His ideas always are the obviously correct thing to do but because he is somewhat of a nerd no one really listens to him and most of what he says is shot down.Throuought this book civilization goes down the drain. Jack eventually breaks off from the rest of the group with his hunters and soon enough all the boys except for the little ones Piggy and Ralph join his tribe to feast dance and have fun.The conch the shell that symbolized organization and power in the start of the novel is smashed into thousands of pieces which shows us that the morals and society of the boys has completely died. The beast which all the boys are afraid of symbolizes the fear that we all have of the unknown. It seemed that every word in Lord of the Flies had some deep hidden meaning which i felt made the book tedious and confusing. Yes it is a good book but would i read it again? No. ",3.0

" This book is an important book of what happens in a society when there are no rules or any guide lines to follow. Ever since the boys were placed on the island they were destined to fail at creating their own perfect environment. The setting they are in starts out as a good fun environment to them but by all of the boys hunger for power it turns them against eachother and turns this so called 'good' island into a 'bad' island.Jack is a representation of evil by how he thirsts for blood and meat as a opposed to being rescued. He would let the fire go out which is their only chance for survival just to cut open a pig. Ralph represents good by trying to create order shelter and a way to be rescued. Jacks group takes over the island creating the human motivation for evil and hunting. Ralph being the only one left his motivation is forced into surviving as opposed to creating order. The whole island turns to chaos when just one person takes control. This person represents the devil figure and he takes down everyone on the whole island except for Ralph. This book shows how important rules and order are in a society today. It also shows how human motivation can completely take over the whole human body and let barbaric things happen that would not happen in a normal oderly society today. ",3.0
" Lord of the Flies is a very enjoyable book. It is a book that you would enjoy reading if you like analyzing day-to-day life in your litature. The way Golding makes the boys on the island symbolize people and actions in the real world is what makes the book so good. I origianly thought the book was gooing to be boring and hard to catch on to but after I got into the book I wanted to know more about the characters and what was going to happen next. If you dont like putting yourself into your reading then you would not like this book. The plot in this story is always changing because right when you thilnk something predictable is going to happen golding puts a spin on how they characters act or what their next action is going to be. Overall I thought Lord of the Flies is a good book. ",3.0

They choose Ralph as their leader and Ralph appoints Jack to be in charge of food.Ralph Jack and another boy Simon  set off on an expedition to explore the island. When they return Ralph says that they should light a signal fire to attract the attention of passing ships. The boys ignite some dead wood by reflecting sunlight through the lenses of Piggy's eyeglasses. The boys are playing rather than monitoring the fire and the fir engulf the forest. One of the youngest boys in the group disappears during the fire never returning presumably having burned to death.One day a ship passes and Ralph and Piggy notice that the signals fire which had been the hunters' responsibility to maintain has burned out. Furious Ralph accosts Jack but the hunter has just returned with his first kill. Piggy criticizes Jack who hits Piggy across the face. Ralph blows the conch shell and scolds the boys in a speech intended to restore order. At the meeting it quickly becomes clear that some of the boys have started to become afraid. The littlest boys known as the littluns have had nightmares from the beginning and more and more boys now believe that there is some sort of beast or monster on the island. The older boys try to convince the others at the meeting to think rationally asking where such a monster could possibly hide during the daytime. One of the littluns suggests that it hides in the sea. Not long after the meeting some military planes battle high above the island. The boys asleep below do not notice the flashing lights and explosions in the clouds. A parachutist drifts down on the mountain. Sam and Eric are responsible for watching the fire at night they are asleep and do not see the parachutist land. When the twins wake up they see the enormous shadow of his parachute and hear the strange flapping noises it makes. Thinking the island beast is at hand they rush back to the camp in terror. Jack and Ralph travel up the mountain.. The group holds a meeting at which Jack and Ralph tell the others of the sighting. Jack says that Ralph is a coward and that he should be removed from office but the other boys refuse to vote Ralph out of power. Jack angrily runs away down the beach calling all the hunters to join him. Ralph rallies the remaining boys to build a new signal fire this time on the beach rather than on the mountain. They obey but before they have finished most of them have slipped away to join Jack.Jack declares himself the leader of the new tribe of hunters and organizes a hunt of a pig a violent slaughter followed by sowing the head to a stick as a offering to the beast. Later encountering the bloody fly-covered head Simon has a terrible vision during which it seems to him that the head is speaking. The voice says that Simon will never escape him for he exists within all men. Simon faints. When he wakes up he goes to the mountain where he sees the dead parachutist. Understanding then that the beast does not exist. Simon travels to the beach to tell the others what he has seen. But the others are in the middle of a chaotic revelry when they see Simon's shadowy figure emerge from the jungle they fall upon him and kill him with their bare hands and teeth.Ralph hides for the rest of the night and the following day while the others hunt him like an animal.. Ralph collapses in exhaustion after being chased out of the forest but when he looks up he sees a British naval officer standing over him. The officer's ship noticed the fire raging in the jungle. The other boys reach the beach and stop in their tracks at the sight of the officer. Amazed at the spectacle of this group the officer asks Ralph to explain. Ralph is overwhelmed by the knowledge that he is safe but thinking about what has happened on the island he begins to weep. The other boys begin to sob as well.I enjoyed reading this book it was very interesting and had a lot of action in it. I liked how the ending began with the plane going down and the boys being stranded on the island. Another favorite part of the book was towards the end when all the boys break up and they are fighting. Overall this was a good book to read and I would recommend it to anyone. ",3.0

" Imagine you are trapped on an island with a group of boys. What do you do? How do you survive?William Golding's novel 'Lord of the Flies' was written in 1954. It is an action/adventure book about a group who suffer a horrific plane crash and the boys are stranded on an island during the World War II era. The tale involves the struggle of power between two boys. Ralph is just your average male just looking for law and order. Jack on the other hand is a constant slave to power.Just imagine what boys would do when stranded by themselves. One thing they do is paint their faces and turn into savages. The book brings you on a journey of boys trying to survive or will they just be boys and play forgetting about the fight for survival?Golding shows us that everything has a good and evil side. The book does have its twists and turns and some things will surprise you. Despite all of the entertainment I felt this book was very predictable. What else could you get in a story about people stranded on an island? This does not necessarily mean it is not a good book though. I guess you can only judge it by reading it for your self. ",3.0
" With no parents teachers or rules is there really any question as to why the characters in Lord of the Flies by William Golding had no mercy? The story is about a group of English boys on their way to boarding school when their plane gets shot down in the middle of World War II and end up stranded on an island. They try to form a society and govern themselves but not long after the boys are having chaos for breakfast and anarchy for lunch. The book reminds me of the movie Thirteen only the male version. In Thirteen the main character goes to shocking lengths to befriend the most popular girl in school. Before her mother knows it she is powerless to rescue her daughter from a whirlwind of drugs sex and crime). They both I find are not shocking at all. This is the way people today are to say you were shocked is saying your living your life blind. Ralph is your typical guy in high school who is unsure of himself and just watches the bully pick on the little kid. Jack on the other hand is the jock/bully who everyone 'admires' whether it is in fear or respect. Simon is the artsy type. He is out of the box and in his won world. Piggy a very intelligent boy would be your 'nerd' who stands up for what he believes in. The Lord of the Flies is a well written book full of truth. When you read the story don't be disgusted. Ask yourself 'what would I do if I were twelve years old and stranded on an island?' ",3.0
" I read Lord of the Flies knowing it's a classic and for the most part I thought it was pretty good. It details the story of young boys stranded on an island after a plane crash. At first the primary character of the novel Ralph heads the dictatorship that begins but as time passes Ralph comes to blow with Jack. Where Ralph sees the boys' primary concern being signaling a passing ship for help Jack is concerned with hunting. So two groups emerge with Ralph and Jack as the leaders. After that some very dramatic and interesting happenings take place as the reader sees savagery and visciousness develop amongst the boys.The only real problem I had with the story was the lack of explanation about the boys. The novel starts after the plane crash has taken place and the author never offers an explanation for who these boys are or where they were going. Also I found it somewhat unrealistic the way in which the boys seemed to get along so well on their own. They didn't seem nearly as frightened as I'd imagine boys would be in their place in reality.Overall I say this book is worth reading if you're interested. It's not too long and has a pretty good story. ",3.0
" Now before I start let me just say that this book is not a bad book just an overrated oneThis is an O.K although it bored me when i read it in High School I wondered why we just couldn't have read 'Return of the Native' or something better I don't know why it is on required reading lists nor why it was made into two movies. I guess when you pick apart every syllable and say it means something profound then it does. As for a plot that means anything or charecters that make the slightest bit of sense well lets just forget that.At best you have a harrowing tale about kids being trapped on an island losing their identify here the become a mycocausum for different types of society.

" I read this book in high school and didn't like it at first because it was a little tough for me and the attempts to get off the island seemed to drag on to the point where I no longer cared if they got off the island at all but then I read it again and seemed to like it. It was a favorite for most of the students in my class so I decided to give the novel another try and I'm glad I did...I read this book a second time very quickly as I was intrigued by everything that went on in LOTF and I learned a valuable lesson in that if you don't come together in a time of need you will suffer and also that we sometimes fear what will happen and fear to help others so we are classified as 'beasts' I found something valuable the second time I read this novel rather than the first go around...Do read this book..I think you will enjoy it and get a lot from it.

" In my opinion Golding's reasons for writing this book are to show that there is an inner beast in everyone. I agree with his message because there is a point in everyone's day or life that their true beast comes out. The best literary elements that Golding uses were foreshadowing and symbolism. He uses symbolism the best in the way he used Piggy's glasses to reveal a sign of vision. Not just eye-sight but the sight of seeing things clearly. Piggy was the only one on the island that had a clear vision of life and he was also able to see that rules are needed in life for things to work out and for there not to be any serious conflicts. L.O.F. is a very realistic book because if any number of people were stranded on an island without any rules there would be absolute chaos. People would be power hungry like Jack. There would be a few people that thought that rules were neccessary to survive like Piggy.They would eventually turn into worrying about themselves and getting only what they need to survive in life. I think the book could have had a better ending. A reader from LBHS (Long Branch High School)! ",3.0
" Golding's purpose for writing Lord Of The Flies was to show mankind at its worst and how human nature can go wrong. Golding's message was that there is evil inside of us all. Golding is correct in this manner but I thing that everyone has good in them too. In Golding's Lord of the Flies he handled the characters the best. The characters were all well developed and each one represented a different aspect of human nature",3.0
" I think that the author's purpose for writing this book was to tell how to survive in the world/forest without adult supervision. I agree because the boys would have needed to learn how to survive without supervision sooner or later in their lifetime. In this book I think that the author used climax best because it got extremely intense as it got closer to the end of the book. I liked the intenseness in the book a lot. This book was believable to me. It was believable because the events that took place really could have happened. The only thing that could not have taken place was that an airplane was attacked than crashed and no adults survived any of it. I also think that the book was less than perfect. It was good writing and good reading. I rate this book fair. ",3.0
" Listening to this novel doesn't improve it. You get the added bonus track of Golding groaning on and on and on about how he got the inspiration for this overly simplistic morality tale.

" The book Lord of the Flies is a story about a group of kids getting stranded on a deserted island and how they survive without adults. I didn't like the way that many of the kids went crazy. I know you are stranded on a deserted island but i don't believe that you would just go crazy like that. I know that being on an island like that would probably make you alittle crazy but not enough to brutally kill two of your peers. They all knew that in order to be survive they needed to maintain order. I don't believe they would just betray their elected leader just to have some fun. As for the characters I like Ralph. He handled himself well in the situtation. I did his best to maintain as much order as he could. You could tell that Ralph was had the potential for a good leader. Jack on the other hand I did't like. At first he seemed like he was a nice kid but then he turned on Ralph and formed his own tribe. I couldn't believe when kids actually followed him. Then he got everyone to turn on Ralph who was just trying to keep order on the island. At one point Ralph gives in to Jack and goes to have a feast with him. They then kill Simon because they thought it was the monster running down the beach. Jack just made things out of control with his new tribe. He turned everyone into killers. I like Piggy for one reason because he was the only one to stay with Ralph. This eventually got him killed but he was loyal to the leader that he elected. Beside that he was that great of a character. He seemed like he would get on your nerves after awhile. Thats mainly the reason I didn't like his character that much. The ending of the book was horrible. I was expecting something more to happen than for them to just get rescued. That is the main reason i didn't like this book ",3.0

" Briefly for those of you that don't know Lord of the Flies is a book about a group of boys who are stranded on an island. At first they get along but as the book progresses they fight and kill each other.Well this was a book I had to read for school. I felt that chapters 1-7 were boring 8-10 were okay and 11 and 12 were boring. It had some exciting moments but it had many times more boring moments. There was really no one to root for no good guy you cared to see to live until the end. In other words I couldn't have cared less if they all died. There is a whole lot of symbolism. Actually I am going to have to cut this review short 'caue I have to work on notes about the allusions in it. Its due tommorow ( uh-oh ).Anyway if you are the type of person who enjoys sitting around reading boring books this book is for you!Oh- oops. I just read the rules. This nice little review couldn't ever qualify for a prize. I guess I should explain where Golding went wrong. Well I thought that at points it kind of rambled on. As I said before there wasn't anyone that you really could root for. I think that if Golding had created some sort of wonderful character that was nice to everyone heroic smart not afraid then you would want to turn the pages to see if they would leave. Well now I really got to go and work on those notes! ",3.0
" Imagine you are trapped on an island with a group of boys. What do you do? How do you survive?William Golding's novel 'Lord of the Flies' was written in 1954. It is an action/adventure book about a group who suffer a horrific plane crash and the boys are stranded on an island. It takes place during the World War II era. The tale involves the struggle of power between two boys. One who's name is Ralph is just your average male just looking for law and order. Jack on the other hand is a constant slave to power.Just imagine what boys would do when stranded by themselves. One thing they do is paint their faces savagely kill pigs through their anuses and turn into savages. The book brings you on a journey of boys trying to survive or will they just be boys and play forgetting about the fight for survival.This book is very symbolic in meaning that everything has a good and evil side. The book does have its twists and turns and some things will surprise you. Despite all of the entertainment I felt this book was very predictable. What else could you get in a story about people stranded on an island? This does not necessarily mean it is not a good book though. I guess you can only judge it by reading it for your self. ",3.0
" Willam Goldings novel The Lord Of The Flies is a a intresting deep novel. It touches on alot of levels about society and how we act as people. The novel is about a group of young boys from Britain who are on a plane on their way to boarding school when it gets shot down and crashes on a island. There are four main characters Ralph who is the leader Piggy who is the smart one Jack the strong agressive one And Simon the naturalist relgious one. Through these boys you see the diffrent facets of society and how they are suppose to interact. During the time they spend on the island the rules of a civilized society start to fade away and brings out the primal instaincts in our human nature due to survial of the fittest.. I belive that this is a great novel to read and it displays the ideas of what would happen if societys rules were taken away and how we would function. Using children in stead of adults is also a great idea for it shows that even innocents can turn into savage beasts. ",3.0
" William Goldings Lord of the Flies is a thrill-seeking book. When reading Lord of the flies you will sit at the edge of your chair with the boys that try to fight for survival as their insanity takes over them. Roger Ralph Piggy Jack and Simon the boarding school boys who have just crash-landed on this island; with no parental guidance no rules and now have to learn how to get along with each other in order to get off. As Ralph and Jack battle it out for who will be leader one wants things to be in control and the other thrives to be in control of the others that are stranded too. Just as one-boy stumbles upon a beast we wonder just what could happen next. This is surely a remarkable book for boys to read if they are adventurous them selves. Over SEVEN MILLION copies were sold this book was such a realistic book I could see why. As you read this book you won't put it down because when the unknown of others on an island has you stranded together you must work your hardest to survive you will learn who will and who won't...... would you survive reading this book?

" Okay so this book is recommended. Exciting but boring at times. The beginning was very boring and it stayed that way until pretty far into the book. The excitement level went up and down after the beginning. (The end was very exciting.) (Spoiler alert!) The book ended very suddenly. That was a flaw that really bothered me. (End of spoiler!) This book was very intense towards the end. The kids are a little bit dumb. Except for a few of them.(No offense.) But it had great impact on the excitement so I can not call that a flaw. (Even though I was about to a second ago.) This book is pretty good. Check it out! ",3.0

" Lord of the Flies by William Golding was a great book that took some time to develop. I at first thought that this book would not keep my attention. As I read on I became more and more interested in this book. The idea of having a group of children varying in age stranded on an island was very fascinating. I didn't know how they would react to this situation they were placed in and that's part of the reason this book kept my interest.At first the kids thought it was fun not having any adult supervision. The boys agree to work together with Ralph trying to maintain order by assigning various chores such as keeping a signal fire going that they started with piggy's glasses and gathering food. However the chores stop being done and their society breaks down. This reaches its peak when Ralph sees a ship in the distance and the signal fire is out. The hunting boys were supposed to keep it going and before Ralph can scold them they come back with a kill. This turns the kid's loyalty toward Jack. I thought this was the most interesting part of this book. I enjoyed how it showed the struggle in society between order and lack of it. As jack gains power among the boys Ralph finds himself suddenly being hunted by his former friends. These kids turned savages show no remorse when they kill one of their own with there bare hands and teeth. I found it very compelling how these civilized kids can suddenly deliberately want to kill one of there former friends. However the reason I gave this book a three out of five was the ending. There was great action throughout the book and then it suddenly ends just by Ralph running out of the jungle to see a British Naval Officer.This books characters exemplify three distinct aspects of human nature. Jack shows mans roots in his primitive behavior. He opts to hunt and be free shirking the duties that could ultimately rescue him. Ralph's character shows the desire of man to be civilized yet be free and wild as well. He wants to be rescued but at other times is intrigued by the hunt and wild side of human nature. He shows his desire to be rescued by trying to keep order and have chores. Oppositely he is overwhelmed by the hunt and ultimately kills his friend in the fatal attack on the beach. Finally Piggy is on the opposite spectrum from Jack. He is constantly reminding the others of the proper way to act and mentions adult's behavior as an example. These characters represent the constant struggles that live inside mankind in everyday life.In conclusion this was a great book to read. The plot was exciting with the exception of the mundane ending. It is a book that can be read on many levels and with characters that represent struggles that continuously plague the human mind. I gave this book a three out of five and would recommend others to check it out. ",3.0
" The main thing that people rave about this book is its SYMBOLISM. Well I think that symbolism is based on your own opinion. We don't know that the author meant to have this particular thing represent this particular idea. When you get to the story itself the first four chapters and the last four chapters are worth a read. However everything in between I found to be very boring and you find yourself having to stop and re-read certain things because you forget what is happening; there is no action to help keep you up to speed.Just FYI I didn't have to read this book for school. I read it in my spare time. From what I understand those who must read it for school have a far lower opinion of this novel but I don't know that for a fact. ",3.0
" The Lord of the Flies begins in complete chaos. A group of young boys are stranded on a tropical island after their military school plane was shot down. All the adults onboard were killed so the boys were completely alone. Even without the supervision and direction of parents to help them the boys try to get organized. The pick a leader establish a set of 'laws' for the island and make plans for their survival.Throughout the book there is one boy who is rediculed at every chance and only one boy tries to defend him. There is a constant battle for power between the boys named Ralph who is sensible and only concerned with getting rescued and the boy called Jack who is a savage and only thinks of hunting pigs and having fun. After heated arguments that split the boys in two raids by the hunters that destroy Ralph's shelter and his only chance of making fire and the murder of two boys by Jack's tribe the battle escalates to a the whole island going up in flames while the hunters try to flush out their prey... Ralph.Golding uses a lot of desciption to make you feel as though this could actually happen. He creates a realistic microcosm (a little 'world' that represents a bigger world) with a government and a trouble-maker that shows what humans resort to in times of desperation. The climax of the book is a good surprise but it ends too quickly without enough explaination to understand it easily. I enjoyed the story but Golding repeats things too much and I didn't even like those parts when I read them the first time. Jack talks about hunting too much Ralph talks about keeping the fire going too much and I hate the song the hunters sing. It repeats killing the beast and spilling its blood over and over and they sing it all the time. Without these annoying repeats and the short boring periods spred throughout the book I would say that the Lord of the Flies is a great story (but it is not written like one.) ",3.0
" Getting right into the story William Golding has a good plot in the book 'Lord Of The Flies' but some how knew to how to make me unpatient. The story starts on an island where a plane crash of young British boys had occured. The sorty takes the reader through the horrors of how these boys had to work together to survive and what struggles they went through with each other. William Golding did a good job of showing how much different people are and what different goals people have. 'Loard Of The Flies' was a quick read for me yet it still made me impatient because the charactures kept repeating themselves. Ralf a leader in the book would always say 'we need to keep the fire going.' Jack another leader would always say 'we need to hunt.' Sure the book needed to state this so we could get to know the characters but we didn't need to read these quotes every five minutes This book was very similar to 'Animal Farm' except it used people instead of animals. I saw lots of similarites in the two books and how power can get into the wrong hands. Some people like to abuse their powers and these two books show that really well. I think people who like to read about government would like this book because it relates to how a country is ran. Willam Golding did a good job of using description in which he described every little detail whether it was a person the island or what the boys were doing. 'The Bushes crashed ahead of them. Boys flung themsleves wildly from the pig track and scrabbled in the creepersscreaming.' This is just one of the many quotes where William Golding uses vivid details. I have been trying to add more details to my stories ",3.0

" After more than half a century William Golding's first novel still has the power to chill the blood with its cautionary tale of the degeneration of a group of castaway schoolboys into the depths of animal savagery. However as a criticism of more optimistic boys' adventure stories as a critique of democracy or as anything much beyond a warning of the obvious that young children especially young boys must be carefully civilized (and continually re-civilized) it's a failure... because Mr. Golding cheats. Though Mr. Golding would no doubt claim (with justification) that boy's adventure authors tended to stack the deck in favor of their protagonists Mr. Golding does the opposite. His characters never had a chance. A comparison specifically with R. M. Ballantyne'sThe Coral Island referred to in the novel and generally with other boys' own adventures should suffice to prove the point.AGE",3.0
" This book is more of an insight into Mr. Golding's view of humanity than it is an insight into humanity itself. Needless to say Mr. Golding has a very negative view of people. Perhaps his view is colored by the fact that he lived through the development and dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan (atomic bombs are brought up in the book as having hit the airport from where the boy's plane departed) and the rise of Nazism in Germany. Mr. Golding uses a group of plane wreaked boys to tell his tale of what he thinks is the natural denigration of society. Still I can't find his view at all consistent with the world around us. If savagery was natural for people we would not have developed into a civilized society. In fact with few exceptions all peoples form structured societies that impart rules for the welfare of the group; not the other way around as Mr. Golding would have us believe. Except for few notable exceptions (like Nazi Germany) savagery is not natural for people. Even there civilized peoples prevailed. Additionally I believe this book has racist overtones in that Mr. Golding chooses to use the jungle motif to display his version of savagery. Why couldn't he use another back drop?Technically good writing gets the book three stars. ",3.0

" The 'Lord of the Flies' is an incredible journey that follows a group of boys stranded on an island after a plane crash. All the parents on the plane have died so this big group of boys has to fend for themselves. A big part of this story is about how the boys still create rules to govern the island. A leader comes around named Ralph who has continuous argumments with Jack the oldest who himelf wants to be in charge.Things start off well but sitings of a beast on the island scare many. One of the boys named Piggy a very intelligent but not liked boy has great ideas and tries to get everyone to listen to Ralph and do what he says. One thing Ralph is big on is keeping a rescue fire going. Jack makes a group of hunters to get meat and when their out hunting the fire goes out as a plane flew by but couldn't tell anyone was there because there was no smoke.Ralph and Jack get into a huge argument that ends up seperating the boys into a group of rebelious hunters lead by Jack and the other group with Piggy and Jack. Jack's group has all but Piggy and jack. Gruesome and odd ending chapters see the end of some as the hunters kill them. The leadership and rules set on this island fall apart and shows how rules can diminish is a second and things can turn ugly fast. This book was a very good one to read it had a an ending that leaves you thinking and a story that makes you think about your own life and a great story about these boys on an island who have to fend for themselves create rules and watch things diminish and change drastically after disagreements and a fight for power take place on this island. I reccomend this book to anyone who is looking fo a fun and interesting story to read that has a great ending that leaves you thinking about what's next. ",3.0
" Personally I didn't completely like Lord of the Flies but I still give it thumbs up for the outstanding plot. It began rather slow and dull and continued that way until about three- quarters of the way. I believed too much symbolism and much unnecessary high levels of vocabulary were used throughout Lord of the Flies. Considering this book is required to be read in the English classes of most high school students I believed it should have connected to us in a more straightforward manner as in contrast to a symbolic way as it did. Furthermore when I begin to read a novel I am usually brought in or attracted by the beginning of the book so I can keep interest in it. If I had not been required to read Lord of the Flies I would have almost certainly stopped to read it due to the lack of enticement and hooks in the novel.Towards the end of Lord of the Flies is where the book began to get interesting and truly began to hook me into reading more and even reading ahead of the class. Even though it gets good in the end if you look at it from another point of view things begin to get a bit out of perspective and maybe out of reality. That's when you must realize that these kids have been stranded on an island for an incredible amount of time and things can sometimes get out of control; you'll have to read the book to find out exactly what happens. Even though I didn't personally like Lord of the Flies I still believe every sophomore should be required to read it due to the great storyline and I also believe it is different from most novels but in a good way.

" Upon his return from World War II William Golding wrote the book Lord of the Flies demonstrating how the war had altered his view of humanity and the evil it was capable of. Borrowed extensively from R. M. Ballantyne's The Coral Island Lord of the Flies is set on an island that acts a microcosm of WWII. The school boys demonstrate what Golding believes will happen should man be unleashed into the wild with no society to monitor his actions what will happen when man gets in touch with the primitive evil inside him. Using supposedly innocent children to enact this tragedy Golding makes his message even more daunting and thought-evoking.In the midst of war a plane evacuating a group of school boys from Britain is shot down over a deserted island far off course. The story follows the boys' attempts to survive and to be rescued. It follows their process of electing a leader the battle between Ralph and Jack and the island's descent into chaos. This novel is pretty intense. The allegorical struggle between good and evil is suggested in the title of the novel. The title is said to be a reference to the Hebrew name Beelzebub (literally 'Lord of Flies') a name sometimes used as a synonym for Satan.The story which seems to be another survival story keeps its readers engaged with the tension contained in the calm yet eerie narration. The mystery laced yet seemingly uneventful opening of the novel immediately captures the attention of readers and holds them in a sort of frustrating suspense as they wonder about the meaning and significance behind the introduction. As the story develops and the island is enveloped in madness the reader wonders in horror at the savagery such young and supposedly innocent children are capable of. Without any sense of morality and other societal influences children are the perfect subjects in this examination of true human nature.The syntactical structure and the abundant imagery truly make Lord of the Flies a graphic and daunting read. Variations in syntax between long continuous lines and choppy rhythmic sentences help readers visualize and relate to the situation in the book. Be it the pounding nervousness as their camp is invaded by children gone wild or the frightening image of the 'lord of the flies' each scene is intensified by the author's mastery of language. It helps a reader further delve into Golding's microcosm of humanity as the boys' descent into savagery threatens our faith in the good of humanity.Despite the magnificence of its message and the remarkable skill with which this novel is crafted I definitely do not count Lord of the Flies as amongst one of my favorite books. I personally felt that Golding was far too pessimistic in his view of humanity. While the story does serve was a frightful caution sign it does not reflect the whole of humanity. Golding seems to have been greatly affected by his experience in WWII. It is true that war brings out the worst in people but it is also true that war and savagery do not define our existence. Perhaps I am simply far too optimistic but I feel that just as there is innate evil in the world so is there innate good. That is why the struggle between good and evil is a ever present theme in both literature and life.Lord of the Flies is a great read if its allegorical message is taken with caution. Its deeply developed characters add complexity to this mind shaking story. The suspenseful plot in addition to Golding's eerie narration makes Lord of the Flies a novel that will leave you shivering. All in all it is worth the read. That is unless you'd rather go for something less philosophical and more simplistic. ",3.0
" Although the story of the book was decent and the symbolism very complex I did not really agree with the message of the book and found its theme unrealistic. I don't think that the situation would collapse into anarchy but instead primitive government such as in the beginning of the book.The desires of the boys to 'just have fun' were very unrealistic and counter-intuitive. For example not one person outside of Ralph and Piggy truly care about getting off the island. No one misses their family and it is not even mentioned. There is no discussion of the boys' background except for the fact that they are English and nobody ever thinks about it. It is completely unrealistic to ignore the fact that in the real world the first priority of the boys would be to try and escape and go back to the civilized world.Secondly the overwhelming desire for meat which is supposed to symbolize the savagery in humans is highly exaggerated. The fruit on the island is plentiful and there are many resources. The boys never have any problem getting food and realistically would not engage in such frivolous hunting for meat.I also found the characterization extremely flat. The characters are just faceless names on the page outside of Raplh Piggy Jack and Simon. ",3.0
" First off I really want to state how dissapointed I am that I did not enjoy Lord of The Flies more. The concept is one of the best in the history of literature",3.0
" In this microcosmic society created by the mind of Golding things got too ridiculous too quick. First all the boys crash on this deserted island after being shot down by a bomber. Within a few days they burnt down half the island killing a boy and broke up into groups with a killing machine and a democratic leader. Needless to say they start by killing the weakest and last killing the smartest. The only problem with this is that they are only twelve year old boys who at the very least could have a civil war within a matter of days.I think Golding had a great point of what a society would do to itself and he showed the power children had which was in fact just a minor display in comparison to the great civil wars within our own countries. The only deal with this is that it wasn't very believable. Aside from that he perfectly displayed his point. He portrayed every character as a crucial member of society. You have Ralph who's the democratic leader believing in order Jack who was the dictator or person that believed in his own way Piggy the smart one who had all the right ideas and Simon who was the more spiritual one who rather would do his own thing and believed in helping others and looking out for the smaller weaker children. You could see this in each person and connect in some way because Golding always displayed them doing the very things you saw them out for. At any rate I would at least say read it. ",3.0
" The book 'Lord of the flies' starts out with a group of Brittish boys that are stranded on an uninhabited island. Things start out great and the boys assign eachother jobs and responcibilities. The leader of the tribe is a boy named Ralph. But soon the boys become to interested in hunting and Jack (another boy in the tribe) decides to start his own tribe. Ralph is ok with this move because he thinks that Jack will come back to the group soon. But Jack doesn't ever come back to the group and ends up killing Simon (a member of Ralph's group). Jack's tribe is becoming violent and very savage- like. When Ralph confronts Jack's group about restoring peace and finding ways to get off the island another member of Ralph's group gets killed (a boy named Piggy). Now Jack's group wants to get Ralph out of the picture and try to kill him but right before they are going to do him in a Navel officer comes onto the island and stops the madness.I belive that the theme of this novel is evilness in chidren. This is the main because it is stated throughout the entire story. Golding shows and belives that children are born with evil and society makes us nice and polite. Golding also symbolizes this concept in many ways. One of these major symbols is Jack. Jack is relitively nice at first but as the story progressives and more chaos and fear is developed he becomes more agressive and evil. Another symbol is Piggy. Piggy was the symbol of intellagence and knowledge. When he was killed it was Golding's way of saying that without rules and guildlines evil will always conquere good. After reading the book I could say that I realy enjoyed the book and it got me thinking about what life is realy about. ",3.0
" I find it difficult to fully express my opinions about this book which I finished last night. On the one hand it was extremely exciting and fast paced in its general plot and description and this made it fun to read. On the other hand it was full of dark ominous foreboding and at times downright terrifying symbolism. I am normally not a big fan of excessive symbolism and this book had more than I had ever encountered. This alone would not make me dislike a book though. I found myself genuinely loathing the savages and this while it drew me into the book also made me hate reading it. I coulnd't shake the feeling that something terrible was going to happen and when it did the feeling didn't go away. All things considered I certainly feel that this book is superbly written and does a wonderful job of conveying its message. However I coulnd't stand the fact that the message was basically that humans are inherently evil. I couldn't disagree more and while I may be labeled a deluded optimist I can't bring myself to believe that some schoolboys on a desert island would end up killing each other. I found the thought most disturbing and depressing and that was my overall impression of the book.All in all this was a wonderfully done book with a clearly conveyed message and I am glad that I read it. However I disagreed with the message and found the book to be quite disturbing. My review couln't be much more mixed up could it? I would suggest that you read this book but be prepared to be shocked and detested. ",3.0
" I read some of this book in high school but read it in its entirety recently to see how I felt about it as a 32-year-old adult. I enjoyed it somewhat.It is a good plot concept in general with lots of opportunity for analysis and psychological scrutiny. However oftentimes I had a difficult time believing that the characters were children because they seemed to behave a little too adult for their age. The writing was a bit verbose for my tastes although not excessively so. Because of this it didn't suck me into it's world entirely and it wasn't something that I was very enthusiastic about finishing except to find out how it ends.Overall this is worth reading if you have any curiosity about it but it may take some determination to get through it.

" This book falls into the category of books that claim that a few mental exercises can make Einsteins out of all of us that the Einsteins and Newtons of the world are not that much different than the rest of us. While I don't agree with this belief I do believe that mental ability can be improved through exercises and I found many of the exercises to be interesting and helpful. I had a problem with the author's demonstration of how these exercises can help the reader. In the introduction the author has the reader read a section of text and then she introduces a 'Brain Power Doubler' for the reader to use while reading a second section of text. The 'Brain Power Doubler' is supposed to allow the reader to read the second section of text in less time than the first section of text even though the two sections are supposed to have the same number of words. When I went back and checked the number of words in both sections I found several times as many words in the first section than in the second section which had more to do with the time differences than the exercise.

" This is a review of the STERLING/PEARSON DVD 'Bob Hope Film Collection' edition (with the green cover!) I hope that helps set this apart from the other editions and reviews...The film is a good example of the Road movies - it's no Utopia or Morocco but it's still very entertaining. Lamour is ravishing whilst Hope and Crosby wise-crack and soft-shoe with the best of 'em. All in all a four star movie.However this DVD has a rather pathetic amount of extras (ie. none) a fair-to-middling print and a very low audio track. My suggestion is to find another DVD edition. At the end of the day - we all want to upgrade from VHS to DVD so why settle for an edition that is estentially lower quality? ",3.0
" I have not used Dip It and I'm sure it works great but I used regular powdered dishwasher soap and it worked amazingly well. I have a Farberware 12-cup stainless steel percolator that the inside was all stained after 10 years of use. Could not get the stains out no matter how hard I scrubbed. And the stem basket basket lid and top lid were badly stained as well.I ran it through 2 perk cycles using 2 tablespoons (each time) of dishwash in the basket. The first time I filled it up to the 12 cup line with water and ran it with all the parts in place (stem basket basket lid top lid). When it was done the water was literally black from the stains it had removed and all the parts were spotless and the inside of the urn was spotless up to the 12 cup water line. The few inches above that were still slightly stained so I ran it a second time with the 2 tablespoons of dishwash this time filling the pot up completely with water to the very top of the urn with all the parts installed.

You see this '80s remake of the 1950-something [ahem] 'classic' is really just a ridiculous b-movie with fancy special effects.The plot is almost as absurd as the title following what appears to be a colossal alien jelly as it rampages through an American town munching on its inhabitants and generally being a bit of a nuisance. Cue face melting blood spurting and lots and lots of gore.The acting is as cheesy as everything else in the movie and the very idea of a psychotic blob murdering people is somewhat laughable but as i already mentioned this is an entertaining Saturday night horror film.

" Once upon a time in 1958 a little horror gem was made it was titled 'The Blob' now the this blob wasn't like any other blob oh no sir this blob was mean and liked to eat people with its nasty gelatin..Ok enough cute talk let's get to the movie.This remake of the original 50's classic makes the best effort to re-invent the story of a meteorite that carries a deadly alien life form...or so it seems. This time around we have Shawnee Smith as the lead protagonist (best known from Saw franchise) her role in this film is as great as it is in the saw movies she presents a typical teenager but with a little bit of attitude. Along are other forgotten 80's stars.I have to admit that the plot may be in certain ways similar to that of the original but the Chuck Russell (Director) brings new gimmicks and frights to what you may think can be your typical cheesy horror flick. I myself was surprised by some of the moments were I jumped in the movie. The effects are also impressive even though by today's standards they are outdated there are still are alot of impressive mechanical effects that are not seen much nowadays.Personally this is a rare remake that's superior to the original. It's almost up to par with David Cronenberg's The Fly. I personally would buy it its slick funny and of course slimy lol.MY PERSONAL RATING",3.0
" Not a big fan of 50's sci-fi but the original Blob freaked me out something good. This one just doesn't retain the freakishness or eerie dread of the original.

Christopher Lambert rides around on a horse and struts around in armor while some unknown terror stalks around the basement of a castle. The castle is surrounded by more men with armor and horses who don't want anyone to enter or leave it although they're only moderately successful.

" If you are a rabid fan of ye olde epic Beowulf and are dying to see it adapted to film then this is probably not for you. I recommend The 13th Warrior instead. Actually I recommend The 13th Warrior to any fan of medieval action or fantasy adventure. My endorsement of Beowulf doesn't go NEARLY as far and yet somehow in spite of its many glaring flaws I find this 'adaptation' quite entertaining.This straight-to-video year 2000 take on the ancient tale stars Christopher Lambert as the superhuman hero Beowulf except this isn't the Dark Ages. Instead the events take place in a post-apocalyptic future of gears and steaming pipes (a setting that I feel was a mistake). It has Hrothgar the 'Border Lord' Grendel and Grendel's mother but everything else from the poem is absent and here the similarities begin to wane. As movies go this is Fortress meets Mortal Kombat (both of which starred Lambert) meets Mad Max and thrown somewhere in the middle of this techno-gothic realm is Beowulf. Beowulf himself has become a high-flying martial artist (thanks to Lambert's stand-in naturally); Grendel's mother has become a sexy porn star succubus who seduces Hrothgar in his dreams; and Grendel is your typical B-movie creature with some purple haze surrounding him at all times to make the costume seem more imposing (and point of fact it does make the man in a monster suit beastie seem less like what it actually is).Not unlike the old fantasy flick The Sword and the Sorcerer Beowulf still manages to be fun in spite of its many failings and sometimes laughable production values (not to mention laughable acting). I still haven't managed to grasp how it can equal more than the sum of its parts but if you don't expect a film version of the old epic and instead expect a second-rate Lambert action flick you might have fun also.

" I have read most of shakespeare's works but this one I haven't yet. For this movie that can only be a pre. Anyone who even considers any link with the original writing will be appalled by this movie. But anyone with the intelligence to read Shakespeare would be able to see in advance that this one movie has indeed nothing to do with the literature and also would be able to open their mind enough.And if you do that there is a chance (especially if you are a not too stupid man with still too much testosterone in his blood) you may like it. The vision behind it is a erotic melting pot of weird gothic romance unintentionally funny acrobatic fighting diverse (funny) acting archievements and a lot more. Basicly I think it was the director's wet dream version of Beowulf and as that it is abolutely fantastic.The modern technology in a basicly gothic setting has its appeal definately. The bodybag is totally rediculous and so is the speaker. But the costumes are often very cool. Sell all your clicheed fake immitation Matrix outfits this is the way to go. I am still looking for the top of the princess to give to my girlfriend. But seriously the costumes were one of the few things worth watching.For the monsters the CGI department used some tricky ways to make what basicly looks bad have enough appeal although I agree that the monsters are probably the least scary element of the movie. The mother in the end looked very awkward expecting something like in Species this new body of the mother looks very unpractical to me but in some way sexy as is the most important element of this movie. The editing of the shots of here is terrible beyond believe but there was probably not very much to begin with anyway it is easy to see the whole new look of the mother was only done in CGI and for the real action they only used images of the face with some make up and a few props truly B-movie style...As an actor Christopher Lambert is theoreticly a good choice to portray the character in the story. However in reality his performance is not toitally the way we would expect. Moments of more than wooden acting intervened by moments where it looks like he couldn't manage to keep a straight face and stop having fun about where the hell he ended up as an actor are all over the movie.The sexual fantasies about a Shakespeare play cannot be complete with a a certain amount of sexy women. The Princess as I mentioned gets all of the attention by her already mentioned outfit but if you as a man find time to watch her face you may find moments of acting beyond what to expect from this movie. The monster's mother goes even way further actually she is almost a parody of herself here.So what we see here is a movie made with a vision no mather what kind of vision or whose vision a universe is created. Attempts to do something like that always receive recognition. I wish I could get a chance to turn one of men's literary masterpieces in an almost mindless [...] of style and vision with a slightly erotic flavour it must have been great fun for the crew to work on this.As a viewer you first should really consider what this is and hopefully this review helps on that. This kind of movie indeed deserves a few loyal followers (probably the people who also love Starship Troopers) and masses of people left hating. I myself will definately see this movie again some time not that I love it. But it is inspriational in an artistic way and just entertaining to watch. ",3.0

" A very different style to this version. If you ever saw Fellini movies you might compare them to something he did to the Roman stories. I kind of liked it and although cheesy as Robert Law indicated it's worth a rental or maybe even a purchase if you like different approaches to classic stories. Christopher Lambert looks pretty good still and he has one heck of a stuntman doing somersaults and other tricks to beef up the sword fight scenes. They all have some unusual weapons to add to the hundred plus bloody ways to kill someone in this movie. Did I mention the method used to take people's heads off looks like a giant straight razor? Yeah and the castle looks like a fire belching refinery on steroids or is it Ozzy Osborne's home on amphetamines? Is there a difference you ask? Anyway it's a hoot if are willing to be open minded because the costumes look like something they bought at a Cyndi Lauper garage sale.

Christopher Lambert has a tendency to pick offbeat roles (such as The Sicillian) but they are quite charming nonetheless.

This is obviously shown up on budget and special effects by the 2007 film of the same name yet for some reason I still like this one. It has a kind of campy gothic theme think David Lynch's Dune version. Go in with low expectations and you might enjoy it. ",3.0

There were some really great sounds coming from the band and I had hoped that they would continue on this album. What we hear from Sean on 'STEREOTYPE A' sounds like a b-side from his album...ok so we see his influence on their sound. Fine. But where is Cibo's influence on CIBO MATTO? It is definately a 'Sean' song...good but it just doesn't fit. It just adds to this mismash of production. The good news? They've maintained the kooky lyrics and instrumental variety.

Lint Of Love - 3/5This song is kind of R&B-like.; The lyrics seem to mean something but I can't tell what. This one doesn't really hold up.5.) Moonchild - 5/5This song has a very pretty instrumental and the lyrics are wonderful.6.) Sci-Fi Wasabi - 4/5This song is a rap song. I don't think the lyrics mean anything but it's a fun song.7.) Clouds - 5/5This song is one of my favorites. The lyrics are weird and almost unrelatable. However the way it is sung makes it a great song.8.) Speechless - 4/5This song is a rap/R&B-inspired; song. I like it but in some spots there are a few flaws. I particularly like the ending where everyone is singing together.9.) King Of Silence - 2/5This song is easily forgettable. The lyrics have a little meaning but it's carried out poorly in my opinion. This is probably my least favorite song on the album.10.) Blue Train - 3/5This is a 'rock' song. It is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be in my opinion but that's just me. It is catchy... Although it is pretty weird.11.) Sunday Part I - 2.5/5This is Cibo Matto's attempt at a normal rap song. It is very forgettable like 'King Of Silence'. I do like that it leads into the next track though.12.) Sunday Part II - 3/5This song has emotion but it isn't that great of a song. Don't be fooled with the 'Part II' it's nothing like the last track. They're just both about Sunday.13.) Stone - 4/5This song is a really good song. It is filled with emotions. The lyrics are short but they speak a lot in my opinion. One of the better songs on the song.14.) Mortming - 5/5I really like this piece for some reason. Most people probably don't. It is weird and in 4 'pieces'.

" this band has always confounded me a bit. they seem to be good musicians and Yuka Honda apparently is a big name around the new york scene but these Cibo Matto records just do not hold up over time. one of their biggest pitfalls is that they can't decide if they want to be serious or just take the piss and be silly. sure it's cool to do both but when you've got an absolutely stunningly great song on here like 'Stone' on the same album with the cringeworthy 'Lint of Love'...it's just not right. something's gotta give. are you a pop band or a novelty act? it's frustrating because their are some real moments of great pop genius here ( 'Moonchild' 'Sunday Part II') and then horrifying mistakes ( 'Sci-fi Wasabi' 'Blue Train'). well...take it how you want it i guess. it could have been so much more. this band has been gone for some time now but we'll always have 'Know Your Chicken.' heehee ",3.0
" Don't be misled by the other review on here that says this is 'mainstream R&B' and that the album is somehow consciously 'commercial.' Ridiculous. However I can understand the dissatisfied position that that reviewer was coming from. On first listen (which is all I have to go on) Stereotype A seems less exciting or creative than the first album. It sounds like the girls in Cibo Matto really enjoy playing with a full band but the results just aren't as remarkable as the more eclectic sampler-driven stuff on their first album. Practically every song has a laid-back lounge vibe reminiscent of Beck songs like New Pollution and beautiful singing -- which might grow on me but my first impression of this album is that it's well-crafted and 'mature' but sadly this seems to equal boring.

" For women with fuller busts this bra is great...but only for a little while. The company recently switched to metal clasps on all except the black to hold the straps because they were getting too many complaints about the plastic ones breaking...which happened to me at work. There really isn't a risk of the metal ones breaking but the straps have a tendency to slide through the clasps just after wearing it a few times.

" I purchased this bra during a few months in which I was temporarily off of birth control due to needing to renew but waiting for the insurance from the new job to kick in. I was experiencing extreme breast tenderness during ovulation and menstruation to the point that I would go to the bathroom at work and cut the wires out of my nice expensive bras. I decided to purchase a wireless bra for those days so that I could experience some semblance of comfort.When the bra arrived I tried it on and it fit. It supported fairly well. I love that the straps lock into place and don't slide longer as it's worn. However it bears a terrible resemblance to the bullet bras of my grandma's era which is not a look that I prefer. I also have terrible problems with wireless bras not giving me enough separation causing my breasts to touch sweat and chafe regardless of weather/climate control conditions however most of this can be solved by applying deodorant or baby powder. The strap padding is more annoying than effective as it slides around and constantly needs adjustment. If there were a way to hook or fasten it into place that would be ideal.I do like that there are four columns of hooks as the standard three tend to stretch out far to quickly for my taste leading to me taking in the sides or back of my bras - I prefer the bands tight for if I don't have ample support my back lets me know in very unpleasant terms. This bra however does not feel like it will be stretching out at any point in the near future as the fabric has very little elastic.This has been designated to be an at-home-only bra due to the shape and I doubt I'll ever wear it in public. I'm to the point of not caring about seams or trim showing through my top provided the bra does its job of making my boobs round lifted and front and center however this fails on all but lifted. It's perfect if I'm sick cleaning or lounging or if I'll be going somewhere that evening in constrictive undergarments but prefer to be comfortable until it's necessary to change.If the shaper were better I may consider purchasing this bra again however as it is I will not be purchasing another one as I have found an alternate comfy bra that doesn't mis-shape me terribly. Being that I'm now on Implanon I don't have to worry about ovulation OR periods however it's nice to take a break from wires and side boning on occasion. ",3.0
" I decided to try this bra based on my own research indicating it was one of the best wire-free bras available. I work at home and was looking for a less expensive option than my go-to bra (Elomi Energise). Although the Elila is expensive too the price here was reasonable so I decided to give it a try.The support is good. It definitely reminds me of bras that my grandma would wear with that odd pointy shape that it squashes your boobs into. However this is a wire-free bra so I knew that would be the case going into it. Since I was just getting it primarily to wear around the house I was not that concerned.I could not get past the itchy unpleasant feel of the fabric. I would have returned but I had already removed the tags and washed it since that usually helps to soften the fabric. I'm sure if I wore it more frequently it would soften but it felt like torture to me so I haven't been able to do that. However I am extremely sensitive to the feel of the fabric. I have Glamorise bras as well and while they are itchy to start out as well I think they are more comfortable in general (and a more reasonable price).But again the support was good. If you are looking for a wire-free bra that is very supportive and don't mind the shape that this gives you and are okay with breaking in the itchy firm fabric then I think you would be happy with this product. For me I will be investing in the Elomi Energise bra which does have a wire but is ridiculously comfortable flexes with me and has a nice smooth fabric that is not itchy. ",3.0

Us in the united states would most likely argue that our hip-hop in some instances is more about street cred. Where MC Skinner lacks in street cred he makes it up in the expletive heavy HARDEST WAY TO MAKE AN EASY LIVING which to its credit isn't a bad album. However after reading about the hype in a number of magazines and online articles the product was slightly disappointing.There are some genuine hits though they might not be mainstream hits of U.S. hip-hop. It is difficult to get past the fact that Skinner has a very heavy British accent. However tracks like 'Pranging Out' 'The Hardest Way To Make An Easy Living' 'Never Went To Church' and 'All Goes Out The Window' are very good. Even tracks that are more filler material feature exceptional production something that Skinner easily has above some of the producers in the U.S. The indie feel is something that more U.S. artist should explore.However there are missteps here. There are a few corny lines such as the 'cigarettes before matches line' in 'War of The Sexes' which all in all isn't bad. Also some of the songs come over as unrelatable and uninspired and grow rather boring. Even at its best occasionally the constantly looped production does grow a bit monotonous. What is important to understand here though is that Skinner is very different from U.S. hip hop and that is always a refreshment to see somebody who has a different twists on things. I was hoping this album would've been slightly better but I still liked the things that Skinner was doing. 3 stars. ",3.0
" A few years ago there was an explosion of sorts concerning British artists broadening rap like Dizzee Rascal and the Streets. I really couldn't get into it though; the thing that bothered me about Mike Skinner (yes people the Streets refers to ONE person) is that his material didn't sound like rap to me; it sounded more like spoken word. But he does sound more like a rapper on his latest offering The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living.But even though the production is on point the songs as a whole aren't that accessible. And I'm not saying that because Mike's thick accent can make things incomprehensible to the average listener (although there's some truth to that; 'War of the Sexes' anyone?); it's that most of the time I really don't understand what in the world he's talking about which is especially the case with the album's opener 'Prangin Out'.The few times where I COULD figure out what was going on I wasn't too impressed. 'Fake Streets Hats' has Mike complaining about supposedly pirated Streets merchandise (I say 'supposedly' because it turns out that Mike's label distributed the hats) and 'When You Wasn't Famous' is a been-there-done-that comparison of his private and public life. Speaking of that song when Mike and friends try to sing the chorus sometimes it's pretty nerve-racking (see 'Two Nations').I really think Mike could have done a better job than this; it almost feels like he just wanted to put SOMEthing out because now that Lady Sovereign is getting some mainstream love he's like 'Hey remember ME?' Let's hope he perfects his craft; maybe then it won't be so hard to make an easy living.Anthony Rupert ",3.0

" I couldn't find any relatively new information about this product running off of a Mac. Hopefully this'll be helpful to others. My machine is a Santa Rosa Intel 15' Macbook Pro running OSX 10.5 Leopard with 2 GB of memory.First off I'd like to point out that this is pretty much the same exact copy of Topic Entertainment's American Sign Language Deluxe as the other listings on Amazon. All of the copies are both Windows and Mac format all on the same discs.After copying the application to my local drive and running it I would get a series of repeating errors that would eventually lead to the application crashing. I sent in an email to Topic Entertainment's support group. Their response was that their title was only written with the intent of it only running on the system requirements printed on the box which is OSX 10.1 on a G4 and there were no plans to release an update for Leopard. They offered to return my copy for a refund if I wished.Not wanting to take no as an answer I fired up Windows XP SP2 through VMware Fusion and attempted to install the software. Worked like a charm videos are just as crisp as I'd expect them running natively on the Mac and disc swapping works correctly. There was an error during the installation about my copy of Quicktime being newer then the version required and asked me to first uninstall it before restarting the ASL Deluxe installation I clicked ok and the installation continued on as normal.I should also note that I've gone through and created ISO disc images of all eight discs through Windows and am storing them locally on my drive so I don't have to lug around all of the discs at once. This works fine VMware Fusion mounts ISO images without a problem.The software its self is a little clunky. The first disc offers some written words about ASL. What you're buying is on the rest of the discs a vast video library of others showing you words or phrases. I haven't played with it much past that there are some games I haven't touched.I'll update this review when I've had more of a chance to play with the software but for now I wanted to throw up the issues I had installing under 10.5.

" I bought ths terrific little saucepan at the beginning of 2009. It's supposed to have a lifetime warranty (hmmm my lifetime or its?) So far I've had 3 years of very happy cooking with it but the other day I noticed very tiny pock marks on the inside bottom of the pan. I am concerned this may mean deterioration. I've had way too many experiences with non-stick pans so when I purchased this one I also added the Kaiser KaiserFlex Silicone Cooking Spoon to my Amazon order. The only cooking utensils ever used in this or my other new pots and pans are all silicone. I absolutely loved this pan so much I bought the Anolon Advanced 3-1/2-Quart Covered Straining Saucepan a month later. That is strictly my pasta pan -- turns out perfect every time.

" He came into the wrestling business being put in the same spotlight as Andre The Giant & for over the next 15 years he's definitely been one of the most dominate giants in the history of the business. From being 'Andre's son' to the 'World's Largest Athlete' the story of Paul Wight is finally being told. Throughout the documentary you'll hear from his various family & friends along with fellow WWE talents such as William Regal Triple H Arn Anderson Chavo Guerrero Edge John Cena Pat Patterson.The documentary begins with the story of how he was a small town boy (complete with footage from when he was a kid) to have health problems early & a heavy eating habit. How he played basketball with that ending up getting him suspended for 6 months is talked about before going into the story behind the issues with a tumor that caused his overgrowth & stories behind the job he had before going into wrestling. The documentary continues talking about how he was discovered by Hulk Hogan & trained at the WCW Power Plant with Triple H & William Regal commenting on his experiences there before going into how he got the spot that he did resulting in winning the World Championship in his very first match. His ability to be very athletic for his size as far as speed coming off the top rope and doing moves likes dropkicks were heavily discussed before going into the problems he had in WCW with Triple H having his own theory of what went wrong there. The story behind Show's WWE debut at the St. Valentine's Day Massacre PPV was talked about next before going into how he was miserable in his early WWE career before talking about how certain veterans like Undertaker helped mentor him. A big highlight of the documentary happened next as the real life story behind the storyline with Big Boss Man in regards to his father's death was heavily discussed including why they had to take a more comedic approach as the storyline went along as opposed to keeping it serious. His first WWE Championship win the concept behind his entertaining impressions and his reasoning behind his time in the OVW developmental territory are discussed before talking about his dominance in the ring with such highlights as when him & Brock Lesnar broke the ring. We get a tour of his personal traveling bus along with the story behind why he got it & what he brought to the ECW brand was discussed before going into his new training methods that helped him lose weight & stay healthy with the feud with Floyd Mayweather (including getting his nose broken) & his acting roles (Knucklead Waterboy SNL) finish out the documentary.Matches Include",3.0
" I bought this trainer a few years ago and spend the winters riding about 7 hours per week on it. The noise level was GREAT for the first few years but it has recently gotten much louder and is almost impossible to hear any TV/DVD audio once riding it. My guess is that most trainers get louder after a lot of use but I'm looking to replace it after a few years of use due to the noise issue. ",3.0
" When I first started using the trainer I could not understand the comments made about the noise as right out of the box it is very quite and I could easily hear the TV music my kids etc. However I have now put about 30 hours and about 500 miles on it and it is LOUD. The wheel makes a loud clicking noise that progressively gets worse. When I watch the TV while I ride on the trainer the TV slowly gets turned up until my wife comes in and asks why the TV is so loud. I rated this 3 stars because it is average which is unfortunately what I expected. I did not want to spend the money on a fluid trainer so I got the Magneto based on reviews and recommendations. I do not regret buying this and I would do it again but I have been on cheaper trainers that are this loud as well. ",3.0
" This tape prove that Sills needs a microphone to be heard. I agree she has the most fabulous bel canto technique. But to hear her in person. Well let's just say you can't hear her too well.

It's on cd so you can hear her loud and clear. Her singing is awesome and so is Gedda. They hit some pretty high stuff in that opera. But fair warning...if you don't like Bellini you'll hate it.

" This trainer mostly does its job. My biggest complaints are that it is very noisy (which is annoying in an apartment building) and the resistance is not very strong (fine if you are going for an easy ride but not quite enough if you are trying to do high intensity intervals). My roommate has the Cyclops Mag which is both quieter and provides more resistance. For this reason I usually end up borrowing hers. The bar mounted shifter only makes very slight changes in the resistance. If I was buying the trainer again I'd save the $20 and buy theCycleOps Mag Indoor Bicycle Trainer ",3.0
" Trainer was easy to put together and looks sturdy. I can't comment on how well it works because I haven't been able to use it due to the one flaw I mention in the title of the review. Nowhere does it say that your bike needs to have a rear wheel with a quick release skewer to be able to use this trainer. It wasn't until I got to that part of the installation that I realized I would need to buy a new wheel to be able to use the skewer they provide that locks into the trainer. Maybe that's an obvious thing that I should have known about but I was unaware. I could use a new wheel so I'm not too upset about it but you should know about this before you decide to buy the trainer. ",3.0
" It is very simple to put together and mounting your bike is even easier. This would be perfect for a person looking for a light workout but it does not provide enough resistence for a serious bike rider. The tension adjustments are barely noticable.

" If a slightly Nashville Bob Dylan with Keith Richard licks sounds like it might be your kind of thing some of this will please. This journeyman musician writes like a dream in spots songs like 'Hot and Cold' 'Poor' 'I'm on to You' and 'Blow' have classic hooks that sound like they must have been popular songs a few decades ago for the Byrds in their country phase or someone like that.Not everything sounds that way 'Ready or Not' has kind of a sludgy Jethro Tull sound to it and it doesn't work very well besides. And regarding 'Death Trip' personally I'd just as soon not have an Aussie Neal Young bitching about us when his own vermin-riddled country is hardly virgin. Hmmph.

" Chald if I didn't see it I wouldn't have believed it. Goya drew a photo of someone lighting a lamp by flatuating on it! Today some call that 'fart lighting.' Whoa! It was a trip seeing something like that in a serious documentary.This work had many scholars providing interviews as opposed to just having only two. The narrator has poor Spanish pronunciation. He said 'Josefa' as if the E was a short English one. He said 'Cadiz' as if the last syllable was a short English I. The documentary is filled with grainy reenactments that some may not be able to see. I found the inclusion distracting.Like Beethoven and Edison Goya went deaf. Those interested in famous people with disabilities may want to read more about that. Perhaps it would make for a good paper in a disability studies class. I'm shocked to learn that Goya was targeted by the Inquisition because I would have assumed that body died approximately 100 years before his adulthood. The narrator contrasted how other countries were embracing the Enlightenment while Spain ignored it. This reminded me of how Franco spent myriad years ruling Spain at a time when other countries staunchly rejected Fascism.Most viewers know Goya for his formal non-controversial works. This documentary proved that he made dark and risqu'e paintings that could still be seen as shocking. ",3.0
" This Side of the Sky is a beautiful story of two life long friends Myraleen and Lilian who grew up in Nadir Mississippi and went on to see and experience the world. Sometimes tragic yet always poignant Ms. Singleton's novel is an enthralling read. The time period of this novel spans over 70 years- from the 1930s when the girls lived with the constant reminder that the color of their skin precluded them from reaching the highest heights to the year 2000 when color is a hue on one spectrum.It took a good 50 pages to draw me into the characters. Many times Myraleen and Lilian looked at the same situation from different perspectives. I found it amazing how captivating their friendship was. It endured a lifetime with hardly a disagreement or regret. Ms. Singleton's research made This Side of the Sky come to life. The historical accuracy of the plight of African American's during periods of social change in our country kept the characters fresh and my enthusiasm to read was intensified. The social aspects of their relationships with others made reading multidimensional. I even received an education learning that there was a far greater contingent of African Women who served as part of the Women's Auxiliary Corps in World War II than I imagined. Rising from seemingly hopeless childhoods to become well-rounded well-traveled well-versed ladies who enjoyed their lives This Side of the Sky drew me in and kept me until the end. ",3.0

" Before you spend $250 on what at first glance might appear to be a new edition of Oppenheim be aware that this is reprint of the 3rd edition (the last one written by Oppenheim himself) which came out in the first part of the 20th century (can't remember the exact date; after 1912 but before 1940). This is NOT a new edition.The most recent edition is the 9th of Part 1 only edited by Sir Robert Jennings and Sir Arthur Watts in 1992.

" Faces (John Cassavettes 1968)I have to rank myself among those having seen Faces who understand its importance in the film world but can't bring themselves to like the movie. I understand why Cassavettes did the things he did with this movie why the film is supersaturated and the sound mix is awful and all the other little quirks that kept this so far away from Hollywood and its subject matter is conceptually brilliant; the question one has to put to oneself is whether you're actually going to be able to sit through two hours plus of what is essentially boring and obnoxious cocktail-party banter even after the cocktail party itself is long over.The main characters in Faces are a married couple Richard and Maria Forst (John Marley and Lynn Carlin) who have found their marriage going stale and in response each flirts with the idea of finding a younger lover. The results of their dalliances however are anything but the pleasant no-strings-attached sex each was hoping for; in fact the consequences are potentially disastrous.It's a great idea and I do like the way it's carried off most of the time. Technically it's a brilliant approach to the subject; Cassavettes gives us washed-out characters in a washed-out film bending every aspect of the moviemaking process to the psyches of the people he's got in front of the camera. And the script works right along with that premise; if you have washed-out characters in a washed-out film what other sort of dialogue should they have saved washed out? Unfortunately however this has always been my problem with 'The Dead' that short story of James Joyce's that everyone but me seems to love. My take on it is that Joyce was subscribing to the hypothesis 'if you want to write a story about boring people write a boring story'. And the story certainly succeeds beyond any reasonable bounds in that regard which I assume is why so many people like it. Similarly Faces; Cassavettes has done a fantastic job of it here though substituting 'washed-out' (I can't imagine anyone calling these folks 'boring'). And it's a deft and proficient depiction of the characters. It's the characters themselves that get on my nerves. *** ",3.0
" The trademark of John Cassavetes films is emotions laid bare. You might call this an emotion strip tease without the tease. This film is no exception. However it is not as focused as his later Woman Under the Influence or Opening Night. Some scenes loose their effectiveness by their length. A tighter editing would have worked wonders. Nevertheless the film has a strong emotional impact a harbinger of his later films and arresting structural innovations; well worth watching. ",3.0
" Watch the lives of a group of list-sisters unfold through a series of messages between them and their families and through two email loops. While the primary email loop is called the SAHM I AM loop and moderated by the self righteous Rosalyn there is a secondary one Green Eggs and Ham in which the more disgruntled members diss Ros and her toady Connie. Through the months covered crises frequently pop up; marital woes adoption and fertility issues child rearing catastrophes past mistakes that need to be paid for in the present and health issues that may not be life threatening but are heart breaking. Rosalyn's life is not as trouble free and June Cleaverish as she pretends on the loop and her facade could collapse if her sister is allowed to join the group because Ronnie knows the truth that Ros is not a Proverbs 31 ideal woman.*** While there is no one main plot a series of subplots threads together. Though this lack of coherence is a definite drawback the characters are so true to life that there is something endearing about this novel. Anyone who has been on a loop with a troll will be doing their best bobble head impression nodding along with the on target descriptions of the reactions of the Green Eggs group to the bad aspects of the SAHM one. Yet there is also the very positive light that is shone on how supportive and true email friends can be. *** ",3.0

" This is an amusing if slightly odd story. I guess that Ruskin considered himself such an intellectual jack of all trades that he'd a have a go at the genre if only to say he'd done it.The story is built from familiar parts. There's a Cinderella theme built around a young boy and his two cruel brothers. There's also a theme of the wandering stranger who after being treated well or poorly rewards the doer equally well or poorly. In fact that was such a cool idea that Ruskin threw in two magical beings quite independent of each other making the front and back halves of this little creature look like thay came from two different animals.It's a pleasant enough fairy tale but not one that I'd spend a lot of time hunting down.//wiredweirdPS",3.0
" In this book Petroski brings up a few good points. Engineering is human. Engineers as oppose to what some think are not perfect. They are not able to create a perfect design for the given problem. They create what they believe is the best solution for the given design specifications. They along with others test their solution in theory. The majority of these solutions are created and succeed perfectly. Although most of these designs are successful some are not.It seems to be most of the failures of designs happen when it deals with something big including the Kansas City Hyatt Regency Hotel walkways which killed over 100 people or the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. These failures become famous and the engineers are the first ones to be looked at.Along with engineering success comes failure. This is a part of being human. Human engineering will always have its failures along with its successes. When engineers build something they analyze it to determine if their solution is the best solution. Sometimes it takes a failure for the engineers to see their failures and to correct the problem. This book tries to explain this and does in most cases. In some of the cases it leaves the reader wondering what else could have been done or what needs to be done in the future to prevent these failures. ",3.0

" 'Operation Condor' is similar in style to 'Rush Hour' or 'Mr. Nice Guy'. These are examples of Chan`s later movies in which he tries to burst through to America by breaking free from his Hong Kong roots. The production values are far glossier than his earlier movies - this one is shot on location in the Phillipines Spain and Morroco. In the film Chan and three female friends (one Japanese one Chinese one German) journey into the desert to find hidden gold - and get into comic scrapes. Sadly the version I saw featured appallingly sloppy dubbing into English which made it feel as if the film was produced in the U.S not Hong Kong. In a bizarre way this works to Chan`s advantage. He works well with the supporting cast generally fooling around and displaying a fine line in comic timing and Buster Keaton style slapstick which is very entertaining. A good fun film. Don`t expect a kung-fu classic like 'Fist Of Fury' because you won`t get it. But remember Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee are different. Chan was trained to entertain his audience and this film will entertain all who see it. ",3.0
" Jackie Chan is a physical genius and thistogether with a sense of comedy and an air of winning self-deprecationhelp set his movies apart from those of other action stars such as the wooden Van Damme and the pompous dirigible Seagal.The physical skills are well in evidence here as are the comedy traits -although personally I find them less well showcased this time aroundOperation Condor is clearly an expensive movie and makes widespread use of well photographed North African and European locations in its tale of Chan and some female colleagues hunting abandoned Nazi gold in the face of opposition from Arab terrorists and one of the gold's former owners.There are draggy bits in the middle when the story gets bogged down in broad comedic interludes and the dubbing throughout is execrable.All is forgiven when it comes to the climax -an elongated fight scene in a wind tunnel that has flair pace and panache.The end credits show the injury sustained by Chan in making the movie when a stunt went wrong-proof that here is an action star who does not stint on placing himself on the line .Four stars for Chan -and marked down only for the dubbing and the misfiring comedy scenes which simply dont travel well to Occidental audiences ",3.0

" What you can learn from reading other reviews! As my wife sat and watched this movie I kept thinking that the big explosion at the end reminded me of another movie..the far superior LONG KISS GOODNIGHT. And now that I have read the other reviews I see where they used footage from CLIFFHANGER and NARROW MARGIN. Hmmm...studios will go to extreme lengths to make movies huh?As far as the rest of the movie goes Treat Williams is all but lost in a small role as the CIA special agent with the warped sense of humor. Most of the focus is given to the budding romance of John Beck and Susan Blakeley survivors of the ridiculously staged plane crash. Add Bongo the Bear and a subdued Steve Franken and there's even more foolishness. Not to mention the other survivors who go off on their own; one dies from unknown causes; the stupid wildlife t.v. star (hah) shows her stupidity by firing a gun and causing an avalance that wipes out everyone except the two lovebirds who have just reconciled. We also have a crooked pilot a diabetic man and his daughter and oh yes a Tessla device that uses brainwaves to cause nuclear destruction.Why the three stars? The scenery is beautiful; I found myself interested in spite of myself and some of the performances were enjoyable particularly Ms. Blakeley's alcoholic writer. But the big 'character development' scenes only served to slow down the movie's overall pacing. But considering the theft from other movies one can only laugh and say gee whiz!!! ",3.0
" For and 'original work' how could the producers and director hope to get away with the 'Cliffhanger' 'Narrow Margin' and 'A Long Kiss Goodnight' cut and paste scenes.

My son about fell out of his chair as we watched the plane and helicopter sequences the chases and train sequenses the semi truck sequences and climactic explosion that we had seen from other movies. He wanted to know if those actors got royalties off of this movie especially Craig Berko who was clearly seen but not credited.That aside there were many cliche moments some good lines and some very bad dialog. But it was worth watching especially with someone who does not know (or even one who does but hasn't yet seen it) about the cut and paste because it makes for a hilarious (absolutely unintended by the makers I'm sure) movie experience and a great conversation after the movie among friends.

" Jerry Stahl seems to be able to find the sarcastic and sardonic humor in even the most downtrodden lives. 'I Fatty' is a firsthand account of Fatty Arbuckle's tumultuous life. It's written very simply and helps us to imagine the inner turmoil of being an outsider in a judgemental society.Born to an abusive father in Kansas Arbuckle turned to theatre as an escape from a bitter life. He rose to fame in the cinema and at one point was more popular than Chaplin. He was the first screen actor to make a million dollars a year.But in 1921 he was accused of the rape and murder of actress Virginia Rappe. He was slandered by the press and not even his acquittal could save his career. He eventually lost everything.Stahl emphasizes the mental anguish of being fat impotent and presumed guilty. He also shows the role that heroin played in Fatty Arbuckle's life. Heroin was readily available and legal at the time and he became addicted using it as a pain killer after a botched medical procedure. Towards the end of his years his servant used heroine as a tool to get Arbuckle to divulge all of his secrets.I had the pleasure of hearing Stahl read from the book and it was quite entertaining. He joked that it is obligatory for him to include heroin in every one of his novels. He emphasizes the public outcry against Fatty as being led by a conservative anti-Hollywood element. I would agree but would also like to point out that in the 1920s journalists had more leeway to embelish the truth and print it as fact. Even today the press chooses to emphasize some facts over others and often slanders people in the process.If you are interested in the life of one of Hollywood's first stars and if you like dark humor 'I Fatty' is for you. It's a good read that will make you think and give you a laugh or two. ",3.0
" Roscoe Arbuckle was a fat man who lived a tragic life. He was born in Kansas to an abusive father and invalid mother. The father taunted him for his considerable girth while beating him with a strap. Roscoe ran away after a year or so of grammer school to hit the boards in vaudeville.Underneath the all too too sullied flesh there was a good brain and warm heart. Fatty became famous as a star comedian along with opium addicted Mabel Normand in the Keystone Cop flicks. Fatty knew them all-Chaplin Keaton and Lloyd. He was the first Hollywood star to make a million dollars a year and was loved by the vast American public who enjoyed a night at the flickers.Along the way he engaged in many bad habits such as heroin and opium usage excessive eating and drinking enough to drown several grown men. He was known as 'The Prince of Whales.' Arbuckle was always well dressed knew his lines and was eager to help newcomers in the business.Fatty's life went down the spout when he was accused of the rape and murder of the floozy Virginia Rappe in a St. Francis Hotel Room in San Francisco. Fatty endured three trials and terrible publicity. He was finally acquitted but his career was in shambles. He went on to direct a few movies under an assumed name and opened a nightclub but the damage had been done to his career. Fatty married three times endured several physical afflictions and was the first big star whose scandal gave Hollywood a bad reputation in middle America.Jerry Stahl has done his research on the Arbuckle life and career. Arbuckle (1887-1933) was an important figure in early film comedy who deserves to be studied. ",3.0
" Let me begin by stressing that Jerry Stahl is by all means a good writer. I FATTY is an enjoyable read in some ways; but also a distressful one particularly to fans of silent film comedian Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle. Johnny Depp is quoted as describing the novel as 'the true skinny' on the comedian. With all due respect to this very talented actor I am somewhat puzzled by his statement. Having read the novel twice I found the Roscoe of Stahl's novel to be pretty much a bitter rudely-spoken and generally depressing incarnation which is hardly synonymous with how Roscoe's friends and associates remembered him. Though I cannot be certain of course it seems to me that Stahl's main motive for writing this novel stems from a fascination in a life which certainly was plagued by much pain and injustice. Roscoe had a very sad childhood left alone to his violent alcoholic father after his mother's early death and constantly teased at school for his overweight; and while he admirably managed to outwin much of the traumas of his early years going on to become one of the most celebrated film comedians of his time his career was ruined after he was wrongly accused of rape and manslaughter in 1921. Roscoe played the sidekick of Charlie Chaplin early on in the latter's film career and was the one who directly introduced Buster Keaton to the world of celluloid.A fascinating subject for a novel no doubt. However the fact that all persons directly involved in Roscoe's life have in all probability deceased by now should not mean that ehtical deference can be ignored altogether. The events described does not require that far a dive into the past after all; the scandal which ruined Roscoe's life happened less than a hundred years ago. In my opinion Stahl far too seldom seems to take into consideration that his characters are based on real human beings. Perhaps this is a matter of necessity from an author's point of view; in order to make a character come alive on the page focus on plain facts may indeed be a hindrance. A character based solely on facts and authentic observations would possibly turn out too realistic to be believable in the context of a novel. Yet what troubles me most with I FATTY is that it recalls Roscoe's entire story seemingly first-hand from his perspective and I'm not convinced that the book's admission of being a 'novel' on the cover will prevent people less acquainted with Arbuckle's life to interpret too much of this as the truth or close to it (Charles Nordhoff and James N. Hall's novel 'Mutiny on the Bounty' and its arguably inaccurate portrayal of Captain Bligh comes to mind).A few distressing examples",3.0
" Some of this book may be true. Jerry Stahl has thoughtfully included an impressive bibliography for us to mull over.But a lot of this is known to be untrue. So I had to drop a couple of stars off what otherwise is a pretty readable biography of Roscoe. He didn't like the sobriquet 'Fatty' you know.Stahl has a breezy pitter-patter style that keeps you turning pages even though it wears thin occasionally.But the real problem I have with the book is it seems apparent to me he just doesn't like Arbuckle very much. He gives the misfortune of the great fat man too much credence as if Roscoe deserved what he got.In the mid 70s I was in Hollywood trying to break into acting. For amusement my girlfriend and I chased down infamous old Tinsel Town addresses as we boned up on the angst their former owners had experienced. Arbuckle's house on West Adams is still there but by then no one believed any of the stories about Roscoe's 'parties'. He had become a tragic figure an example of Moviedom overreaction to what should have been page 6 minor news.I respect Stahl for researching and writing this book. I just wish he'd stuck closer to the truth. ",3.0
" It's not a bad book really. It just drags a bit. I never felt like I was in the head of Fatty Arbuckle telling his story. I felt instead like I was reading someone trying a bit too hard to speak like him. It comes off as stilted and after a while makes the book a chore.There's an interesting story here especially since the subject matter is so tragic. The man was railroaded and ruined because of it. His fall from grace was an awful thing and you really feel for the guy when you learn about his story.Unfortunately this isn't the best telling of that story. He doesn't even make the character that likable and gets some of the historical facts completely wrong.Stahl is a great writer so I wanted something better than this. It's slow and frankly just not that interesting. ",3.0
" The concept of I Fatty is a good one--a novel written as if it is the autobiography a controversial historical figure.

Some parts of the book just did not feel like first person narratives. ",3.0
" This review pertains to the 2004 Collector's Edition DVD transfer and likely the 4-movie DVD bundle too.Tremors is a great movie and always a guilty pleasure.

" The film Tremors is as good as ever - campy funny silly and lots of fun. However this HD-DVD transfer is not worthy of the medium.

Kevin Bacon Fred Ward and Reba McEntire head up a cast that's about as one-dimensional as it gets flaunting their stereotypes with enthusiasm in the midst of an utterly ridiculous set of circumstances. The premise behind the monsters is original and the effects actually look pretty solid considering their age but the concept is pushed to such extremes that there's nothing to do but laugh at the sheer ballsy idiocy of it all.

" After being unable to obtain this from an online store during the Christmas season I finally found this exceptional video yesterday at an offline store. It is another program in the brilliant 'Bell Telephone Hour' series which ran on NBC-TV for nine years during the 1950's and '60's after being a radio program for many more years.For a filmed television program that was made thirty-four years ago this long unseen documentary is in remarkably good condition. It is a beautifully photographed (in color) documentary-concert which combines a tour of the Prado Museum in Spain with musical performances by such great Spanish classical artists as guitarist Andres Segovia pianist Alicia de Larrocha and operatic soprano Victoria de los Angeles as well as a flamenco dance troupe. Although Mr. Segovia's narration is stiff self-conscious (we notice that he looks off to the side at the teleprompter) conductor Donald Voorhees's share of the narration is eloquently spoken.However although the narration is informative nobody really watches a program like this just for information-- although presented like this it never becomes boring. We are treated to breathtaking closeups of the paintings of Velasquez El Greco and Goya and part of the excellence of this program is that unlike other museum tours on video this one manages to avoid sounding like a dry lecture.There is another dimension to this video perhaps the most important and this unfortunately is where it falls short. Apparently the producers were so eager to inform us about the paintings that they decided to give the music rather short shrift. Almost without exception every time Segovia or Larrocha launch into a classical piece (and their performances are naturally brilliant) more narration intrudes into the program and the music is reduced to mere background accompaniment. And Segovia's performance of Albeniz's unforgettable 'Leyenda' one of the most famous pieces ever written for classical guitar is abridged! Only at the end of the program do the makers of this film seem to come to their senses when Segovia formally announces that Victoria de los Angeles is about to sing and she is allowed to perform her aria with no interruption or commentary.This offhand carelessness about musical content is NOT typical of the 'Bell Telephone Hour'. In such past programs as 'First Ladies of the Opera' 'A Trip to Christmas' (yes that is the correct title) and others the music always came first. We could have been just as well served if the filmmakers had concentrated on showing us the paintings and displaying their titles onscreen while letting us hear the performances. Perhaps that would have made it less of a documentary but who cares when you can hear music like this performed by these musicians? ",3.0

" There's a great 1994 Lars Von Trier movie (with a 1997 sequel) largely not available in the US dealing with a ghost child haunting a hospital called The Kingdom in Denmark. This hospital was built over old bleaching pools (rather than a textile mill) responsible for the death of this child and others (continual exposure to chlorine gas). In the film one of the main characters is an older psychic lady who continually feigns illness to be admitted to the hospital to investigate the haunting. Responding to a ghostly child's cry she gathers other patients and hospital workers together for seances as part of her investigation. Coincidence? This Diary of Eleanor Druse is a work of fiction as noted in the wee letters on the cover and is obviously based on King's reworking of the earlier movie if not written by King himself under a pseudonym changing the location to his usual Maine settings. Heaven knows who the Eleanor Druse that reads the book on tape is. Von Trier's movie (which may have originally been a TV series in itself it's never been clear) is a quirky and sometimes very creepy piece of work. Highly recommended to anyone that doesn't mind a four-hour film in Danish crossing ER with Twin Peaks. I'd be very surprised if the US television remake will be anywhere as atmospheric or original.

I'm much older and I'm reviewing a Stephen King novel here.Unfortunately I didn't enjoy this one very much. The language seemed awkward and clumsy almost as if SK was trying too hard to 'sound like' Eleanor somebody-else.The plot just didn't draw me in the way some of King's best work has.

What King done was produce the Mini Series Rose Red which was based on Pearson's fine novel. But it would not suprise me if King hatched the ideas of both these books in his brilliant mind.

" I enjoyed the insights of this book. Many of these issues have been addressed before in other books. One of the best in my opinion is the Naked Capitalist. That book has a more in the way of references to support these types of theories. It also has more objectivity. My problem with the book is that the author approaches the subject with an almost intolerant Christian perspective. Everything else is pretty much viewed as evil. You find yourself interested in the subject matter but having to screen out the Christian right mentality of the author to get anything out of it. This makes the work a provocative but an unenjoyable read. ",3.0
" This book is wickedly entertaining and seems to make a lot of sense although giving a few months of time to think about the material made me realize that it was little more than good entertainment. Conspiracy theories are good fun and can make you snap out of boredom and skirt the boundary of paranoia which is a testament to how dull our lives can be. This book may have you looking at everyone you see in a funny way for a while but in the end it should be viewed as mere entertainment. Some of this junk may be true and there are abundant cross references to the material but this guy's whole mission of sending an alarm seems to be just a vice for his own self-aggrandizement. Good fun but there is better material on this subject out there. ",3.0

The book concentrated on Freemasonry though later touched on the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) and its 'secret agenda'.

The music and lyrics aren't in the same league as subsequent works by Webber and Tim Rice.That said I did enjoy this production. Donny Osmond turns in a great performance in the lead role. The costumes and sets while garish are in keeping with the tone set by Rice's tongue-in-cheek lyrics. If you like DTS you'll be happy to know this DVD contains both DTS 5.1 and DD 5.1 soundtracks.

" I am glad I read the review posted here before I decided to just give my daughter the tape. I watched the video first. I refer to the scene between Joseph and Mrs. Potiphar. There is another scene in the movie that I consider 'costume' racy. This is not a family film. My children would know that this is not the norm. The female costume attire that was in the Mrs. Potiphar scene and the other; quite revolting. Strategically placed glitter on nude fabric or pasties on nude material. The scene itself was provocative and lasted longer than just a few quick seconds... This to me spoiled an otherwise fabulous movie. Wonderful vocals costuming was great - otherwise acting was great not many props but those used were good. Also on the video as mentioned on the DVD reviews Joan is displayed with an all black dress on the back cover. This is not the case in her scene as anyone who watches will see. Maybe I should have given this movie four stars but I was disappointed to see a 'family film' with costuming and a provocative scene such as this. At this point I do not yet know that I will give it to my daughter for Christmas. I have older children and they will pick up on the ... innuendo. Though I was quite taken with the video overall I don't know that it will hold the attention of a five year old for that long. I liked the way the film gave a modern interpretation to a classic Bible story. Also the 'trailer' into the video is long and has a racy video advertisement... ",3.0

" I don't think any one ever tried to pass off _Joeseph_ as a really great show. It is light superficial entertainment that an entire family can enjoy and there's nothing wrong with that. However when a production of such a show is as ludicrous as this one there is a problem. First there is the Assembly within a show concept. Throughught the movie There are these little pericriol school children who get up and clap after big production numbers as if to say to us the viewers",3.0
" Many of the costumes in this production are bodysuits designed to make it look like the actors are nude except for bits of strategic glitter. If it were rated this video would garner a PG. This will not be objectionable to most people but this video is being marketed as a 'show for the whole family' and if you are a conservative parent you may not want your kids watching it. For a good laugh pick up the video box in your local video store and look at the picture of Joan Collins on the back. Her costume (which normally makes her look like she's topless) has been carefully colored in on the top!That warning aside it's a fairly good video. I did not care for the way the show was framed as a production at a school and the children's chorus was actually annoying in spots. However most of the excitement and fun of the stage production comes through and Donny Osmond is fabulous as Joseph. ",3.0

" This delightful little piece was created for a boys' school many years ago. It is a humorous re-telling of the Old Testament story of Joseph and his brothers who sell him into slavery in Egypt. Because it is both funny and heart-warming it has been in production ever since. Joseph offers many varieties of music from a Country/Western howdown ('One More Angel in Heaven') to a French Apache-dance lament ('Zose Canaan Days...') and a howlingly funny 'Grovel Grovel' when the brothers are literally brought to their knees. Watch it! ",3.0
" In my opinion the most apt description of this video is the one amazon.com has given it above.Bright colorful playful musical and even a bit zany JOSEPH comes to technicolor life in this one of a kind show. It seems though that audiences will love it or hate it. I guess I fall somewhere in between.While the performers take a tiny bit of getting used to especially for those familiar with the show once you get the idea that this is a show within a show within a movie then you are halfway there. You have to watch it with a sense of fun and joy. It reminded me of 'Joseph' as performed by the cast of 'Willy Wonka' thrown into the set of 'Brazil' with a dash of 'Sillyville' and 'Las Vegas Glitz'. This is not a serious treatment of the material but rather a comical one (or one with tongue placed firmly in cheek). View it that way and you will have a ball.The sets are phenomenal especially the giant Pharoah head and the magical 'cartoon' desert. I can't believe I was laughing so hard so many times as I know the material so well and was consistently surprised by the manner in which it was portrayed.As for the suggestive costumes they last merely seconds on the screen and concerned parents (see posts below) should learn how to program their parental controls on their DVD players. Other parents would realize that little kids won't even notice what the big deal is all about (They will probably simply cover their eyes if they react at all!). Kids see worse on MTV!As for irreverance I would bet more kids would be likely to crack open a bible after watching this than those who had never heard of it.As a big fan of Webber and Rice I am glad that this video has finally been made even if I would have liked to have seen it done differently. Take it lightly and you will have an 'amazing' time. ",3.0

" I absolutely love both the Canadian cast and the Broadway cast soundtracks so I was excited to see this production. I wish I could say that I was excited to HAVE seen it but it was just okay. Donny Osmond does a great job...he's the best thing in here. I know Maria Friedberg is an up and coming name in musical theatre but I was extremely disappointed in her performance. Her voice doesn't have the strength of the leads on the cast recordings and she mugged her way through a lot of the numbers which would work on stage where everything needs to be exaggerated but doesn't work here. (To be fair most of the cast does the same.) It was a little distracting that the singing on some of the numbers was not syncronized with the actors' lip movements. It's better than nothing though and everytime Donny Osmond takes center stage you forget the flaws. ",3.0
" Let me start by stating this is perrenial favorite of mine. I've attended several productions of this from Tuacahn to high school productions. My daughters drove me nuts playing the soundtrack. I finally broke down and bought the DVD.Let me also state that we have high Christian standards. This did not meet those standards. My wife and I both flinched several times while viewing this version.Some of the costume are very risque' and some of the behaviors are very inappropriate. The Potipahr's wife scene was just short of brazen nudity and overly sexual.The narrator was not up to the caliber of other performances I've seen and Richard Attenborough did a mediocre job as Jacob. Donny Osmond played Joseph well and continues to deliver the level of vocal performance he was known for in the 70's.I liked the sets and the creativity although a 'for film' version would have been nice.The sound was poor. We had to adjust it several times during our viewing especially in the beginning.Minus one star for inappropriate material. Minus one star for poor sound.

" After reading all of the glowing reviews I couldn't wait to watch the series. Unfortunately it was a little disappointing. Visually it is stunning and offers a broad view of the vast continent. The problem is in the narration. Ugh! While viewing some of the most exciting scenery in the world and gaining some insight into the many cultures of Africa the narrator seems determined to put the viewer to sleep. And rather than give the viewer a real taste of the local music whenever someone bursts into song whether in a children's game or at a funeral they have chosen to pipe in some over-produced studio version of 'African' music that is full of western influences. Indiginous African music is so beautiful in its rawest form; don't insult your audience by assuming that we can't appreciate music that hasn't been cleaned up and westernized. ",3.0

" Every militant who wants to fight for socialism or put the fight for socialism back on the front burner needs to come to terms with the legacy of Vladimir Lenin and his impact on 20th century revolutionary thought. Every radical who believes that society can be changed by just a few adjustments needs to address this question as well in order to understand the limits of such a position. Thus it is necessary for any politically literate person of this new generation to go through the arguments both politically and organizationally associated with Lenin's name. Before delving into his works a review of his life and times would help to orient those unfamiliar with the period. Obviously the best way to do this is read one of the many biographies about him. There is not dearth of such biographies although they overwhelmingly tend to be hostile. But so be it. For those who prefer a quick snapshot view of his life this documentary although much much too simply is an adequate sketch of the highlights of his life.The film goes through his early childhood the key role that the execution of older brother for an assassination attempt on the Czar played in driving him to revolution his early involvement in the revolutionary socialist movement his imprisonments and internal and external exiles his role in the 1905 Revolution his role in the 1917 Revolution his consolidation of power and his untimely death in 1924. An added feature as usual in these kinds of films is the use of `talking heads' who periodically explain what it all meant. I would caution those who are unfamiliar with the history of the anti-Bolshevik movement that three of the commentators Adam Ulam Richard Daniels and Robert Conquest were `stars' of that movement at the height of the anti-Soviet Cold War. I would also add that nothing presented in this biography despite the alleged additional materials available with the `opening' of the Soviet files has not been familiar for a long time. ",3.0

" This is a much needed well written and finely translated defense of metaphysics in the light of Heideggerian and postmodern criticism. However it fails ultimately because of some bad choices in terminology light scholarship and a narrow understanding of metaphysics. The author doesn't quote any work by anyone written in the last 30 years and focuses only on a few lines of Heidegger ignoring some clear statements by Heidegger that would have resolved issues that trouble Sacchi. Not only that but a more careful reading of Heidegger would show that his views are not as radically opposed to metaphysics as Sacchi understands it. Sacchi rejects the metaphysycs of 'pagans' like the pre-Socratics and while it would seem he represents Scholasticism he will further claim that medieval Scholasticism is decadent. What we are left with is Aquinas's metaphysics alone perhaps some Aristotle by extension. Not a word on whether Plato's ontology is to be rejected as well.What is most frustrating about this book is how the word 'being' is used. The ontological difference is clear and simple. There are beings and there is Being. Sacchi transforms this into 'being and Sein'. One has to read then the word 'being' as 'beings' most of the time I think. For Sacchi Sein is a fabrication of Heidegger's mind and a replacement for god. So there are beings (being in Sacchi's terminology) and god. Fine. He also speaks of 'being as such' and it is unclear if this means beings as such or something else. Then he introduces the act/process of entification which he later terms the act of being. Presumably one is to read this as 'act of beings'. The problem is that Sacchi assignes as the source of this act sometimes beings and sometimes something else (god?). Beings the act of being and that which is by virtue of itself and nothing else all relate by participation-- reminding us of that pagan Plato. While I don't know Aquinas as well as Heidegger or ancient Greeks Aquinas does not seem as complex as Sacchi makes him to be. Heidegger's phenomenology would be a great resource the think about this curious and almost Platonic in-between",3.0

But I think she did a marvelous job at showing the differences between the generations and how exposure to new ideas cultures and technology can quickly change the traditions of a culture; sometimes the change is good and beneficial sometimes it's detrimental.

" We were comparing this unit to an older very similar model X-Acto we have. It is faster (the motor is stronger) and quieter than the older similar model we bought a couple of years ago. The point that is put on the pencils exposes slightly more wood which is good if you tend to hold the pencil by the exposed wood. It also has a nice amount of heft to it that means you don't have to hold it while you are sharpening--it will stay in place even as you push pencils in.However the cup is really disappointing. It is shallow and makes a mess when it is pulled out. We had filled the cup with shavings after only sharpening about 10 pencils. Also the accumulated static electricity made the wood shavings jump around and get on everything. So while the motor is heavy duty and the point it makes is pretty good the cup for the shavings is way too shallow for a 'heavy duty' machine. I contrast it to the Stanley Bostitch EPS12HC SuperPro 6 which has a cup at least 10 times the size of this X-Acto.However the Bostich doesn't put as nice a point on pencils. So if you are sharpening only a very small amount then the emptying of the cup won't be as big an issue for you and there is a good chance you'll like the point this machine makes. ",3.0

Honestly for a product priced and positioned as a Premium Sharpener the size of the shavings cup is somewhat laughable.The X-ACTO Teacher Pro (1675) sharpener I have had vastly superior results with it features a large cup and costs less.Unless I received a bad unit I just can't recommend this over other sharpeners.

" If you are looking for a biography of Queen Elizabeth II don't bother with this book which is little more than rambling reminiscences of some of the Queen's experiences. Poorly written - one jumps from one topic to another without any sense of continuity and there are annoying grammatical flaws - the book focuses rather narrowly on the author's experiences as a journalist covering certain royal tours. Rather shockingly she also uses unwarranted and inappropriately derogatory adjectives to describe certain people. Anecdotes are fun the photos are nice but this book could have been much better.

" GABRIEL'S BLOCKBUSTER ALBUM.RUINED BY MEDIOCRE SOUND QUALITY KNOCKING A FIVE STAR CLASSIC DOWN TO THREE STARS. DO NOT BUY THE ORIGINAL BUT GET THE REMASTERED VERSION INSTEAD.Released in 1986 this was Gabriel's blockbuster album. And it deserved it. This is just great from beginning to end. It features great collaborations with Kate Bush and Laurie Anderson.Unfortunately coming out in 1986 the CD sound quality was mediocre. This was very suprising for Gabriel who had embraced digital technology years earlier. The sound is flat with limited dynamic range.Many of the early CD's had mediocre sound quality which gave rise to the vinyl snobs who thought CD's could never sound as good as LP's. But it was just a bad translation to the digital technoology. Today CD's sound much better than they did 20 years ago. Which is why you see so many 'remaatered' CD's today. That includes the complete Gabriel catalog.Not only being the most popular Gabriel CD it is his best. That is saying a lot since he has had many very good CD's. ",3.0
" After flirting with commercial success through his first several albums and having several modest hits Peter Gabriel finally broke into the commercial consciousness.'Security' began to open up the fears and paranoias on 'Peter Gabriel 3'-- yeah it had some of that but it emphasized the world elements and introduced a somber reflective side to the dense dark music on '3'. And it also introduced a funky modern sound. 'So' is really the reconciliation of all of these elements. Once again supported by guitarist David Rhodes bassist Tony Levin and drummer Jerry Marrotta (Larry Fast is sadly not to be found on this record) Gabriel augments his old team with drummer Manu Katche and guitarist/producer Daniel Lanois and several guests including violinist L. Shankar drummer Stewart Copeland (of the Police) singers Youssou N'Dour Kate Bush and Laurie Anderson bassist Bill Laswell and guitarist Nile Rodgers.The album's opener really displays the new styles here at its best-- 'Red Rain' is a ballad but it moves its got an undercurrent of funkiness to it similarly 'Don't Give Up' (featuring a duet with Kate Bush) again as a ballad (and a dark one) is bass driven with a funk undercurrent and gospel bridge. These two are absolutely stunning and unique in music even to this day. While 'Mercy Street' is a bit more traditional in its structure it is another incredible ballad with a stunning vocal harmony arrangement in the chorus.The funk elements come out stronger in a couple other (and more famous) album tracks 'Sledgehammer' and 'Big Time'. Modern synth-driven in many ways with incredible bass courtesy of Tony Levin these two are monsters that arrived on the scene at a perfect time. My only complaint is that they like the largely straightahead pop of 'That Voice Again' are a drift both lyrically and musically from what Gabriel excels at-- taking pain darkness other elements of people's lives and making them internal and personal. Look at 'Don't Give Up'-- it sounds like he wrote it about himself but its about a Depression photograph. These are great songs but they're a bit too clean and pop for my tastes.'We Do What We're Told' and 'This is the Picture' move closer in the direction of 'Security' or '3' but seem a bit unnatural given the synth layering on them.Of course its the album closer thats the most famous 'In Your Eyes' is really the strongest demonstration of Gabriel's world music influences on this one its really a quite nice song admittedly it was played into the ground for a long time. Nonethless years later I've been able to enjoy it.Its a decent album. Gabriel's done better but this might be the best place to start. However for new fans I'd caution listening closely to the darker material like 'Mercy Street' and 'Don't Give Up' and see how that suits you its really more in line with Gabriel's other work than the pop songs are.

" This is the album where the dam burst open and Gabriel became a bona fide arena level superstar. Prior to the release of 'So' Gabriel had a solid loyal cult following of old Genesis heads and fans of his more sparse solo materiel. 'So' burst on the scene with the smash single 'Sledgehammer' and Gabriel's career was off to the races. A lot of people love this album and think it is the high point of Gabriel's career. For me it is the continuation of a downhill slide that would culminate in his next disappointing release 'Us' a few years later. 'So' is not a bad album but I don't think it is a great album either. Gabriel's timing just happened to be perfect as he exploited the use of the music video to promote the singles son this disc. Gabriel was a true pioneer in this regard and his videos for 'Sledgehammer' 'Big Time' and 'Don't Give Up' were truly groundbreaking for their time. It is just too bad that the actual songs were not as good as the videos were. Ok maybe I am being too harsh as these songs are all ok but compared to the deeper more thought provoking material of his earlier career much of this could be seen as fluff. The album does contain some great tracks however including the opener 'Red Rain' the brooding 'Mercy Street' and the closing love song 'In Your Eyes' which will forever be associated with the famous scene from the movie 'Say Anything'. 'So' is far from Peter Gabriel's best work but it is not his worst either. I would rate it around 3.5 stars as I find it a rather mixed bag. ",3.0
" This feature does have good qualities. The casting is spot on the cinematography great the character development good. It has the 'feel' of a good western epic.

Worse one of the story lines is wrapped up far too quickly despite the extensive build up it was given. The other story line conclusion is far more satisfactory but the wait seems interminable.In short this story could have been done on just one of the dvds.

Why they didn't program the firmware to work pulling those same formats off of the flash drive I have no idea but it is the main reason for the average rating.

" If you own Watermark Shepherd Moons The Memory of Trees or A Day Without Rain you already own this album.

" I was curious about Enya when I first heard of her; due to my love to U2's music and knowing that Enya became Irland's second biggest musical export after U2 (she's from Irland such a bad stereotype on my part).There's no way one's can deny her beautiful voice and remarkable style but I came to think that all her music has the same redundant theme when it comes to lyrics or music.This album reached the top 10 in both the UK and the US peaked at number 3 in Germany won the Grammy award for best new age album for 2007 and I'm in disbelief and trying to understand what is so special about this album.The reason I'm giving it three stars is that she is a hard working artist with glorious presence on the stage(at least she's not winking at the audience and acting cheesy like il Divo boys). With the inimitable style she has maybe it is expected to have a theme in all her albums but the lyrics of this album don't measure up to the standards she had in her other albums and they are either too repetitive and empty or just beyond my mental capacity. I'll go with the first choice; the lyrics are repetitive and empty. ",3.0
" I felt the words 'caged bird' were appropriate for the title of my review simply for the fact that I believe that Enya is a caged bird. Her creativity has been caged by monotony and the inability to try something new.If you want a sure and time-tested formula this is the album for you. Enya really does not re-invent the wheel. For a fan of her musicianship I think she is sadly held back by Nicky and Roma Ryan. She needs to assert herself more and find new songwriters. Amarantine? What the heck? Poor word choice and the song is sickenly dull. Amarantine the word doesn't even sound pretty. It doesn't feel right in a song either. Amarantine sounds like it should have belonged on Memory of Trees. Somebody Said Goodbye sounds like it could belong on Memory of Trees.The two best songs on the album are The River Sings and Water Shows the Hidden Heart. She sounds her best. The River Sings also helps to cut through the dull slo-mo of songs. They sound so similiar and run into each other. I also would like to say I hated Sumiregusa. I know this probably an ode to her Japanese fans. However her layered singing drowns out the beauty of the words.If you don't mind a lack of change and are an Enya fan I am sure you would love this album.If you haven't heard much of Enya's material and have never bought any of her CDs I recommend you stick to her first three albums - Celts Watermark and Shepherds Moon. They are her best work.She needs a new songwriter for starters. She also needs to experiment with instruments more. Her samples are getting old.I hate to be harsh but I am just not happy with her artistic offerings this time around. She has so much more potential.Finally I give her three stars simply for the fact that her voice is beautiful and her albums are always well produced. Beyond that this album really is a two. ",3.0
" Amarantine unlike all of Enya's previous work sadly underwhelmed me. It is a good listen but with a few exceptions I didn't feel I was hearing anything new. Enya's albums all have a distinct `sound' to them that which identifies them from the other albums. Not Amarantine.The good first. There are some great songs on Amarantine. 'It's in the Rain' the haunting 'Drifting' (the album's only instrumental) the furious 'The River Sings' the anthemic 'Less than a Pearl'... Amarantine has its winners. There's even the haiku-like 'Sumiregusa' entirely in Japanese which is a pleasant grower.However there are also some tracks which sound fairly it must be said unspectacular. 'A Moment Lost' and 'Amid the Falling Snow' are both such dull and uncreative tracks that I'm surprised that Enya put them on the album at all. Even the filler songs of The Memory of Trees were wonderful. That's the other thing what about the creativity in the instrumentation? You can really hear in each Enya album just judging from the sound what album it is. Not so with Amarantine. It lacks that special sound identifiable with itself. As good as the aforementioned tracks are Amarantine lacks that 'wow' factor which her other albums sport. Normally Enya's music transports you tugging at your heartstrings and mesmerizing you. I missed that feeling immensely when listening to Amarantine and it's a real shame.Another problem is one that lyricist Roma Ryan is responsible for. Three tracks are in the fictional language Loxian created by Roma herself. In the booklet each of these songs has the lyrics in Loxian as well as the English translation which is a welcome addition. However Loxian while beautiful to the ears has an alphabet completely unrelated to the Latin alphabet making following these songs lyrically impossible which is quite off-putting. There are also no songs in Enya's native Irish which is rather sad. Irish might have made some songs sound a bit more interesting.For those of you wanting more elaboration I will go deeper into each individual track.LESS THAN A PEARLA breahttaking composition with a moody and yet gloriously inspiring atmosphere. The chorus of vocals in the Loxian language weave a haunting layer of sound. A very strong way to open the album; definitely one of the best tracks.AMARANTINEThis is the first time the album's title track is not the opener and perhaps it was for the best here. 'Amarantine' is very plain and 'safe'. And the lovey-dovy lyrics just sound unimaginative on Roma Ryan's part. A sadly prophetic taste for what's to come.IT'S IN THE RAINThis is one track I am taken with; understated and low-key but steady. The melody is strong and gripping. A moody introspective track that has its own way of gripping the listener.IF I COULD BE WHERE YOU AREThis song's beauty is its simplicity - it's all vocal and strings and is a haunting thing in its own right. It reminds me of some of Enya's b-sides like 'I May Not Awaken' only more hopeful and stirring.THE RIVER SINGSThe first track I was truly taken with - an energetic fast and feisty song with a gorgeous thunderous sound. It's especially a pity here that you can't really follow the Loxian lyrics because it's another of the strongest tracks on the album.LONG LONG JOURNEYNot one of the album's worst songs but it's to thank its charm and catchiness that it gets away with its painfully unimaginative sound.SUMIREGUSAAnother winner slow and dripping with atmosphere. The haiku-like lyrics in Japanese are very moving.SOMEONE SAID GOODBYEMaybe it's just because of the pure melancholy of this song but I've never been able to really warm up to it. It divides people but I think it's one of the best English-language tracks on the album in that it weaves a mood so far removed from what one might potentially expect from Enya's work. I see some of Enya's emotion seep through here.A MOMENT LOSTSpeaking of things you can expect this song is so plain and unimaginative that it borders on plain boring. It doesn't even sound fully composed. Waste of disc space a dire song.DRIFTINGNow we're talking. Perhaps my biggest personal favourite; a gorgeous pristine instrumental (which this album could definitely use more of). The cello running through helps make this melody downright goosebump-inducing. This is magic and proves once again that Enya doesn't need lyrics if the music is strong in its own right.AMID THE FALLING SNOWThis song took me a long time to warm up to. If anything it has a great chorus and the final thirty seconds are very appealing. But the lyrics don't tell me anything really and the melody is fairly dire in retrospect.WATER SHOWS THE HIDDEN HEARTFor a closer this is a fairly anticlimatic song in the sense that for such a lyric-central melody you can't follow the lyrics in question. And the melody while nice and soothing isn't strong enough to be a closer. While this is a moving song it has to be the weakest closer to any of Enya's albums.Amarantine is certainly Enya's poorest release but it still has it good songs to speak of. The principle flaw as I see it is the sing-songy element in a lot of the songs; I miss the powerful melodies that were above that. As it stands we've heard it all before and portrayed much stronger than here. The artwork ironically illustrates the album perfectly; a whole lot of dull whites with some delicious reds thrown in. And Winter Came... would see Enya return to form but Amarantine is strictly for Enya's most devoted fans. ",3.0
" The reason for the three stars is there is nothing new on this CD. They should have titled it Greatest Hits of Enya and been done with it. I'm not saying the songs are terrible; I'm just saying I already have all the music on prior CD's. Buy it if you are a first time person listening to Enya. ",3.0
" I first heard 'Orinoco Flow' in a department store at the tender age of twelve and have been bewitched ever since by the sheer magic of Enya's music. I can think of no singer I admire or love more and with the possible exception of Loreena McKennitt no one whose music can touch so many different emotions. So I was thrilled when 'Amarantine' was released and popped it into my CD player the first chance I got expecting to be bewitched again. And it truly saddens me to say that I wasn't.Don't get me wrong - it's not a bad CD. I would still rather listen to 'Amarantine' than Hilary Duff any day. But given the choice between 'Amarantine' and 'A Day Without Rain' there's no question that my choice would be the latter. The truth is 'Amarantine' feels like a rehash of 'A Day Without Rain' and not a very inspired one either. The parallels are easy to draw. 'It's in the Rain' is 'Wild Child' 'Long Long Journey' is 'On My Way Home' (okay not on 'A Day Without Rain' but that's what it sounds like) 'Amarantine' is 'Flora's Secret' and 'Someone Said Goodbye' is 'One By One.' And with the partial exception of a few tracks ('Someone Said Goodbye' and 'Less Than a Pearl' for example) they all lack that unnameable quality that can tug at your heart like nothing else.Granted it is interesting to compare the parallel songs. 'Someone Said Goodbye' stands out particularly because it takes the exact opposite stance from 'One By One.' Where that song's refrain was 'Don't say goodbye' this one asks 'Is there a reason why you never want to say goodbye?' It helps that of all the album's songs 'Someone Said Goodbye' sounds the most like Enya inspired Enya at her best. Too many of the other songs suffer from either not-very-compelling music or lyrics far more pedestrian than we're used to hearing that pull the music down. I love Enya for her ethereal music her entrancing voice and lyrics like those in 'Only Time' - lyrics that mean something. Words like 'I wonder how you can endure/All I've said all I say to you' sound out-of-place on an Enya CD. Let me say it again",3.0
" I have been long awaiting this new album and was very happy to see that Enya had come out with a new album but when I put it on to listen I was a little bit disappointed in what I heard. As always there is some beautiful tracks. My favorite being track #3 but some of the songs are just dull and sound all alike. As always Nicky Ryan's lyrics are beautiful but many are very contrived and pop like. The album is missing the warmth that the Celts or Shepard Moons or even A Day With Out Rain had. It is missing that beautiful dreamy celtic sound that was once there. In some ways it seems that Enya has sold out to the more mainstream pop market which disappointments me a bit since I orginally turned to Enya to escape this kind of sound. Instead of buying this album I would recommend downloading some select songs from itunes and buying The Celts or Shepard Moons instead. ",3.0
" I hate to say this but Enya has run out of things to say. Even to the point that Roma Ryan has made up a fictional language to burble about. 'Amarantine' is something you've heard before and often. Even if it takes Enya five years between albums you get the vague impression that this was what you just listened to.Darn shame that. The billowing clouds of multi-Enya's singing like a blissed out choir were what made her great. There was no-one else out there that made songs anything like 'Orinoco Flow' or 'Storms In Africa.' But we're talking almost 20 years ago and 'Amarantine' just sounds like warmed over material. The songs all waft and drift and instead of inspiring bliss...they just vanish. Only the generic ballad 'Someone Said Goodbye' sounds like it could transcend the album we're listening to because this all just runs into itself like cotton candy fluff for aging new-agers.Maybe it was too much to expect that Enya and her collaborators could maintain brilliance forever. But like sonic architect Enigma (or even going back to The Alan Parsons Project) eventually the striking original becomes the banal. Unfortunately that is what we have with 'Amarantine.' ",3.0
" At age 16 I purchased 'Watermark'. I was in 10th grade it was February 1989 and the type of music Enya was making was very different from everything else at the time. I saw the video for 'Orinoco Flow' on VH1 and was sold (as were my friends). Well I'm 33 now and cynical and jaded (as I was at 16 too). Enya doesn't fool me anymore. I might as well listen to 'Watermark' and 'Shepherd Moons' as listen to 'Amarantine' Enya's sixth studio album. They're all pretty much interchangeable. The only reason her last album 'A Day Without Rain' sold over 6 million copies was due to a strange coincidence of 9/11 and a remix of 'Only Time' a version that wasn't even on that album. I hated the remix and I thought how cliche that the American public while in mourning and shock would turn to 'Only Time' of all songs (after all 'A Day Without Rain' had been out for almost a year with no notice).So 'Amarantine' like all of Enya's other works is soothing and pure escapist new age music. As with all of her albums it's pick and choose amongst the songs. I thought the title track 'Long Long Journey' 'Sumiregusa' and 'Someone Said Goodbye' could all be included on a new Enya best of compilation (which I could make since I own all of her albums). To listen to 'Amarantine' all the way through its 45 minute length is truly no different than listening to her other albums.I like Enya but I am artistically disappointed by her stubborness to NOT try anything new musically. She uses the same songwriters and producers for each album and makes one new release every five years (the real reason for this must be because she wouldn't sell the same model of car every year consumers would get suspicious!) In this way she hoodwinks the public because every five years the general public has forgotten who she is and therefore there is a new flock of sheep who have never heard of her to buy her music.How many more years will Enya continue to recycle her past work? She's a multi-millionaire now why not try something completely different? What has she got to lose at this point? My three star rating mean average folks. It's okay but nothing new or great. I'll be here in another five years to say the same thing (you can still read my post five years ago about her last album 'A Day Without Rain'!) ",3.0
" After listening to the samply of this CD I must agree with others Reviewer this CD is a disappointment.The lyric is not as good as before and too many repeated. Although the music is new but it need more to make me want to buy the CD.Enya is one of the best artist I know but are we buying her reputation or just the music itself? I am not buying anything just because of someone's reputation I pay my money for what I like. And this album is just not my cup of tea. ",3.0

" As a long time Enya fan (starting with the ground breaking album Watermark) I found Amarantine to be a let down as there is nothing new here that has not been heard before on her previous albums. In Amaratine it appears that Enya has finally run out of new concepts. After a long break from her last album I was anxiously looking forward to new material along the lines of Shepard Moons or The Memory of Trees. Watch out for what you wish for as that is what we got. This in no way diminishes the work Enya has produced to date as I still enjoy her previous albums I simply wish that Amarantine had continued the tradition of unique surprises. ",3.0
" I've collected everything worth having of Enya's even a lot of her singles (that means selections with a lot of duplication which renders having ALL of her work not worth the money) and decided I had to have this album as soon as I saw it was coming out.Unusually for Enya you don't get any Latin or Gaelic on this CD you get three Loxian tunes (I think I've read that this made up language has some Lord of the Rings Inspiration) and one in Japanese (Sumiregusa). I think that the overall tone of the CD is somewhat slower than past efforts it's more of a backgrond music album to my way of thinking because of this.It might not be the album for a new Enya listener to start with but established fans will find a lot to like here. I don't consider it to be Enya's best but Amarantine is much better than most CD's out there it is worth owning. I only hope she doesn't wait 5 years for the next one. ",3.0
" it's enya therefore it can't be below 3 stars... but it just doesn't excite me except for 'sumiregusa' 'the river sings' and the opening track. those three are BEAUTIFUL. the rest is slightly different than what she's done before in that it's average-sounding. it's like music for people in their late 50's rather than dreamy music for everyone. ADWR was dreamy but boring. this is just boring. i can't get into this one but i still don't hate it. maybe time will change my opinion... ",3.0

" I'm listening to a song now from the album in the hope that it will inspire me to write kinder things about the album Amarantine by Enja.This is new age which means 'voice layering synthesized backdrops and reverberations' according to Wikipedia which probably serves the same purpose of sunglasses--to hide many sins. A voice without range can go on forever. Nevertheless the melodies are soothing especially in a beautifully decorated main room with a roaring fire in a Vermont Bed & Breakfast. The sound can be captivating even if the words seem like Neil Diamond songs with no rhyme or reason. I find the melody especially of the feature song to be pleasing. It's great to listen to by a roaring fire but in my apartment that would mean the bookshelf or the curtains were going up in which case I would be in definite need of soothing. The words on the other hand can almost put me in a bad mood with their lack of message and repetition once twice three times a",3.0
" Thanks to a national catastrophe that is 9.11 Enya's A Day Without Rain soared on the charts selling some 7 million copies with some clever mixing of Only Time which saw sentimental Americans embracing the song giving her her first ever American Top 10 hit.Now some 4 years later Enya returns with Armarantine which fans have been waiting for with bated breath. The result? Amarantine is brief and typical Enya but the fact is that most tracks suffer from the fate of being rather indistinctly slow and unmemorable. And it has finally come to show that Enya's formula might already be wearing too thin for its own good.However all is not lost. The sublime and uplifting The River Sings is good reason why we still hold faith in Enya giving us something spirited. And there is Sumiregusa the Japanese haiku-inspired track used in a Panasonic ad that drove fans to a frenzy speculating her new album would be out soon last year. Having said that the track is beautifully serene and placid. The instrumental Drifting is befitting as part of a score for some major motion picture due to its lushness.Amarantine isn't going any where near Shepherd Moons or any of her previous albums but it'd still give Enya a decent run anyway. Not bad for a woman who sold 50 million records by shielding away from any limelight and putting out records at her own whim and fancy. ",3.0
" I have all Enya's albums but this one is simply not as good as any of her previous ones. ",3.0
" I have been a fan of Enya since I was 14. Ever since then I got hooked to her music and even Clannad's. I find that Amarantine is very mild by her standard. There is something to do with the order of her songs. The first song 'Less than a pearl' gets off on a good start. Unfortunately the hit song 'Amarantine' is second in line and it just ruins your appetite for every songs right after that. My recommendation would be put your CD player on RANDOM. It feels much better to listen to few other good songs before you finally reached 'Amarantine'.When you purchase this album you will enjoy the authenticity in Enya's voice. You know nobody can sing it like her and that's exactly what you are paying for. Amarantine lacks the effect of giving you goosebumps and that's very hard to come by when we are talking about Enya. But it does reduce the craving for the past five years since Days Without Rain. This CD will make a great stocking stuffer and that's only because the recipient will appreciate that he/she doesn't have to pay money for it. ",3.0
" Well I've heard both sides of the story here about this album. Some say it's horrible and predictable and others say that it's really great. I personally think that it's in the middle. It's not horrible because they're using the old Enya sound still - which is a really good sound but they're not really progressing much in any direction. It reminds me of alot of other bands that come up with a good sound but don't want to venture out of it. Why? Well in this case - I think it's because they don't have any ideas as to where to go. And well now looking at the sales chart for this why would someone want to make the effort when instead you can put out stuff like your older material and hit #1 on sales charts? Although it's really sad to see Enya have to take 5 years to produce this because I really doubt that all 5 years were spent writing this...it's just not that groundbreaking. Now if they had come out with something really different - but still Enya - then I could see the 5 years but it's really annoying to wait for that large amount of time just to see new material be alot like 'A Day Without Rain.'In any case - I can say that this album will please devoted Enya followers or if you're new to Enya but liked ADWR....but if you're someone like me who doesn't enjoy purchasing the same album twice - I'd recommend just buying her older stuff if you don't have it already and enjoying that. Or if you want a few new moderately good songs from Enya just download them off of itunes because since hearing this album from a friend - I came to the conclusion that if I had bought that album I would feel a bit ripped off and as if I could have just spent 3 or 4 dollars on itunes downloading the few standout songs.In conclusion - this is not groundbreaking or a standout album but rather - it's just average and will probably get boring the next time that I listen to it.

" I purchased this album on the day it was released. I was absolutely thrilled as it had been several years since 'A Day Without Rain' and I was eager to sample the fresh material of 'Amarantine.' Sadly I was disappointed. I only listened to the album once or twice before tucking it in my car's CD holder and not touching it. Very recently I decided to pull it out and give it a second chance with my newly-lowered expectations.The one thing that I dislike most about this album is that there's nothing that makes it distinguishable from other Enya albums. In the past all of Enya's albums have had their own distinct themes (ex. the melancholy moods of 'Shepherd Moons' the glorious exotic vibrance of 'The Memory of Trees'). With 'Amarantine' there is nothing distinct. At best it's a collection of dewey-eyed love songs and sounds mostly like a bunch of b-sides filler tracks and throwaway cuts from previous albums. Heck even the album artwork is boring and ordinary something I'd never expected from Enya.One thing I've discovered is that it is mainly the older fans who dislike this album. I would probably be considered an 'older fan.' I have all of Enya's albums including the fabulous 'Only Time' boxed set and yet this is the first album to really disappoint me. The disappointment lies not so much in the music but in the lyrics which are absolutely dreadful. One comes to expect lush storytelling and thoughtful meditations from Enya's lyrics... but with 'Amarantine' the listener is left with shallow immature romantical notions and constant repititions. One can only use the words 'heart' 'tears' and 'love' so many times before they become nails-on-chalkboard cringeworthy.Here are my thoughts on each individual track",3.0
" I never thought I would ever find myself using the term 'Disheartening' to describe Enya's work. I have been a near obsessed fan for as many years as I am old just about. I have all ofher imports her box-sets her VHS and DVD's... and unlike any other artist who decides to make we wait between 5-8 painstaking years for something new- I always found it was worth the wait.Until Amarantine. I cannot even begin to express my extreme disappointment in this Album. It's apparentfrom reading other reviews I am not alone in this. I don't want people to forget that Enya actually consists of three people... Enya herself the vocalist and instrumentalist Nicky Ryan the producer and Roma Ryan the poet and lyracist.It should be apparent to everyone that the problem with this latest work is *not* Enya herself. If anything her voice is the heavenly powerhouse it always has been andher English has improved tremendously. No longer should we Enya fans have to translate for our friends who sit stumped over the words. The words that Roma Ryan weaves still conjur up majestic images and longing emotions that spin tales leaving us breathless. She is a lyrical genius. The problem is Nicky Ryan who seems no longer capable of challenging Enya herself musically. In fact with Amarantine we here her in various themes influenced by their previous outing 'A Day WIthout Rain' specifically threads of their worldwide smash 'Only Time.' Perhaps Nicky was hoping to mimic that success unfortunately it fell entirely short of even modest Enya fans.What wrong with this Album? Thetracks seem simply exploitive of Rnya herself. They could be crap and we'd still purchase it. 'Long Long Journey' is far to reminiscent of a child's tune like London Bridge Is Falling down... with the traditional Enya-esque Ooh's and Ahh's thrown in for continuity. 'It's In The Rain' has lovely lyrics (Typical of Roma) but he theme to which it's set diminishes it's potential beyond redemption. Of course you will hear threads of their first outing 'The Celts.''Sumiregusa' a japanese inspired song was released actually last summer and used in a panasonic commercial. While it's etheral quality and overall beauty got fans all over the globe excited about the forthcoming album it was overwhelmingly sad to see it included on the album for one would presume with over 5 years between the last album and this one more tracks could have been completed and ready for inclusion. 'Sumiregusa' and the reaction to it must have made them think we would have liked to have heard it on the album instead of as a single- which was even made available on Enya's website long before the release.'Amarantine' isnot without it's small gems though. The two best tracks on this Album are 'Someone Said Good-Bye' and 'Water shows the Hidden Heart' both of whish sshowcase Enya's vocal capability and Roma's lyrical savvy. Aside from that nothing on this album will have you singing along nothing echoes the Enya quality to which we have grown accustomed to and finally nothing is remotely as memorable as any of the track on her previous albums.Perhaps the most frustrating fact is while most of us die-hard fans accept the extraordinary amount of time between albums (So much time that most other musicians complete 2 or 3 albums.) but what is hard to accept that after the sour reception of this stinker we'll have to wait until 2010 before we get to see if this is just a blooper or in indeed the quality of Nicky's production skills are going downhill. ",3.0
" While `A Day Without Rain' was Enya's summertime album so to say and provided a refreshing change from her usual sombre fare it was a relatively safe affair that really offered nothing new and verged on being mediocre and harmless. `Amarantine' doesn't completely recover from the signs of creative strain already showing in her previous outing but familiar tones from albums past particularly `Watermark' and `The Memory of Trees' will provide something satisfying for existing fans even if this work isn't the best way to be introduced to a songstress who has proven herself many times and better at that before.It stings a little to say that `Amarantine' contains material that doesn't bring itself above the meagre quality of filler but sadly it does. Dreary ballads with almost monotonous melodies and lacklustre arrangements like `It's in the Rain' `I Could Be Where You Are' and `A Moment Lost' contribute nothing to the album other than demonstrating the very worst that Enya's compositions can be should the creative sensibilities that she's exhibited frequently in the past leave her. `It's in the Rain' in particular is an example of how her signature sound of synthesised instruments and vocals could become dated dangerously soon. The title track is a by-the-numbers Enya song that is a highlight inasmuch as it is the title track. It is bland while pleasant and would be unsurprisingly found as a forgettable number on `A Day Without Rain'.Other songs are perhaps best described as shifty. `Someone Said Goodbye' is hummable but plays like a bluesy pop song running on strings instead of drums. The use of a novel language does nothing to help `Sumiregusa' and `Amid the Falling Snow' sounds like it belongs on a compilation of alternative Christmas carols. The lyrics on the entire album are mostly trite and repetitive I'm sorry to say and whatever attempts they make at creating a resonant emotional core fail quite embarrassingly. Even excerpts in Loxian from Roma Ryan's book read like nothing more than faux-philosophical musings that seem to settle for thinking that they cannot go wrong by making convenient references to mystical images and ultimately simplistic metaphors.But the Loxian songs do stand out on this album and it's a pity that there are only three. Be it the sheer invention of the language or the premises that are depicted in it Enya and her team appear to have been intrigued somewhat by Roma Ryan's conception which seems to have revealed to them undiscovered creative spaces. That is a treat precisely because it's what listeners know Enya does best - charting new creative realms and building on them with her music. It's in the exploration of new worlds which always appeals to the imagination that Enya and her song-writing duo shine. `Less Than A Pearl' is an assured and quietly sublime opening matched by a relatively epic conclusion on `Water Shows the Hidden Heart' that plays comfortably with its occasional classical-sounding tinges. `The River Sings' is perhaps the best track on the album absolutely riveting and displaying sheer adventure in the mix of beats and vocals. More importantly it shows what's distinctive about Enya and that quality surely comes in no small part from her experiences with Clannad - which isn't a bad thing at all as `Watermark' and `Shepherd Moons' showed. It's a wonderful feeling when you know a song was simply inspired in its composition and `The River Sings' celebrates that with an easy comfortable and sparklingly energetic groove. In addition one should not forget `Drifting' the only instrumental piece which is a master class in how the unremarkable can be remarkably stirring. One doesn't feel the sting of pity from the lack of a trademark piano tune typically featured in her other albums.But even after an affecting finish one is still inclined to think that `Amarantine' isn't quite amaranthine (and yes - it's spelt with an `h'). While not quite as unmemorable as `A Day Without Rain' threatened to be a disturbingly contemporary creative headspace seems to have taken over - indeed since her previous work - depriving `Amarantine' of the unique sound that's come to be associated with Enya - romanticised ethereal echoes of the past that allow olden beauty to reach across the centuries and become truly transcendent by resonating with our hearts in our time. There isn't even really anything here that bears her beloved Celtic touch and that is woeful. `Amarantine' is quite pitifully less than a pearl and little more than a memory of what's been done much much more proficiently before.

" Yes I know all artists grow and change and I am still a devoted Enya fan. But i have to confess I like her earlier work much more. I'm a little bothered by the sing-songy trend I see emerging in her work. I'm not getting the powerful larger than life images in my mind like i did with her first three CD's. This comes across more as Enya Lite. give me the old style massive sound I fell in love with years ago. ",3.0
" I've been a devoted Enya fan my whole life and after A Day Without Rain I eagerly awaited the next release for five years.The first thing I noticed when I listened to Amarantine was that Enya has changed over the years since ADWR. Most of the songs have an odd singsong-y quality to them that was not present in her previous work. The songs by and large have simpler melodies and I was disappointed by the lack of complexity. Enya's music normally entrances the listener and creates a state of mind all its own. I had great difficulty getting into that state with this album. In a way the songs reminded me of a small child more skipping around and 'me' focused than before. Many of the lyrics don't fit the melodies as they should and a lot of the lyric songs sound more as if they should have been instrumental pieces. I believe there was only one non-vocal piece on Amarantine and if some of the songs with lyrics had been left as instrumental pieces the album as a whole would have been more appealing.On to the good points songs like 'It's In the Rain' and 'The River Sings' evoked more of the feel of A Day Without Rain and Enya's older sound in general capturing the slightly mournful melodies in 'It's In the Rain' and the characteristic and energizing chants in 'The River Sings.' I hope that whenever Enya releases another album (and I hope that it will not be another five years) it will fall more along the lines of the music on A Day Without Rain. Overall this album sounds somewhat experimental and I hope that through this experiment Enya finds the best music she can produce. ",3.0
" Like so many other reviewers I too am a HUGE fan of Enya's and own all her albums listen to them regularly and have been long awaiting the release of a new album! Five years without a new Enya CD is a very long time so excitedly I purchased this CD the day it was released. First time listening to it I was indeed disappointed. It sounded as if--for all the talent that Enya has--that she has suddenly reduced her songs to a limited range of 4 or 5 notes up and down the scale---over and over and OVER again! Talk about monotony! Now however as I've listened to the CD about 15 times I'm beginning to hear more depth to the pieces and I'm starting to enjoy the CD more with each listen. I definitely feel that this CD is an 'acquired taste' and that it takes time and SEVERAL LISTENS to enjoy it. I unabashedly feel that this is NOT Enya's best work! One would think that after five dry years she would produce something really fantastic especially since there's only 12 songs on this CD. Like so many other reviewers have mentioned each song seems to sound so much like other Enya songs from the past--or worse like other songs on THIS very CD as they all tend to blend together and sound so much alike that you can't quite tell where one ends and another begins. That said however now that I've listened several times I'm beginning to appreciate it a bit more and can actually admit to LIKING several of the songs. (I am however still trying to figure out the NEED for a fictional Loxian language no matter how pleasant-sounding it might be....Can't we just stick to English and Gaelic?) I suppose my favorite song is 'The River Sings' because of its refreshing upbeatness in--what seems like--an otherwise sea of slothfulness (although I'm still trying to figure out the NEED for a FICTIONAL language [i.e. Loxian] on this CD no matter how pleasant-sounding it may be. Can't we just stick to English and Gaelic? Why the need to make one up for a music CD such as this? Afterall this music is NOT the soundtrack to a movie like Lord of the Rings...) For personal reasons I've become very attached to the song 'If I Could Be Where You Are' because when I listen to the song I think of my Mom who is in heaven and I wish I could 'find a way to bring her back home'. The hymm-like quality of this song coupled with the lyrics is very moving to me but as I said for personal reasons.(At the risk of repeating myself--but then why not? Enya surely does it....) so much of this CD is repetitive and redundant and it seems a bit like 'leftovers'. For example The song 'Long Long Journey' could well be titled 'On My Way Home Part II' and 'Somebody Said Goodbye' (the MOST redundant song on the CD) could be 'One by One",3.0

It seems as if Whyte lost his train of thought here or was himself bored with the telling of the Camulod tale. Either way his editor needs a kick in the rear for letting this one be published as is.For those who are reading the series and haven't yet gotten to this one I do suggest you read it just to keep following the story to the end but I finally resorted to skiming paragraphs/pages just to get through the really boring parts.Very disappointing this book is.

" I loved the first four books of Whyte's Camulod Chronicles but apparently he lost his way in Fort At River's Bend (book 5). Now in Sorcerer he has recovered quite a bit but still fails to hold a candle to his previous works.Finally Whyte resolves dozens of our expectations and dangling questions. Certain characters have died as we knew they must. Camulod is becoming less Roman and more like the Arthurian Britain we all know. Merlin has now become the sorcerer and Arthur has pulled the sword from the stone and become King of all Britain.Unfortunately the manner in which he did all this... left me far from impressed. While Whyte had spent immense detail on every little meaningless event in previous books he then chaotically rushed through these MAIN events we have been waiting for since The Skystone.It's a shame but after six books- I am no longer interested in how this series will turn out.

" The Freud edge banding system occupies a unique niche between the household iron and multi-thousand dollar (aka 'real production') edgers. So far as I can tell it's the only option for semi-professional production of heat-set edge banding.I find it a highly compromised tool. As the old National Geographics used to say it's in a land of problems and promises. Conceptually it's a darn good idea. The execution could be a whole lot better.Let's look at edge banding for a minute. It's not much thicker than a business card (exclusive of adhesive)and only fractionally wider than the wood it is applied to. It takes a fair amount of heat to soften the glue. The guide system on a bander needs to hold material flat square and unbowed although everything that is being done previously almost guarantees the opposite.The EB100 sometimes does the trick. There's only so much precision one can expect from stamped steel guides. When the machine works it's a lot faster than the household iron. When it doesn't it's hard to resist the temptation to throw the sucker out the window. Although one can remove improperly applied edging it takes more effort than to apply it by hand in the first place.Freud should improve the guide system and the table on the EB100 to make it a truly useful machine. Machined precision guides would are necessary for this operation. And they shoud re-think using heat-set banding on a machine table that is subject to high temperatures. After 20 minutes of operation the front edge of the table peels up. This doesn't impair function it just looks like hell.I know woodworkers that get excellent results from this system. Despite significant experience with precision machinery I can't duplicate their results. Maybe if I were more skilled I could. I am uncomfortable with a machine that makes me guess continually. ",3.0
" This product worked well enough on a recent project that the customer was quite satisfied with the result. On the flip side since this item will only apply pre-glued hot melt adhesive product I'm finding the usefulness limited to white black or unfinished birch edgeband.

Since I can't seem to find anything other pre-glued edgeband I find it's use limited. ",3.0

Pat Kim provides sinisterly smooth basslines and new drummer Tony Palermo keeps the beat going with ruthless ferocity.With its soaring vocal and instrumental melodies infectious hooks and captivating tempos and guitar effects the `Law's sixth release 'Here's To the Mourning' is arguably their most cohesive and well-rounded offering to date.The first single released from 'Here's To' the soaring anthemic 'Save Me' is already enjoying its top-10 perch atop the alternative chart while its video is enjoying substantial rotation on MTV2 VH-1 and Fuse.'Save Me' isn't the only standout track the album boasts. The soaring sing-a-longs 'Celebration Song' 'Because of You' and 'Walrus' the Prozac frenzied 'Hide Away' the funky 'I Like the Way' the stop-and-go 'She Says' and the hard-nosed tracks 'Get Up' 'Lost Control' and 'Rejections Cold' are all radio-friendly tracks itching for radio airplay.While they may never ride the airways the highly energized and roughly anthemic 'F.I.G.H.T.' and hidden track will beat you over the head steal your wallet and kick the cane out from under your grandfather without a second thought.The `Law had us 'Seein' Red' in 2002. With a new hit single and an addictive album they should be seein' continued success in 2005. Now what they do with the added income is anyone's guess. But if their lyrics are any indicator it'll be something illegal...Sounds Like",3.0
" The Good'Get Up transfuses heavy riffs meaty bass lines and tuneful vocals that are on the verge of whining. More of that thunderous bass along with catchy rhythms can be heard on 'Celebration Song'. On 'Lost Control' Brewer and Morris whip out some rapid-fire fretwork while Russo proves you can't go wrong with a whoh-whoh chorus in punk song. 'Save Me' is the band's first single which was co-written with Linda Perry (Courtney Love Pink). It starts off with a subtle drum and bass line that leads into driving distorted riffing. The bridge section mixes up the tempo with a brief ska-type rhythm.Unwritten Law mix it up even more with some funky seventies style guitar twang on 'I Like the Way'. Russo's vocals are strong and empowering as he reaches the lively chorus. 'Rejection's Cold' has an infectious opening lick that endures throughout the track. 'F.I.G.H.T.' had to be written with the thought of becoming a high school football anthem. It opens with a riff that's sure to get your blood pumping and the chorus is delivered by a group of cheerleaders; F-I-G-H-T! Be sure to stick around for the impressive bonus track that rounds out the album.The BadNothingThe VerdictIf you have a song co-written by Linda Perry you're not exactly a punk group. However Unwritten Law seem to fit in well with the new pop-punk movement that's taking over the rock radio scene. Here's to the Morning is loaded with plenty of high-energy anthems that never let up.

" Average. I've been listening to Russo and the boys for solid for three days after getting my mitts on 'Here's to the Mourning.' It's evident like on 'Elva' that the band has undergone some significant changes since hitting the low-end of 90's mainstream California punk rock. In Elva's footsteps the band (or possibly Russo) sings of depression dissatisfaction and addiction. Walrus' 'Everything gets old / everyone is dumb / so i keep changing / everything is gay everyone is fakeso i can't hang around' has me sadly missing self-titled's careful attention to music feeling and ambiguity. 'Hide Away' has Russo chanting 'slow dance take a chance with me / take off your pants with me' and the music often feels unexplored and void of depth.While chalked full of accurate depictions of Russo's sentiments on life the music is uncomfortably hammered into a poppy radio-friendly version of angst punk making the sound and content uncomfortable for lovers of older UL material.The hooks are there and your foot will tap but you'll quickly tire of the lyrical content Russo's new affinity for F-words to fill gaps his depressive tones and lack of sound variety that even Elva managed to contain. First timers and 'Save Me' radio spin-offs would be better off starting with the self-titled CD or Elva. ",3.0

I was able to look back on my own life and clearly see where I stepped out in faith and where I hesitated. After reviewing those experiences it is clear to me that taking the risks believing that God knows what is best for me and will do His best by me has been by far the best part of my journey.After reading this book I can name and claim my experiences as my very own God adventure.

" Satan and his cohorts come to Moscow and wreak havoc. People disappear or need urgent psychiatric treatment and as a hostess for satans ball Woland chooses Margarita who willing accepts in order to free and be with the Masteran oppressed author of a novel about Pontius Pilate...Written during Stalins infamous show trials Bulgakov's use of magic realism does invoke the climate of enforced thinking and terrorand in turn satarises the drabness and tedium of soviet life but for me this book just doesn't shine. Its no '1984' or 'Gullivers Travels' and neither does it give the joy of Garcia Marquez's use of the style. Yes I got the idea abour cowardicw being terrors greatest ally and there's plenty of qoutable scenes but you're often left wondering exactly is the point he is making.(The reading of the introduction and annotations are a must to keep the novel alive)The book was written re written and revised many times between 1928 and 1940 and as a result it does seem over egged. I was put in mind of Bernard Malamud's story about Feidelman whom on painting a masterpiece thought he could make it better and kept altering it so that in the end his masterpiece became a mess!'The Master and Margarita ' isn't a messbut it just doesn't pack the punch its reputed to do. Perhaps you would of have to have suffered the tediums and terrors-not to mention mind numbing 'proliterian literature' controled by the state-to get the full impact. ",3.0
" Which is to say I dont think this novel compares to Lolita Mrs. Dalloway Gargantua and Pantagruel Wuthering Heights and The Stranger in literary quality. The horrific scenes of Satan's taking full advantage of human stupidity and avarice are stunning and entertaining--at least at first. Then they become redundant and tiresome. The second half of this novel suffers from the same flaw that Milton's Paradise Regained suffers. The latter is the story of absolute good winning over evil the former about absolute evil winning over good. Both stories are deficient in that the forces (either good or evil) are absolutely invincible; there is no question of their success thus no tension thus really no reason to go on reading. I found it difficult to plod through the second half of the novel principally because I knew that Woland would succeed would free the Master and Margarita would drive half of Moscow insane yadda yadda. This did not make for very interesting reading. Evil has a huge potential to be interesting because it is imaginative and energetic. Woland is imaginative and meticulous but after the first several hundred people he kills/drives mad fails to interest me in the second half of the book. Also the others of his retinue fail to develop beyond their initial presentations; they become repetitive rather than increasingly intriguing. How many times do we need to hear about Koroviev's check suit and flawed pince-nez or Azezallo's one fang? And I didnt think much of Behemoth's antics either; at first they were amusing (like his attempting to board a tram) but again it gets redundant after several chapters of the same. The structure of the novel is intricate but flawed in my opinion. For instance the epilogue was rather dry and unnecessary. I enjoyed the fanciful scenes of Margarita flying over the city and later on horseback the devil and his retinue flying through the cosmos. I especially enjoyed it after having to endure the seventy-fifth destruction of some part of Moscow by Woland and his band. Don't get me wrong I do think highly of Bulgakov's attempt at an intricate and ambitious novel. For the most part it is provoking especially when considering the atheist Stalinist Russia in which it was written. But I expected more of a crescendo. I didn't care for Woland. He was as interesting as one of the many MacBeth rambling soliloquy's. His ball was about as scarey as a typical halloween costume party. In fiction Satan can (and has) been much more interesting. The Master and Margarita's tale begins as touching but ends rather stale and predictably. To sum up the book succeeds and fails wildly. I would give the first half of the book five stars the second one and a half. Thus the final tally of three. ",3.0
" I was chatting with a chatroom friend who asked me if I had read this book. The chatmate who lives just outside Moscow said this book is very popular in Russia right now. His comment made me curious. I thought I'd read a couple of reviews on this book since I'd never heard of it. The reviewers said this is a great read so I ordered the book.I really didn't see the genius in this 'masterpiece.' I could follow the story line and had no problem with the Russian names but I wasn't able to even find a central plot to this book. I was really intrigued with Satan's ball in which Margartia was the naked hostess where all of the guests had to kiss her knee as they entered. After this I felt the story fell apart. I felt that this was the climactic moment in the story and this scene was in the middle of the book.I would recommend this book to someone who is studying Russian literature but this just isn't the kind of book that you will want to wrap yourself in a blanket and read on a rainy weekend.

" I bought this book because I was interested in a quick overview of the Cold War from which I could choose other books to fill in the gaps on topics that I find interest me. In that respect it is a decent book and I have purchased two other books to continue learning ('The Making of a Counter Culture' by Theodore Roszak and 'Blacked Out' by Alasdair Roberts).The problem with this book is that it has far too much of a 'good vs evil' theme. I would have liked to have seen more of a 'ideology vs ideology' or 'imperialist vs imperialist' theme which would have helped go beyond simple caricatures of the two nations.I was quite disappointed to see how much the book portrayed Gorbachev as an enlightened hero while only casually mentioning that he was quite hated in Russia. Also there was almost no mention of Solzhenitsyn - how is that possible?If you do decide to read this book I suggest you supplement it with the following to help balance things out",3.0

" If only Professor Gaddis had been able to completely clear his mind of leftist biases this would have been a true classic. Unfortunately Gaddis was unable to bring true objectivity to his otherwise excellent concise history of the Cold War.Gaddis repeats the false claim that Mao achieved his takeover of China without significant assistance from the Soviet Union. This is not true. The Soviet Union financed the Chinese Communist Party from its inception. Stalin's minions through the years trained many of the CCP cadres in the Soviet Union. When the Japanese surrendered the Soviets turned over many tons of armaments to the CCP. This bit of dishonesty of Prof. Gaddis' part is not small.With regard to Reagan Gaddis is honest enough to give partial credit to President Reagan for the collapse of the Soviet Union but he minimizes his part preferring to credit Pope John Paul for providing the main impetus. Likewise Gaddis takes up the leftist cant that the Soviet Union was ready to expire as if it were a pile of sand that needed only a few grains more on top to make it topple. This petulant refusal to grant credit where credit is due detracts from an otherwise fine historical study.Gaddis shows himself to be as much a slave to the left as was any of Stalin's minions. He blatantly states that 'once the liberation of [Kuwait] began early in 1991 Saddam Hussein found his military deployments so visible and therefore so exposed to attack that he had no choice but to withdraw.' This is one of the leftwing rationales intended to deny credit to George H.W. Bush Margaret Thatcher and the other leaders who were brave enough to confront those who supported the tyrant Hussein. Hussein kept his troops in place until they were practically surrounded at which point the troops panicked and tried to run. This kind of distortion should have been beneath Gaddis; alas it was not.Finally without exhausting the list Gaddis waves his politically correct credentials when referring to a comment by Karl Marx. Gaddis is at pains to refer to Marx's use of the 'sexist terminology of 1852' when he said that '[m]en make their own history.' Of what relevance to anything except doctrinaire left-wing political correctness is Gaddis' comment?There are numerous other tinged comments in Gaddis' work. It is a pity they exist because The Cold War could have been a truly excellent history. As it is it does provide a concise history of how the Cold War came to be how the struggle was fought and ultimately if inaccurately how the Soviet Union and some of its satellites threw off Communism. But The Cold War must be read with wariness because of its author's tendency to subtly shade the truth.Jerry ",3.0
" John Lewis Gaddis has done the general reader a service by writing a relatively short book about the entire Cold War period. Serious students and scholars will probably find themselves saying 'I am familiar with these events and Gaddis's take on them so why did I buy the book?' That is a fair question but the book does encapsulate the key points of Gaddis's interpretations of major issues so if one is seeking such an overview of the 1946-1991 era with a conservative tilt one could certainly do worse than The Cold War",3.0
" Simply spectacular. I only wish the book were twice as large and twice as detailed. There is so much to cover for example that the Cuban Missile Crisis receives only one page.Gaddis has written much on the cold war and this was for all intents and purposes his attempt to 'dumb it down' to a more accessible survey. In this he has succeeded and from here I will turn to his other more detailed writing on the period. ",3.0
" I bought this book with the expectation that it would provide a comprehensive overview of the events episodes personalities motivations and results of the Cold War. A reader looking for something similar might be disappointed. This book does not really attempt to be a comprehensive history of the Cold War but is rather a collection of chapters each devoted to a particular thematic aspect of the war. It reads as though Gaddis has a particular thesis about the Cold War that he wants to flesh out in each chapter rather than telling the whole story in an orderly narrative.As examples",3.0
" Given that this is a rather slim book (266 pages) to cover the Soviet/American rivalry that defined the world from 1945 to 1989 I suppose one could expect that it skims the surface rather than covers any aspect of the Cold War in depth.I just finished it and I feel like I read the Cliffs Notes version of a larger more complex book. Gaddis is reported to be working on a biography of George Kennan. Perhaps his energies are being put into that book. This certainly is not the definitive history of the Cold War. We're still waiting on that and the time for it may be about right.Several other reviewers commented on the truly wierd section in Chapter II where the book veers off into alternative history and I was certainly stunned and puzzled by it because it was so out of character with the rest of the book. But I wonder if more of that approach if it were better labeled would have actually helped. After all what was remarkable about the Cold War was what did NOT happen. ",3.0
" This is not your traditional linear account of events as we have come to know most other history books. This is a variety of asynchronos snapshots of key figures during the cold war and the people and events surrouding them.This format is interesting but not quite what I expected.

Each chapter is a story unto itself so do not feel compelled to read this book in long sittings - here and there will get you through. Good commuting reading.I liked this book but I felt that Gaddis (or his editors) held back in the interest of selling more books. This is dissappointing.

" This book is written for laymen not specialists as explicitly state in the book's preface. Hence the question to ask does it succeed in this regard? The answer is in a very average way. By this this reviewer means that this book is pretty much not distinguishable from the large number of books written on the same subject. No new insights analyses or facts are offered that can break this book out from its myriad competition. Hence the average rating. If a reader is interested in such an average overview of the Cold War the book will perform as expected. It covers all the basics but with the problems cited above. In other words it is a useful introductory primer to the subject but nothing else. ",3.0
" I picked up this book because I wanted to have a greater understanding of the events of the Cold War. I grew up in the eighties so most of my memories are confined to the Reagan-Gorbachev era. I knew of the Berlin Wall Cuban Missile Crisis Korean War etc. but I didn't have a clear idea of the details surrounding these important events.Unfortunately while Gaddis' book is an easy read and provides fascinating analysis he seems to assume that the reader is already familiar with the events of the Cold War. For example the Cuban Missile Crisis is covered in about five pages and while the events are alluded to I still have no idea exactly what happened or when it happened how people reacted at the time etc. The author mentions the event and proceeds directly to the analysis.I have not finished the book yet and will probably not pick it up again until I read a more factually in-depth work on the Cold War. This is disappointing because the author states in the introduction that he wrote this book as a self-contained work on the Cold War intended for beginners. In that respect I think he has failed. ",3.0
" The book has a promising pedigree. Gaddis is a leading scholar on the Cold War known well for his effective teaching and the author of a very good general book on the first half of the Cold War. This book unfortunately comes nowhere near satisfying the expectations raised by its provenance. A significant problem with the book is its organization and length. The Cold War is structured as a series of roughly chronological essays on important aspects of the Cold War. Gaddis sometimes cuts back and forth chronologically and the amount of actual narrative history is relatively modest. Putting the essential narrative and analytic overview into a book of this length (slightly over 250 pages)would be difficult perhaps impossible and Gaddis has not even tried. The result consequently is that this book can be read easily only by people who already have some familiarity with the basic history of the Cold War. This is a major defect in what is supposed to be an introductory book. A somewhat longer book incoporating more narrative perhaps with summary devices like time-line charts would really be necessary for an introductory book.Perhaps because of the brevity of the book The Cold War suffers also from an overly restricted focus. What Gaddis presents is largely an account and analysis of US-Soviet relations particularly emphaszing the Washington end. There is no doubting the importance of this feature of the Cold War. But Gaddis leaves too schematic an impression of how events unfolded during the Cold War. A comparison with his prior general work We Know Now is instructive. In that volume he emphasized not only the importance of the US-Soviet relationship but also the crucial roles and relative autonomy of many other actors. To be fair its not that Gaddis doesn't mention this phenomena but it gets short shrift in this account. For example the crucial European role in initiating and nurturing the establishment of NATO which he discusses nicely in We Know Now receives one sentence in The Cold War. In another example of the excessive focus on Washington and Moscow Gaddis does discuss how the nature of Cold War allegiances often allowed secondary or minor powers to manipulate their relationships with the US or the Soviet Union but his emphasis in on how these actors affected the behavior of the US and Soviet Union rather than how their overall impact on events.The restricted focus of the book probably reflects also Gaddis' prior scholarly interests in the origins of the Cold War the nature of US policy and the US-Soviet relationship. Gaddis clearly drew from his prior books and while this probably made this book easier to write it has come with some cost. The best parts of The Cold War are the sections dealing with the earlier phases of the Cold War and the second half of the book is not nearly as good.Gaddis doesn't deal at all with one of the major features of the Cold War its often devastating effects in the Third World. Our (unavoidable) rivalry with the Soviets and the entanglement with proxy conflicts in many parts of the world often transformed localized low level conflicts into disastrous events. This is one of the major legacies of the Cold War and hardly dealt with in this book. Gaddis writes at some length (relative to the rest of the book) about the US support of democratic institutions as a key feature of the eventual triumph of the West. This applies with considerable justice to our policies in Europe and East Asia but in many other regions this was hardly true. Gaddis's discussion of these issues is shallow to non-existent.Probably the most controversial chapter will be the discussion of the end of the Cold War. I found this section somewhat superficial and overemphasizing the role of Western leaders like Reagan and Thatcher. To be fair Gaddis does not indulge in the triumphalist rhetoric of many American conservatives who see the Soviet Union bludgeoned into submission by Reagan but his treatment of Reagan is considerably more positive than some others. Raymond Garthoff's The Great Transition for example is a detailed analysis of US-Soviet diplomacy in this period and contains a considerably more negative assessment of Reagan.A good overview of the Cold War would be valuable but this book is not that volume.

" For the most part Dr. Crabb has aimed his book at Christian couples. And several things I can wholeheartedly agree with",3.0
" This is an amazing book using the term 'amazing' without necessarily meaning anything either positive or negative.Crabb promotes a Biblical idea of the difference in gender roles. He supports his points by scriptural reference by referring to his counseling and to common sense.If you don't like his goal if you have the modern view of such things this book will make your teeth hurt. Not only will his goals set your hair on fire he is above all plausible. He is not slick-plausible. He is a good writer and organizer of his material.For those who disagree even vehemently disagree with his views it would be an educational experience to deal with his book using logic and reason. Ripping it to shreds and jumping up and down on the scraps while screaming obscenities--which passes for scholarship in some fields--is not what I'm talking about. Deal with this book whatever your position with reason logic and fact and you will know more about among other things what you think and why you think it.I was particularly struck by his extensive investigation into how a wife's regard for her husband can build him up or ruin him. The same is mentioned in passing by other writers in the fiels but Crabb goes into some detail.Crabb spends the bulk of his time exploring marital issues. It appears to me that if men and women are to take gender-separate roles the manifestations of such differences would be in the workplace or in other groups. Crabb doesn't get into this. I expect that telling a woman to be a helpmate and to accept husband's decisions with a joyful and grateful heart is going to create some confusion when a woman is an equal colleague of a man at work or a supervisor.

They might actually make your feet *too* hot. So think about what you want out of a slipper before you buy these. If you really like your feet being hot go for it. if you just want something to keep your feet from touching the cold floor maybe try a style that doesn't contain your feet in the same way.

The clog has both arch support and heel cushion and is very warm.

My guess is they are more like a 9. I had them on for maybe 2 minutes evaluating the likelihood these would loosen up in time but I believe the only way for these to fit an 11 is to cut the toe off and no I'm not cutting the toes off the slippers or my feet so unfortunately they must go back.What a shame!

" I purchased the pink Highlander Sheepskin Cuff Bootie slipper. I wear size 8 1/2 shoe and ordered the size 9 slipper. At first I thought it felt a little snug in the toe area on the top of my foot but after wearing them 3-4 times this area loosened up and they fit just right. After a year of wear they have become plenty loose enough - that's how sheepskin works.These slippers have the traditional slipper thickness for the sole which some reviewers did not like - they wanted more padding. After about a year of wearing these I would agree. The sole could benefit from thicker padding as it would add to the overall warmth factor of this slipper. The bottoms of my feet still feel the cold from the floor in the winter although my feet generally stay warm enough in spite of this. The cuffs are warm and sort and you can fold them up or down.These slippers are fine for the price and if you live in a relatively warm climate where the winters stay above 32 degrees Fahrenheit they will provide more than adequate warmth. If you need a thick-soled slipper for whatever reason I would recommend you look at something else. I doubt these will ever wear out - sheepskin is sturdy stuff.

" The October 161995 'Million Man March' marked Louis Farrakhan as the ' unoffical President of Black America'. The year was 1995 when Louis Farrakhan(the leader of the Nation of Islam) called for the Million Man March as an 'Holy Day of Atonement'. As a result the march that was held at the Nation's Capitol had hosted an estimated 2 million Black Men! Black men from every social and political stem attended the march. His guess speaks included the Rev. Jesse Jackson Maya Anglou and a host of others. Who else could have commanded the attention of the Black community in that way? Is Farrakhan the President of Black America?Although the Million Man March was design to create solidarity between Black men on a larger scale the mission failed. Crime Highschools dropouts drug additions and other factors that lurk in the Black experience hasn't went away. Perhaps the Minister's sexist racist and anti-semitic views got the better of him. Speaking of his anti-semitism if you look closley you would see that he marked the event as a 'Holy Day of Atonement'. The Holy Day of Atonement(Yom Kippur) is a Jewish Holiday! Whith that in mind I have exposed Farrakhan for who he really is. Another good question is why were woman not allowed to attend the March in large numbers? Didn't Black woman fight for the same freedoms with there Black male counterparts? And what about Harriet Tubman? Didn't she make as great an impact on our people as say Dr. King and Malcolm X? Apperantly Louis Farrakhan doesn't think so. How can Farrakhan expect Black people to rise when the Million Man March excluded Black woman? Unfortunately his march was destined to fail.The Nation of Islam's reasons for an all Black Million Man March are fallible. Louis Farrakhan has said that women would be a distraction. He also said that Black women would not focus on improving our people instead they would lust for Black men. Is there any more proff needed to convince anyone that he is also a sexist? Long before the march the popularity and approval of Louis Farrakhan has made African American and White leaders sit up and take notice. In 1994 Farrakhan had been given an invitation to speak at an Conferance hosted by the NAACP. He has also made serveral apperances on t.v. programs such as the Arsenio Hall Show Meet the Press and Fox News. Louis Farrakhan is the man to look at. But although many Blacks share his love for Black people I believe that they will never fully embrace his teachings(Thank G-d)! ",3.0

" Some years ago I used what was then called the Crown Skinless Skin condom which are now sold with the simple moniker of Crown Condoms. I was very pleased with this original product. It's thin strong structure held up under some of the most strenuous 'loads' that I could produce and contributed to the advertised 'feels like you're wearing nothing' experience. Light lubrication and a skin-toned color only contributed to this adage.What I received from my recent order was not the same condom even if it was advertised as such. At first these condoms seemed to promise the same feeling but all I can say is that they were not 'lightly' lubricated - they were practically not lubricated at all. And that would be fine (I happen to like non-lubricated condoms) but for some reason this condom was no easier to apply than one drenched in lubrication.During use I found it somewhat constrictive. It did not contribute to a comfortable experience. When I finally DID manage to reach my climax I realized the only reason that was possible was because the condom broke! Thankfully my partner is on birth control so no surprises were in store for us.The only truly positive aspect of this condom? It's VERY inexpensive when bought in numbers.

The Thai version is visibly more opaque and looks thicker (though the company swears that they are actually thinner now). More importantly they feel much thicker and smell just a little bit more of latex. While the old Japanese version was incredible and a joy to use the new Thai condoms feel very much like the desensitizing thick hunks of rubber you'll find in a truck stock rest room only to be used as a last depressing and disappointing resort. Basically any reviews before 2010 are probably of the old stock condoms and are thus out of date.

" Charles Darwin's The Origin of species was published in 1859 and he basically believes and tried to prove that different varieties of species will come about because of direct or indirect action of the species with the surrounding environment and/or conditions and also from the use and disuse of certain inherited functions. Which than leads to the Struggle for Life and thus you have Natural Selection which means that species that are not the best equipped to survive become extinct.This book is packed with examples of his theories. I was impressed with all the information he had gathered over his twenty years or so of research.I also do not see how anyone after reading this book could say that Charles Darwin's theory proved that a Creator or God does not exist. Darwin himself referenced many times to a Creator. He even said 'I see no good reason why the views given in this volume should shock the religious feelings of any one.' And he also said 'Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some primordial form into which life was first breathed by the Creator.'Not only that but he himself understands that there are still many problems with his theory. I was impressed that he included and admitted problems with the theory. For example he said 'Why if species have descended from other species by insensibly fine gradations do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms? And he also said 'Can we believe that natural selection could produce... organs of such wonderful structure as the eye of which we hardly as yet full understand the inimitable perfection?In the end even though I myself am still a skeptic towards the theory that simple organisms have evolved into many different complex species I would recommend reading this book if not for anything to see how the evolutionary theory got started and though Darwin's theory has changed since his time it would be a good read still for historical purposes if nothing else. Enjoy... ",3.0
" Some time ago I found Darwin's 'Origin' in a second hand store. More than a hundred years old except for the [presumably] original owner's name written elegantly inside the cover with a quill it showed no sign it had ever been opened. Possessing a pleasant 'old book' smell but having no marks stains or dog-eared pages it had rested unexamined apparently for several generations. Then I came along and -- viola! -- punctuated equilibrium.Darwin's writing style is engaging his lines of thought easy to follow. He did not 'discover' or 'invent' 'evolution.' Classical philosophers long ago discussed evolutionary ideas St. Augustine among them. Aristotle taught that the extent to which biological forms could change was tightly restricted. Many held this view in Darwin's day but many did not. Many believed that species had evolved from earlier forms but no one had proposed a coherent mechanism for such a theory. Lamarck's theory of evolution failed to impress most thinkers because it smacked of vitalism and couldn't describe how changes might be heritable. Where Lamarck's theory failed Darwin's was seen as succeeding. It is apparent to this reader however that in critical areas Darwin's arguments often 'beg the question' -- in their underlying metaphysical assumptions and logic and also in terms of the difficulty resolving mathematical incongruities in 'the struggle for survival by means of natural selection.'Problems of mathematics",3.0
" I figured while I was on my evolution book kick I might as well go back to the original (well sort of the original Alfred Russel Wallace published a paper on natural selection which prompted Darwin to publish this 'abstract'). Now that I'm finished I feel two different ways about the book a loved yet bored type of feeling. First I'm amazed at just how much of Darwin's theories and ideas are accurate and accepted even today 150 years later (which is a pretty darn long time in science). One thing you have to appreciate about this book is that its pretty evident that Darwin didn't just rush out and publish this theories but thought about every possible question everyone could have and he attempts to answer them all. Another question he spends a lot of time on is how flora could make it to islands he goes through page after page of experiments trying to see how long seeds can stay in salt water and still germinate. Even better way back 150 years ago Darwin already anticipated the irreducible complexity argument of the eye and proposed his own ideas about how the eye could evolve and how each gradation is useful in itself. Some times the prose was pretty amazing I think the famous line about 'There is grandeur in this view of life.....' is one of my favorites in any book I've read.So as amazing as some parts where why then did I rate it 3 stars? Well for every amazing part there are page after page of material which is (to me) just plain boring. The prose which is great in sections is pretty tedious in other parts. The fact that he thought of every question means that he goes over proof after proof. Remember the salt water and the seeds mentioned above well its cool at first but 40 pages of his experiments makes me start to care less and less. There were also a few parts which he got wrong he spends a whole section trying to figure out why certain animals can't cross breed something which is quickly addressed now days with DNA. I think at another part he denies that there ever were any mass extinctions (something we know happened several times in the earth's history). Another thing which made the book a little harder for me is Darwin mentions lots of people and animals I've never heard of of course a better reader would have spend time looking them up but I just read on I guess I didn't care enough to do that much research for the book.So overall for importance I'd rate this book a 5/5 but I have to factor in enjoyment and I so its gets the lower score. Truthfully this book is 150 years old and written in Victorian English its very important but there are better books on evolution out there so if you're curious about the fascinating world of evolution start elsewhere only if you're curious about how the theory got started pick this one up.

" Darwin's _Origin of Species_ is a phenomenal work and was truly brilliant and insightful at the time. It's a classic of science and it's one of those books that everyone should read.That said this particular Kindle edition of the book is disappointing. Primarily the text is fully-justified rather than normal left-aligned (right-ragged). (This means that spacing between words varies so that the last characters of each line end up being aligned along the righthand margin and the first characters are still aligned along the left margin.) It's a well-known principle of typography that justified text is harder to read than ragged text -- the spacing between words is variable so your eyes have to work harder to move over the text. I don't see why this edition would have made that choice.If you want to read this excellent book you might consider a different edition. ",3.0
" Darwin's 'Origin of Species' is in fact an abstract of a 20 volume thesis containing the evidence gathered over many years which support the concept of evolution by natural selection. This way of describing the evolution of organisms on earth has by now become the standard and in fact one hardly ever thinks of evolution without automatically connecting it with Darwin's ideas.At first upon commencing reading this small book I continued to ask `where is the evidence for that' but on realising that he had gathered a large volume of data to support this theory I simply continued to read on. Its not either an easy read or that complicated. Darwin looks at evolution in a very comprehensive way",3.0

" This book is hardly earth-shattering. Everything in it has been said before and better by others.Most disturbing are the almost myopic attacks on the Church prior to the Council. In the introduction the Catholic faithful from before Vatican II are almost vilified for how much they used the confessional. The fact that Catholics went to confession when they only had venial sins to confess seems to the priest who wrote this book and the priest who wrote the introduction as silly and outmoded. As someone who loves the old Mass I found the introductory chapters so insulting it was a struggle to get through the rest of the book.This knee-jerk need to attack the past needs to GO.

" With a typist out sick and a huge brief to get ready Perry Mason and his assistant Della Street call an agency for an emergency typist. A typist shows up. Although she seems terrified she does a great job on the brief. So great that Mason is ready to offer her a job--until she vanishes without being paid. When Mason learns that the building had suffered a burglary and that the police had been looking everywhere for a certain young woman he realizes that he and his office had fallen for a mistaken identity. When one of the jewel dealers in Mason's building is accused of murder--and the typist clearly implicated Mason needs to get to the bottom of more mistakes than that one.The evidence against the jewel dealer isn't strong. A jewel smuggler went missing--but there is no body to show. Still District Attorney Hamilton Burger seems highly confident--so confident that Mason believes he has an ace up his sleeve.The story alternates between the streets where Mason Della Street and private detective Paul Drake attempt to track down witnesses and the courtroom where Mason battles the smug Hamilton Burger. This time though it seems that the District Attorney really does have the edge. While Mason can make his legalistic arguments the jury is swayed by a beautiful young woman--the terrified typist.Author Erle Stanley Gardner throws his lawyer/sleuth a case where even Mason isn't sure what is going on--and where nothing is quite what it seems to be. The story also provides an interesting viewport into the 1950s where working women were referred to as 'girls' where these women wore gloves and stockings and were judged on their figures as well as on their typing skills and where professional jobs seemed reserved for men.This isn't the best of Perry Mason or Erle Stanley Gardner but it definitely has some enjoyable moments.

" I have very mixed feelings about this book. Diane Duane is of course a great author and everything she writes is well worth reading. That said I really didn't find myself enthralled by this book as I have by others in the Young Wizards series. It was a good enough read and I enjoyed it. But that essential 'magic' that sets it apart from the average fantasy book was somehow missing.My personal hunch is that the series has just gone on too long. The first three books were amazing mind-expanding earth-shattering high fantasy at its best. Here we had a couple of teenagers pitted against the evil Lone Power and the fate of the world New York or the entire universe at stake. These books were exciting enthralling cliffhangers that you just couldn't put down. Even now chills go up and down my spine when I read certain parts of Deep Wizardry (probably my favorite in the series.) The first three books culminated in the defeat and redemption of the Lone Power at the end of High Wizardry.The mistake I think was in continuing the series. After High Wizardry the 'high fantasy' aspects of the books began to disappear which was quite understandable. I mean how much further could Duane possibly go in that direction after the epic battle between Dairine and the Lone Power at the end of High Wizardry? (A Wizard Abroad attempted to retain the 'epic' character of the previous three and did not succeed IMHO.) Instead Duane had her characters turn inward dealing with themselves and the issues in their own lives instead of saving the universe. The fifth and sixth books are very introspective and as character-development novels they are very interesting. However as fantasy they are lacking that essential tension that characterized the first three books. In High Wizardry the fate of the universe was at stake; in Wizard's Dilemma it's the fate of Nita's mother. (Not to say that this isn't important in its own way -- it just doesn't create the same atmosphere of nervous excitement.) In the first book of the series the characters explore an alternate universe; in the sixth book they spend most of the time in a single person's mind. The focus of the series has shifted from the macroscopic cosmic and epic to the microscopic introspective and personal. And while nothing is wrong with this in itself it's not what I look for in a fantasy book.Another problem is that not as many new ideas are being introduced. In the first three books the characters were still discovering their own magic and all its aspects. There was an atmosphere of exciting discovery. In this last book however the characters have adopted a 'been there done that' attitude to magic. Magic has become routine and predictable; while in the first two books the characters were out discovering new universes here Kit uses his skills to...fix his VCR by persuading it to work with his TV. (Yawn.) Magic somehow just isn't *magic* anymore...In summary though this book is a good piece of writing it is somehow missing that essential spark that would give it life like the 'dragon's eye' mentioned in the Wizard's Dilemma. However the book is well worth reading and was highly interesting in several ways (such as its portrayal of an autistic child) if not as exciting as I hoped. ",3.0

" Smith's novel tells the story of a girl growing up in the south. What starts out as a simple nine-year old's telling of how she spent her summer becomes a thought provoking piece as it not only shows the issues someone her age would face but also causes the reader to question how a nine year old might deal with the difficult issue of rape and how one might respond to someone devoid of any morals.In Smith's novel the main character 'grows up' during the summer bouting with a family falling apart and discovering for the first time what evil is through the character of Eugene. What Smith creates is a disturbing coming of age novel that stands the test of time as we see the main character forced to grow up learning things faster than she ought because of the little support she receives from her detorraiting family.Smith causes the reader to question how we underestimate what children see and in doing that they may suffer. The main character describes her family in a fictitious light using a fairy tale facade to represent 'the queen' and 'the princess' of her household and is forced to use nature as a substitute family. What reads initially as a simple story of a child ends a strong thought provoking piece. ",3.0

I would recommend this book to other since it helps open the eye of the reader on the behind the scenes of corporation and government actions. The author is a liberal with some great ideas on how to prevent further corporate disasters for greedy 'Fat Cat'. Her ideas I thought were a little too 'idealistic' since corporate America and the government have been working together for the past several generations. Although with the Internet and technology the public can help with some of the authors ideas. The thought I left with was the fact that as the public we need to demand more from our government and be afraid of the corporations.Have fun reading. ",3.0
" Pigs at the Trough is a fantastic look into corporate greed. Not only does the book expose the unfair buisness practices of crooked CEOs but also the great gap between them and thier workers. The book explains that what happens upstairs at a large corporation is much different. Huffington shows how the upper one percent of the world is getting away with murder and still making more than the lower eighty percent of the entire world.Overall Pigs at the Trough was an excellent read. You will find yourself repulsed by the leaders of Walmart and Tyco but at the same time will not be able to put it down. Inform yourself and read this book. ",3.0
" Prior to the 1860s only businesses that served the public could be incorporated. With diversified ownership management became separated from ownership and the scandals began. Greed arises from human nature when there is little control or regulation. The 'Introduction' shows how top management can squander resources when ownership is so diluted that the owners can't control management. If a privately owned company did this there would be no publicly owned shares that lose value. Borrowed money must be repaid; corporate bonds are preferable to shares. Today's scandals echo those from the Gilded Age. One difference is the lack of small family farms; that Frontier has been closed. The lack of a political party to represent the interests of the common people is shown by the absence of half the voters at the polls.This book does not tell why CEOs were rewarded for failures and losses (p.40). Are stock options deductible business expenses to lower taxes? Does this inflate reported earnings? The accounting scandals resulted from changed rules. The 401K plan was to provide additional retirement income but many companies are doing away with defined benefit pensions. There is a tax avoidance scam when relocating a corporation offshore (pp.55-8). Arianna's complaints about CEOs in the Bush Administration overlooks past history going back to Washington's day. The function of 'Chainsaw Al' was to purge the mistakes of past management to prevent bankruptcy; senior management keep their hands clean.'The Bloodless Coup' tells of further oppression of 'low to middle-class people' (p.80). Payoffs or 'lobbying' also goes back to the 1870s and the rise of corporations. Arianna suggests the 'banquet of greed' is a new thing; 'The Monied Metropolis' proves otherwise. 'Wealth and Democracy' shows it going on since the 19th century. Closeness to government power translates to wealth and subsidies franchises monopolies etc. The Glass-Steagal Act regulated investment banks and their analysts; it was gone in the mid 1990s (p.155). Doesn't the Internet stock craze echo the Railroad companies of the 1870s and their Federal Land Grants?New York residents can thank Eliot Spitzer for prosecuting crooks who rob you with a fountain pen (pp.165-7). Page 169 tells how the 'pump and dump' worked at CNBC. The chart on pages 176-181 will help you to learn 'new speak'. 'The Binge and the Reckoning' notes the consequences of prior actions. Destroying the regulations from the 1930s led to the 1990s binge (pp.213-4); are we in another Depression? Why were there no reforms passed after the ENRON scandal? The Corporations were against it (p.215)! Page 231 lists some of the likely suspects",3.0

" Stanley the Bugman's console debut was never as popular as Mario's starring in Donkey Kong and Jr and for good reason.The game is a shooter in disguise as a limited platformer. The goal is to spray Donkey Kong up to the top of the vines he climbs with a bug sprayer while also shooting distracting bugs that try to take away your flowers.When Stanley dies he looks like as if he just died like how Mario does in Donkey Kong but in the arcade version that's not the case. In the original bugs would swoop down and eat off Stanley (Thankfully there's no blood. His body just disappears) I can see why that was censored in the NES game.Unlike the first two games Donkey Kong 3's levels are all identical with just the color palliate changed. ",3.0
" I got this movie expecting to see a thriller based on fact. What I got instead was a teen-flick that seemed more like Scream than a movie about the powerful elite that (purportedly) runs countries and continents. Don't get me wrong however this movie is definitely a thriller but it isn't sinister enough. The Skulls seem more like a group of spoilt brats than a highly efficient secret organization filled with the best minds.The story was not very credible how do a group of teenagers bring down such a secretive society that is said to span the globe? Surely the Skulls are not so incompetent as to allow a teen-journalist to enter their most sacred chambers with such ease and steal all their secrets.There must be better movies about the skulls out there because this one was a real disappointment. I can only recommend this movie to those who like thrillers just don't get this movie if you are expecting an expose on the skulls.There was one reviewer who said he would have liked to see Jackson and Walker more physically involved with each other. It amazes me that there are such deviants who watch these movies to fulfill their perverted fantasies. The movie was about the Skulls not about homoerotic fantasies. ",3.0
" This movie could have expanded so well in some many different areas. Covering in far more detail how the society operated the benifits and a whole lot else. But it chose to be very ambiguous.There is no hero of the film as the main character is manipulated from the very begining of the film to the very last line.For a secret society alot of people knew of its excistence.After watching it I felt that there was more to be told more to have experienced from the film. It just didn't go the extra mile.However all that being the case it is an enjoyable film to watch. Not one that I would want to own but I am happy to have seen it. Rent it rather than buy. ",3.0
" THE SKULLS (Dir. Rob Cohen 2000 106 minutes) is an easy film to review being so many years old and not so big a hit as everyone thought it might become. Essentially the plotline and story consists of the typical almost-juvenile-delinquent college kid (the gorgeous Joshua Jackson) who gets tapped by the secret society of his university (the Order of the Skulls). His two beloved friends are really allegories and not characters - one the weirdly gay and obsessed black guy (the very cute Hill Harper) and the other being the college kid's girlfriend (Leslie Bibb).Of course this is a see-through film and I always try to claim that I hate that kind of thing. The moral bar is set quite high and then the story is told in almost juvenile fashion. Aside from the girl who represents American innocence and the black sidekick who represents freedom there is a spoilt effeminate brat-frat guy (Paul Walker) who becomes the kid's Fellow in the order. Naturally do not forget the film not only goes out of its way to make everyone heterosexual but actually reveals a contemptuously subtle homophobia.Way to go with the moral allegories.I must admit that as pure popcorn brainlesstainment [my term don't steal it] this film has become a favorite. I can always speed past the whiny college radio station music which this film lavishes (I would say 'inflicts') on the viewer; but the other side of this coin is the kids in the film are not too snotty or ridiculous. In fact the film goes far out of its way to show how immaturely evil the adults are as represented by Craig T. Nelson who plays the psychopathic judge Walker's father and head of the order.The elusive William Petersen rounds out the cast as the senator-with-a-conscience who is also a member of the order.Though I agree this fictional school is modeled on Yale (the University of Toronto naturally standing in as the location) it seems rather fruitless to try to pin it with that frat pin. Yale has its legendary Skull and Bones society and I think we can see where that is leading us. However recall the year this was released - and hopefully that will dissuade you from looking for George W. Bush anywhere in the bushes.It is a fun family film if your family leans toward this kind of intellectual trash (I did say it was brainlesstainment). However I would not watch it if you like a few of my old friends are Yale graduates - it would be too insulting. It was good enough to spawn two rotten sequels totally unrelated to the characters of this. There's nothing like an original especially when it was mediocre enough to spawn two nyquels [another of my terms don't steal it!]. ",3.0
" I Expected Garbage what I received was a very good movie. Sure It takes itself a little serious and the plot twists can be a little on the unbelievable side but i leave the complaining to the Critics. The Actors young and old are Above Average. Rob Cohen's Direction is Heavy-Handed and a little on the Overly- Serious side but still better than alot in this Genre. In fact that what probably lifts this film and makes it better than the material they hired a seasoned film director (who knows how to hold a shot for more than 10 seconds) instead of a 20 year old Music Video director (all flash and no substance good for some films but not for this genre). Being that I expected Garbage has alot to do with my enjoyment level if I had went in expecting something great I probably wouldn't be so leanient. ",3.0
" You could only expect to be entertained at a basic level by this wave of insipid 13 year old girl-geared teenybopper movies and this one is no excetion. Pathetic acting from people who were only hired for looks a plot full of huge holes and too much eye candy abound. BUT I have to admit it on a purely campy male-fantasy level this is worth watching. Leave your analytical mind at the door and just watch this for the sets the clothes the money and the paraphernalia. The set designer deserves most of the credit-the dramatic Skull sets are worth watching along with the toney spacious dorm rooms(they're ridiculously large and overly-furnished-ask any college kid). A particularly pleasing set is Caleb's bachelor pad-esque room furnished to the nines beyond what any kid could afford. Of course all of the sabbath-like rituals are undeniably appealingthe same goes for the GQ fashion and the extraneous skull props. So moviegoers don't think at all on this one it will just give you a headache rather just watch it to imagine a life almost nobody can have. ",3.0
" Though it poses a good moral dilemma 'Skulls' is presented in such an implausible way as to render it crippled at birth. Luke McNamara is a small town boy of modest means attending an Ivy League institution that is never really named but is obviously Yale. He is hoping to be called for membership into the Skulls a secret society of great status and power. Members of this society have the doors of power wealth and influence thrown wide to them. This is a dream come true for Luke who spends much of his time fretting over the hundreds of thousands in student loans he is incurring. When he discovers that one of the members has committed a felony he is torn between his desire for wealth his loyalty to a friend and his conscience.Writer John Pogue ('U.S. Marshals') has conjured up a good moralistic tale but it is so full of ridiculous premises that it becomes laughable. This is supposed to be a secret society where other than the members themselves no one knows who the members are. Yet Pogue and director Rob Cohen present it in such a way that they may as well be advertising their identities on TV. The building where the secret meetings take place is prominently marked with a Skull and only members have keys to the building. So Duh anyone seen entering the building must be a Skull. New members get brand new $50000 automobiles and $100000 in cash as if no one will notice this sudden burst of good fortune. The new members are branded on their wrist and we are supposed to believe that they will never be seen by anyone without their wristwatch on. The list of inconceivability goes on ad nauseam.The acting is generally quite good. Joshua Jackson ('Cruel Intentions' 'Urban Legend') is excellent as Luke. He plays the part with just the right combination of idealistic zeal and moral grounding. He gets great support from Paul Walker ('She's All That' 'Varsity Blues') as Caleb Mandrake the spoiled rich kid trying to step out of his father's shadow. Craig T. Nelson gives a wonderfully nefarious performance as the chairman of the Skulls and Caleb's father.Maybe secret societies exist and maybe they don't. The fact that no one is sure indicates that if they are more than mere myths they are a lot more secret than depicted here. I rated this film a 6/10. It is an interesting idea that loses credibility in the telling. ",3.0
" I enjoyed this movie. Nothing fancy just an light-interesting story and some solid acting. From some of the reviews I read apparently it's not for everyone-but those people should review the movie and not inject their pet peeves or like or dislikes for an actor.

" 'The Skulls' is your basic unbelievable thriller that unfortunately takes itself completely seriously!The only likeable character in the film is murdered early on but still there is lots to enjoy and mock as we learn more about this secret society.But who can really dislike a film that features a crewing contest the one-note keanu-ish performance of Joshua Jackson a crewing contest and zero plausiblity. Cheesy to the core. ",3.0
" I have been an entertainment critic for some time now and I dont think I started watching this movie with the intent to see an Oscar winning movie. I think in the end with movies like this one they have to be judged on whether the movie was entertaining or not; and this one was...just barely. What was surprising was that this movie was kept afloat by Paul Walker who plays more of a supporting actor rather than Joshua Jackson the lead who makes rather a mess of his role. Jackson has shown with this movie why he is usually restricted either to the small screen or to supporting roles on the big screen. Walker on the other hand turns in an inspired performance as a rich prep student that is torn between his own morals and conscience and his corrupted father. As said above it is Walker who keeps this second rate 'thriller' above water with his acting skills...there is much more to come from this young talented and budding actor. Walker will be the one who will go on to play leading roles and graduate from the teen movie ranks while Jackson will be left wallowing in Walker's wake. Jackson's acting is one of the many pull downs of this movie. The movie ends with an unbelvievably cheesy scene and it is very irratating for the movie goer as he/she are left with many nagging questions...what happened to Walker's character after his attempted suicide? Not to mention all the holes of the story or the below mediocore acting of most of the cast or the dull directing of Rob Cohen or even the lack of development of any the characters...you barely know enough about any of them to evoke some sympathy. Despite the limitations of his character script and directing Walker rises above all the dismalities of this movie and shines and what makes the movie barely mediocore. The Skulls is just a stepping stone for better things to come for Paul Walker.Natasha Kaplinski... ",3.0
" This film is great trashy fun. Of course it's impossible to take it seriously. Inspired supposedly by Yale's Skulls and Bones the movie has such incredible unbelievable situations that to enjoy it one has to see it as an unintentional comedy. My best scene in that sense would be when Joshua Jackson is interned by the baddies in a madhouse. It's such a ridiculous scene that you can't help laughing at it. The second-best situation would be the duel and the father telling his son after being shot the immortal line 'You're not worth the trouble'. Take it easy and laugh out loud. ",3.0
" This movie reminds me of the kind of movies churned out in the sixties that had mediocre acting mind-numbing plots and hokey production values. But in spite of this 'The Skulls' is an enjoyable film to pass some time with. The plot is interesting in its concept but the execution becomes so absurd that one can only laugh when the two heroes come to a duel with an inevitable conclusion forthcoming. Hill Harper's saintly portrayal of Joshua Jackson's best friend is smarmy; Leslie Bibb and Paul Walker try hard but Mr. Jackson he looks like a high school jock who got cast in the class play because of his looks and touchdowns! William Petersen as the lawyer Skull is an interesting character but tell me---is he supposed to be Jackson's long-lost father? And the ending leaves many questions unanswered. Also Craig T. Nelson's over the top cigar-chomping father is a hoot too!Rent it for fun...it's not a classic but it's not a total flop either! ",3.0
" I ordered this from amazon a few days ago and recieved it today its a fun 'popcorn thriller' although i recall several scenes from the theatre that i didnt find on this DVD version (like when all the new members get there new cars in the theatrical version ther was also a Ducati motorcycle sitting with the cars) this was completely missing from the DVD so there abviously been some cutting.. still a enjoyable film ",3.0
" I remember when I saw this movie in the theater. I was so excited. I think I was like fifteen and while I never watched `Dawson's Creek' I was kind of intrigued by Joshua Jackson (my friends said I looked like him so for some reason I wanted to be him). Walking away from this movie I concluded that 1) Joshua Jackson was my hero 2) Leslie Bibb was all sorts of hot and 3) Paul Walker is an atrocious actor.Joshua Jackson isn't my hero any longer but I still agree with points 2 & 3.This film upon reflection is all sorts of ridiculous but it never ceases to be 100% engaging and entertaining and I could sit down and watch it right now and find it just as effectively engrossing as it was ten year ago. Sure it is heavily (and I mean HEAVILY) flawed but it's a lot of fun and that amounts for a lot.The film follows Luke a poor kid who finds a big opportunity in when he is accepted into the life of the Skulls a secret organization that selects a few Ivy League students to drink from their river of privilege. Even though he is cautioned by his roommate he accepts anyways only to find his roommate dead. All fingers start to point at Luke's Skull `soul mate' Caleb but could it really be that easy?Insert intense drama here.The film is a little all over the place unintentionally campy and ridiculously preposterous but there is an earnestness that helps carry the film to the very end. Joshua Jackson works hard to elevate the film and he manages to do just that most of the time. He is equal parts romantic lead nave victim and commanding hero and he flashes his actor card quite a bit here. I'm actually shocked that Jackson never become a BIG star. I mean he really has the chops. Sure he has a following and has been in a few films and currently resides on television but I really saw big (and I mean BIG) things for him. I'm shocked that Paul Walker (who can't really act to save his life) is the one who walked away from this a star. Even Leslie Bibb faded into obscurity when she is nothing short of stunning here.Thank god she resurfaced in '06 as Ricky Bobby's materialistic wife.If you can look past the films ambitious corn (the initiation sequence alone is laughably trying too hard) and the overall absurdity of the whole thing then you will be richly rewarded with an entertaining and enjoyable thrill ride.Just don't forget to turn your brain back on when the movie is over.

" It's a pretentious story decorated with pseudo-medieval elements about the insides of a secret fraternity - the Skulls. A college graduate (J Jackson) becomes lured in by thousands of bucks suddenly appearing on his account (that he's in a desperate need of to continue his education) gets branded by hot iron on his wrist and has to wear a presented watch to cover the secret mark (how ridiculous - it won't take long to unmask the Skull just take his watch off!). Soon his friend dies mysteriously while trying to penetrate the secret 'temple' of the Skulls (it seems to be in the college cellar but how the heck did they manage to dig out such a big cellar with near temple-high walls?). So Luke understands that life does not give out 'free candies' and faces a simple dilemma.... The finale got my attention for 15 minutes but last pathetic scene garbled the whole impression. Not to mention that as often as not love line of the movie was sacrificed to a quick fumble in the bathroom.Indeed this wasn't a VERY BAD movie at least it tried to make a difference from brain-dead rubbish on eternal problems of how to lose one's virginity win a school beauty contest or escape the next-door maniac. However the Skulls seems to be a group of over-grown tuxedo-addicted post-graduates whose politics besides sponsoring fast canoe rowers (that's Luke) and squander money on posh cars and receptions remain vague. Their initiation was preposterous",3.0
" The Skulls finds us at Yale University which you'll have to assume on your own like I did since they never actually say Yale. We meet Luke who is a self-confessed former menace to society working the cafeteria line and studying hard to make something of himself and hopefully go on to Harvard Law School. The only thing standing in the way of that goal for this young man is the fact that Harvard Law is a teensy weensy bit expensive.Luke along with best friend Will (Hill Harper) and girlfriend Chloe (Leslie Bibb) speculate on his chances to be chosen to join the Skulls a secret society on campus which is rumored to pay for such things as law school bills.It is the secrecy of the society that becomes a rift between Luke and his pals. His buddy Will speculates 'It's secret and it's elite - it can't be good.' Insert ominous music here. By the stroke of midnight on that same eve Luke finds himself in the midst of the Skulls initiation ceremony.The rules that govern the Skulls are grounded in loyalty to the other members a willingness to do anything to protect the other members and keeping the integrity of the Skulls by not divulging any of the proceedings to those on the outside.How can an organization that spawned no less than three U.S. Presidents be bad? Besides you get a kickin' new watch to cover up the Skull logo they brand into your wrist you've got money in your bank account they set you up with a fancy car AND even if you have a girlfriend they've got a couple more for you. Luke McNamara is thinking all this is too good to be true....and he's right it is. It is only at the time of a murder cover-up that Luke begins to realize how corrupt the Skulls are and how high their influence and power runs.Luke is warned by Skulls soulmate Caleb Mandrake (Paul Walker) to back off and not try to dig too deep. Caleb's got a leg-up considering his dad Judge Litton Mandrake (Craig T. Nelson) is the Chairman of the Skulls organization not to mention has designs on the Supreme Court.As you might have guessed The Skulls follows a pretty basic formula with the suspense the wondering who is good and who is bad. Is an elaborate murder plot just another method to fight for control of the society? Who's the pawn and who is the player?The Skulls seems like a watered down version of The Firm. Call it the New Coke of conspiracy movies. Almost but not quite right. Where The Firm made it very clear where the lines were drawn and the penalties for disloyalty were clear with The Skulls there doesn't appear to be anything at stake for the society. They talk about being a member and understanding the virtues of the organization and that the laws of the Skulls are above all other laws but it still rings hollow. The Firm infiltrated the lives of its characters and so does The Skulls but it never explains why. The conflict is room temperature at best.I think they were hoping for a Firm-esque thing here one got that feeling from the previews. I was discussing the possible plot with a friend before having seen it and he was speculating on a sequence that might go something like 'Gee thanks for the Porsche....what's this? I have to drink blood? Ewwww.' Well he was pretty close.BUT. You had to know there was a 'but' in here somewhere. So help me I was entertained. There are days when forgive me I don't want to think too hard. It's sort of comforting sometimes to know that a movie is going to have the appropriately shaky camera shots during the tense scenes and the music will swell ominously at just the precise moment.You know yourself and you know the movies you like. Then there are times hopefully when you allow yourself to sit there and be entertained pure and simple without apologies. On a different day in another frame of mind The Skulls might have really really irritated me. So I gave some but not all of my critical self the day off in a manner of speaking.The acting is OK it compliments the New Coke attitude of the script. Joshua Jackson is likable and Paul Walker is moderately interesting as the spoiled heir-to-the-throne Caleb. You get to see Craig T. Nelson as a mean creepy guy instead of the bumbling confused Coach character you see now on reruns. The most interesting performance is that of William Petersen who plays a U.S. Senator that is in the Skulls organization.The camera work is predictable but still fun. The soundtrack is pretty cool which is sometimes the only reason movies like this aren't immediately forgotten. However there is nothing riveting or conflicting enough to keep you glued to your seat.You know what you like. Sometimes you're in the mood for something different. Sometimes you're in the mood for something ridiculous in the hopes of being entertained. ",3.0
" In the dark halls once walked by ancient members of secret societies one group in particular stands out and has survived and prospered...The Skulls. This opening introduction should have been a clue as to how absurdly dramatic this movie would be.Director Rob Cohen (Daylight Fast & The Furious) has never been able to pull any gem from the movies he makes with the only exception being Dragon The Bruce Lee Story. Instead he usually creates moderately entertaining movies that try so hard to be more than they are. This was the last dramatic movie he made before moving into the even more flashy flair of The Fast & The Furious.The Skulls starts out promising with good characters trying to deal with their real life and school. One in particular Lucas McNamara played by Joshua Jackson of Dawson's Creek fame is trying hard to make something of himself despite his poor roots and semi-criminal childhood. He does well but mostly plays a similar character to what he played on DC. Paul Walker playing Caleb Mandrake stands out showing some real emotion as the conflicted rich kid who befriends Lucas and battles his own conscious throughout the movie. You find yourself liking him despite his `take no responsibility' personality.The real downfall of the movie is simply the switch in direction from Lucas' journey into sudden wealth and opportunity to murder mystery. I think it would have been more instresting to see Lucas work his way into the society and find he is nothing like these people and either find a way to use the Skulls abilities for good purposes. William L. Peterson always good plays Senator Levritt who states this to Lucas early in the movie. This sounded like a promising start to the intrigue that could follow the young man who has never known what it's like to be rich or to have the ability to wield such power.But alas the movie falls into bleak territory and barely digs it's way out. All in all it's an entertaining movie of power secret society rules superceding the law and discovery of a person's own moral code. A good combination that was clumsily executed but is still good on most levels. ",3.0
" I rented this film hoping to learn more about the secret society Skull and Bones (or just Skulls for this film). We don't get to see much other than some lame initiation rite and a brief ballroom dance party where beautiful ladies are merely there for the decoration as they are introduced to the new initiates. What follows is a second rate formula film to unravel the mystery of who's behind the coverup of the murder in the Skulls ritual room. I was nearly bored to tears. The only good things about this film were the music and the scene when Joshua Jackson's character flips out accusing a police officer of switching the videotape to cover up the conspiracy. He did a great job in that scene but the rest of the film seriously needed some work. After I finished watching it I felt like the makers of this movie didn't know enough about the Skulls to really write and produce a stellar movie. I wanted to learn more about what a membership in Skulls means to people besides having beautiful women thrown at them sports cars of their dreams and $100000 checks made out to each member once they are officially part of the brotherhood. I wanted to know more about the tension between Mandrake and the Senator as well as Mandrake and his own son. This film just glosses over it to move the plot along and what you get is a snoozefest with marginal acting and story. If anything this film does a service to secret societies because people will walk away after viewing this film that there's nothing to worry about if members of our government and Wall Street are in the brotherhood. I hope a more serious film about the social impact of secret societies and its rituals will be made someday and that such a script/story won't be sacrificed for the purpose of fitting the standard formula of the suspense drama. Skulls could have used a lot more suspense. Because of the mediocrity of this film I won't even bother to watch any of its sequels. If it couldn't be done right the first time there's no point in repeating the same formula with different casts. ",3.0

" BALLPARK BLUES opens with a prologue in which we find thirty year old sportswriter Russell Bryant covering an NCAA Division III baseball game for the NEW YORK TIMES. A baseball scout tells Russ to keep an eye on Rhode Island College's catcher Casey Fox.As life would have it Russ is prematurely on his way down the professional ladder. When Chapter One begins he has lost his job at THE TIMES and is now working for the PROVIDENCE DAILY JOURNAL. By contrast Casey is on his way up the professional ladder and is found playing for the Boston Red Sox's Triple A Farm Team Pawtucket. Russ is a cynical but not unwise young man who this reader liked immediately and grew to love by book's end. Casey on the other hand is a troubled but immensely talented young man who this reader disliked immediately and came to hate by book's end.A tentative unlikely friendship buds between them as each struggles 'to find his place in the world' and to discern how he might best live his life. The 'coming of age' and 'spiritual journey' story disguised as a baseball book was a cliche long before C.W. Tooke wrote this one; and it has been done to greater effect by a number of writers.This is Tooke's first novel and he made a few freshmen mistakes. The most egregious of which is imbuing both his main characters with virtues and abilities beyond their respective years. Tooke might be forgiven for his fantasy had it remained benign. However it is difficult to maintain a consistently believable narrative if the more fantastic elements of the story trump the book's overarching theme and that is what happens here.Despite the wit and humor of Tooke's narrator the story is ultimately just silly. BALLPARK BLUES is readable but not notable. As a first novel I would say that it is 'average.' C.W. Tooke did not hit a homerun in this his first 'at-bat.' No 'Rookie of the Year Honors' for this one but maybe the kid has a future. ",3.0
" Although the list of quality of adult baseball fiction is regrettably short I really thought this might have have a chance. It starts out quite well- phenom disaffected writer and his conscience and has some humor to it but it runs out of steam in the second half of the book with a lot of pontificating and self rightous indignation.Most unfortunotely there is the inevitable 'BIG GAME'. Why must every baseball fiction writer use the same cliche? Still in all it's better than most and certainly worth a read ",3.0

" For women with fuller busts this bra is great...but only for a little while. The company recently switched to metal clasps on all except the black to hold the straps because they were getting too many complaints about the plastic ones breaking...which happened to me at work. There really isn't a risk of the metal ones breaking but the straps have a tendency to slide through the clasps just after wearing it a few times. Your strap won't break but you won't feel secure when your breasts are inching down with every little movement you make. Until they find a better clasp I will have to look elsewhere for support. ",3.0
" I purchased this bra during a few months in which I was temporarily off of birth control due to needing to renew but waiting for the insurance from the new job to kick in. I was experiencing extreme breast tenderness during ovulation and menstruation to the point that I would go to the bathroom at work and cut the wires out of my nice expensive bras. I decided to purchase a wireless bra for those days so that I could experience some semblance of comfort.When the bra arrived I tried it on and it fit. It supported fairly well. I love that the straps lock into place and don't slide longer as it's worn. However it bears a terrible resemblance to the bullet bras of my grandma's era which is not a look that I prefer. I also have terrible problems with wireless bras not giving me enough separation causing my breasts to touch sweat and chafe regardless of weather/climate control conditions however most of this can be solved by applying deodorant or baby powder. The strap padding is more annoying than effective as it slides around and constantly needs adjustment. If there were a way to hook or fasten it into place that would be ideal.I do like that there are four columns of hooks as the standard three tend to stretch out far to quickly for my taste leading to me taking in the sides or back of my bras - I prefer the bands tight for if I don't have ample support my back lets me know in very unpleasant terms. This bra however does not feel like it will be stretching out at any point in the near future as the fabric has very little elastic.This has been designated to be an at-home-only bra due to the shape and I doubt I'll ever wear it in public. I'm to the point of not caring about seams or trim showing through my top provided the bra does its job of making my boobs round lifted and front and center however this fails on all but lifted. It's perfect if I'm sick cleaning or lounging or if I'll be going somewhere that evening in constrictive undergarments but prefer to be comfortable until it's necessary to change.If the shaper were better I may consider purchasing this bra again however as it is I will not be purchasing another one as I have found an alternate comfy bra that doesn't mis-shape me terribly. Being that I'm now on Implanon I don't have to worry about ovulation OR periods however it's nice to take a break from wires and side boning on occasion. ",3.0
" I decided to try this bra based on my own research indicating it was one of the best wire-free bras available. I work at home and was looking for a less expensive option than my go-to bra (Elomi Energise). Although the Elila is expensive too the price here was reasonable so I decided to give it a try.The support is good. It definitely reminds me of bras that my grandma would wear with that odd pointy shape that it squashes your boobs into. However this is a wire-free bra so I knew that would be the case going into it. Since I was just getting it primarily to wear around the house I was not that concerned.I could not get past the itchy unpleasant feel of the fabric. I would have returned but I had already removed the tags and washed it since that usually helps to soften the fabric. I'm sure if I wore it more frequently it would soften but it felt like torture to me so I haven't been able to do that. However I am extremely sensitive to the feel of the fabric. I have Glamorise bras as well and while they are itchy to start out as well I think they are more comfortable in general (and a more reasonable price).But again the support was good. If you are looking for a wire-free bra that is very supportive and don't mind the shape that this gives you and are okay with breaking in the itchy firm fabric then I think you would be happy with this product. For me I will be investing in the Elomi Energise bra which does have a wire but is ridiculously comfortable flexes with me and has a nice smooth fabric that is not itchy. ",3.0

" JK Rowling's Book Four was as fabulous as all the rest unfortunately the film version turned out a great deal of choppy editing and some personal scenes that were so deeply compressed that we rarely had a chance to enjoy them before they were gone. The extra scenes provided on disk two add background and texture particularly when Alan Rickman (Snape) is present.Emma Watson is a wonderful actress and the Yule Ball gave her a chance to shine...but... it seemed to me that as Hermione her pitch rarely varied mostly shrill and shrill (believe me I love the actress but I know she has a greater range than what appeared on screen). Fortunately we were saved by the time that was given to the Weasley twins by Miranda Richardson's artfully wicked portrayal of Rita Skeeter and by Rupert Grint's (Ron Weasley's) comedic flair. Other highlights via actor Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) were the bubble bath egg sequence as well as the dramatic closing scenes with Harry's enemy Lord Voldemort.To the Director of Film Five...Enough money has already been made that you can successfully convince the studio to extend the time of the next film to at least three hours. If someone thinks that the audience can not sit through three hours then they don't understand their audience. Come on give the next film the time that it deserves and listen to the screenwriter..work together to give us scenes that have not only the excitement required but the small moments between friends that are full and complete.'Return of the King' the third theatrical installment of the Tolkien trilogy was taken from a book of 512 pages. The film a total of 3 hours and 10 minutes garnished many Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director. Described by the entertainment industry's big mag Variety as an 'urgently paced 200-minute film without an ounce of fat' the film proved that most theater goers were happy to sit in their seats for three hours.One last thing please I beg you more light. Dark and darker is unnecessary and boring. It isn't dark that's better it's the contrast between light and dark that's better. Please don't make me feel like I'm watching an unlit version of MTV.

The movie might appeal to pre-teens because of the heavy focus on relationships between the characters but the rest of us will just feel excluded. ",3.0

" It's like someone tore a hole in the movie. So much is missing. I was looking forward to ***spoiler alert*** Dudley with his tongue at 4 feet Weasley's Wizard Wheezes S.P.E.W Ludo Bagman The Quidditch World Cup the Sphinx. They made a whole bunch of other scenes longer so long that it was unnecessary. For example the dragon? Perhaps they just made that scene longer for excitement but really I think they should have cut those short and added some much needed other scenes.I have to admit the special effects were great and they looked very realistic. I know it must have been hard to squeeze in all those events in a mere 2 hours and a half but in my opinion I think they could've done better.

Whomever wrote in their review that they are not is not paying very much attention. The actors have not changed no one complained about that.

" I usually don't review HP movies because I'm one of those people who always whines about things that they left out and changed and blah blah blah no one cares. But I'm reviewing this one because I think it was the best one so far... yet it still had a ton of wasted potential.First off all of the stupid stuff was kept in this movie and all of the important stuff was left out. Stupid stuff being things like the Yule Ball--in the book it at least had relationship development and the revelation that Hagrid is half giant but here it was just such a pointless laughably lame scene. Important stuff being like the whole thing with racism Neville's parents the fact that Harry can fight off the Imperius Curse the Ministry's not believing Voldemort's come back... and especially the lack of explanation of Priori Incantatem. I feel sorry for people who haven't read the book as that must have been extremely confusing.Another thing is characterization. People have already pointed out Dumbledore being the opposite of what Dumbledore should be and I agree. All of the Champions' personalities were either changed (Krum Cedric) or not there (Fleur.) The biggest difference however is Hermione. Hermione of the book would NEVER say 'Viktor is more of a... physical being.' I'm not sure if I should blame the script or Emma Watson's bad acting.. I think I'll go with both.Allow me to digress on that for a moment... that whole 'RONALD! YOU RUINED EVERYTHING!' part where she utterly shrieks was just horrible. And what was up with her crying during the Unforgivable Curses lesson? She doesn't know Neville's past. Daniel Radcliffe also did a poor job acting but I'm used to that. I'm hoping he'll be more in his element in five when Harry is required to be more angsty. Rupert Grint is the best actor of the bunch but per usual Ron's shoved aside in favor of Hermione. We have no explanation for Ron's getting mad at Harry so it feels like it comes completely out of nowhere and thus while Grint does a good job it just comes off as pouty. I seriously have to wonder if the scriptwriters just don't like him or somethingAnyway what was the worst about this movie however was its complete disregard of my intelligence. The Deatheaters are like the KKK? REALLY? Oh my GOD I never would have figured that out if they hadn't made them wear the KKK-ish costumes! And what was up with the SMACKING US OVER THE HEAD with the fact that Moody was Crouch Jr.? So much for that brilliant plot twist! They also made Crouch Jr. into as my friend said a Scooby Doo villain. The whole thing about his relationship with his father is gone. He's just another two-dimensional cackling villain. I'm also supposed to believe that Sirius would sign his letters as 'Sirius' even though he's a wanted criminal. Riiight.One gigantic plus however was Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort. Oh man that was the best part. His eyes literally pierced you! Amazing. Also Katie Leung was a very adorable Cho Chang. And Bonnie Wright is really becoming a lovely young woman; her scene with Neville was so adorable that for a moment I regretted that JKR said they were only friends. And kudos to the guy who plays Neville... he was fantastic. Almost had me crying during the Unforgivable Curses scene.Overall... it was for me the most entertaining HP movie",3.0
" I won't write a synopsis I'm sure there will be hundreds of people who will after this review.My family and I all love the Harry potter stories. They are rich and enjoyable. I find myself anticipating the release of Deathly Hallows. But the movies I'm sad to say have recently been lacking and that continues with this one. It seemed to begin with Prisoner of Azkaban. After watching the interviews and discovering how Cuaron cheated by having the kids write essays on their characters instead of reading the book I was very disappointed and the butchery of the story for the sake of time and 'Hollywood' THEN made sense. They seem to be leaving things out important things to the story. What happened to SPEW? What happened to Hermione knitting hats? These things may not have seemed important to the over all story as portrayed in the movie but these little touches add depth and colour to the world of Harry Potter. they could have shortened the battle with the dragon in Goblet perhaps put in a couple of two or three minute spots about SPEW but they chose to go for the action instead of the human touches to these stories. My daughter plans to take me to see Order of The Phoenix for my birthday. And I'm sad to say I'm only partially looking forward to it at this point I keep hoping that they will pull it back together.What makes this movie worth while? Not much.

" Goblet of Fire is definitely the worst of the Harry Potter movie series as many viewers have noted. Hopefully this will be the last error of this magnitude in the movie versions of the fantastic books. When young actors are growing up as fast as these are you really can't afford to make mistakes like this movie. Any later attempt to fill in the missing pieces can only be awkward at best. One actor said in one of those pre-release tv info-mercials that there was enough in the book for two movies. I agree and they should have made two or even three movies to keep the storyline. For those of us who read the books it is extremely difficult to see how anyone can even attempt to make movies of the following books with all the basic information that is missing from this movie. When I played the unabridged audio books for some friends of mine they were dumbfounded at all that is missing. ",3.0

The Lord of the Rings movies are a wonderful example of the right way to take a long detailed story and turn it into a captivating film that captures the spirit of the book. That is my main complaint about this (and the other 3) Harry Potter movies. The spirit of the book -- the sense of magic and wonder -- is not there.Another small complaint I have is that the movie seems to made for those of us who have read the book.

Don't get me wrong. The actors and actresses were and are fantastic as always. I applaud them. I have no qualms about their acting capabilities. They are fabulous. But why wasn't it exciting enough for me because the movie was an hour and 57 minutes long and the excitement didn't come until the last 30 minutes of the movie. That means that it was an hour and 27 minutes of boredom. It didn't have that spark that was in the first three movies. I hope that the next movie The Half-Blood Prince is much much better. And the only way for the next movie to have more spark is to get a Director who can administer that spark that excitement. ",3.0
" I generally try to focus on the movie itself without reference to the book it was based upon but I had a hard time with this one. The Goblet of Fire was possibly my favorite book in the series and I looked forward to this movie a lot. In itself the movie was enjoyable but I left the theater angry. The writers and directors clearly had to condense the story line and that's totally understandable. What totally ticked me off was that they cut out important scenes from the book in order to put a lot of 'Hollywood' scenes in their place. The dancing lesson didn't exist in the book but it was funny. And it took up valuable time in an already long movie. The dragon scene could have been half as long but I guess that is more exciting than the real drama of the story. The scene which absolutely angered me was a non-scene. They took the time at the beginning of the movie to show Moody's foe glass which shows when his enemies are drawing near. It was a key element of foreshadowing in the book and should have been in the movie but they forgot to add the follow-up at the end of the movie! Why foreshadow something if you're not going to refer to it again later on?? Again a waste of valuable time.I could look over the total lack of certain characters from the book because it didn't really bother me. But it leaves out key information. I happened to go with somebody who had never read the book and he couldn't begin to understand some of the story lines. We are left hanging at the end of the movie. They don't bother to explain how Barty Crouch escaped from Azkaban and assumed Moody's identity they completely left out that the Ministry 'finished off' Crouch before they could find out the truth of Voldemort's return and they didn't bother to point out that the Minister refused to believe that Voldemort did indeed return. Maybe not such a big deal for a movie but for a movie with a definite sequel that's a key teaser right there!! I thought putting a teaser at the end of the first movie is a good prompter to see the following one.In all I am afraid I couldn't get past the errors of omission. It was a disappointment for me as a fan of the series but it was also a disappointment as a general movie-goer who is left hanging at the end with a lot of unanswered questions. ",3.0

Ludo Bagman was also omitted. The characters of the other TriWizard champions Fleur and Viktor were so under developed that you could not particularly care what happened to them during the course of this ill-directed movie. I really miss Chris Columbus. Mike Newell does a terrible job here. He decided it was a good idea to film everything in the dark.

All of these problems could have easily been addressed with a few sentences of dialogue but because they weren't ... the movie won't be able to stand on its own through time.The Goblet of Fire didn't expand and capitalize on some of its amazing footage. I wanted to see more of the Quidditch match and more of the phenomenal stadium that was generated for it in the beginning of the movie. Instead of being amazed I felt cheated. A few seconds longer would have been alot more satisfying.A few seconds longer would be an improvement just about anywhere in the movie. Cliff notes would have done a better job condensing the book. The movie was way too short for the ground it attempted to cover. There was no character developement at all.All in all for those of us who know what is going on it is a lavish production very richly done. There are some fantastic CGI scenes with the dragon as well as the arrival of the guest Academies. Again in my opinion not long enough.Goblet of Fire book is my favorite of the series...as it is for many. The volume had the greatest potential of becoming the 'signature flick' of the Potter franchise to be viewed again and again over generations to come. Alas!...it is not to be with so many holes in the story...the movie should be renamed 'Harry Potter and the Leaky Cauldron of Fire'.MJH ",3.0
" I am a huge fan of both the series of Harry Potter books & movies. I own everything released to date and have rewatched and reread countless times... But I'm not sure I will rewatch this one very much. The actors gave great performances (although I have to say Ralph Fiennes' portrayal of Voldemort was nowhere near what I expected. I also found Michael Gambon's performance as Dumbledore to be out of character)and the special effect are amazing. But I find this movie to be rushed and shallow. I can only hope Order of the Phoenix will be better. ",3.0
" Not having been able to see this movie on the big screen I ran right out and got The Goblet of Fire and watched it right away. Thanks to the comments of a like-minded friend who had seen it in November and my own cognitive abilities I did not have high expectations but I confess I was still a bit disappointed. This was the first HP movie that really felt like it was being marketed to a certain age group (preteen-teen) and it had none of the artistry or of the continuity of the storyline of The Prisoner of Azkaban. The movie used cliches--scary hallways poor lighting everyone (at Hogwarts anyway) dressed in black etc.--so instead of feeling fresh it just fell flat for me.Usually I love Patrick Doyle's music (he did Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility) but here I missed the pizzazz of John Williams's scores. In another comparison with the earlier three movies I'd have to say the brevity of Alan Rickman's part of Professor Snape was yet another feature that made HP4 fall short of being a movie that I will watch again and again. I have yet to watch the deleted scenes which I am hoping will flesh out the story a bit more but the whole movie felt like it was chopped to bits in the editing room.How the heck is Warner Bros. going to make a 2.5- or even 3-hour movie work for Order of the Phoenix? I would hope they get Alfonso Cuaron back for that one or find someone else of his caliber. Good luck Steven Kloves (screenwriter)--I cannot even imagine the Herculean task of manipulating such a long and involved story into a cohesive screenplay. Perhaps Warner Bros. could consider begetting the biggest TV event in history and turn HP5 into a six-plus hour miniseries a la the BBC's Pride & Prejudice?If I could have done I would have given the movie two and a half stars but I erred on the generous side as that option is not available. It is still somewhat enjoyable to 'catch up' with the characters as they race through another year at Hogwarts but (to fall back on a cliche myself) the book is so much better. ",3.0
" While the first two films were cut to the point of losing depth of character they still remained true to the spirit of the story. This film was butchered to the point of a one note song that was simply boring. After awhile you just adapt out to the heavy dark mood that has none of the Harry Potter spirit. There is no humor. There is no strength to the characters and Dumbledoor is so off key it is painful. Much of the story is changed to the point of losing meaning. I suppose all the budget and time was spent on special effects (also what took away from the third film Prisoner of Azkaban). I had hoped that in the Prisoner of Azkaban the Bluray version might be extended so that it did not feel so cut (it did not) but even extending this film would not have done anything to improve it. I understand a director wanting to put their mark on a film but this was not the mark to have left.It is a fine Disney or Warner Brother's type film to enjoy which is why I gave it 3stars. It is not worthy of the book. ",3.0

" Having read all of the books so far (& re-read them) I was suprised of the amount of changes in the book to film adaptation. Though I'm used to seeing books not done well by screen writers I was really quite shocked how much they cut up the book. Omitting rather important characters is screwing up the plot developement. Many things go unexplained & do not make sense please JKR if you have any input get after them about this in future films!!! The special effects as a whole were good & the ending was in tune with the darkness the books as a whole are heading. I did miss the well known theme music. I hope JKR will take a more hands on role in at least the last 2 films or the whole set will not be done well. ",3.0
" The film gets credit for trying to cram a large richly detailed book into two and a half hours and making a fair attempt to follow the book at the same time. It of course cuts out large parts of the book alters others and oddly slipping in scenes that weren't in the book at all possibly because there was no need for the two visiting schools to enter the Great Hall performing interpretive dance. It could have also done without the five or six sweeping aerial shots of Hogwarts usually following the tail of an owl whose purpose seems mainly to take up time and show viewers where the film budget went.However much effort the director might have put into this film the book remains infinitely better not least because of the treatment of Dumbledore. In the book Dumbledore is calm collected reserved and above all seems to know everything. He's the person you can always count on to be there in a crisis or to explain things in the end. In this film Dumbledore is uncharacteristically weak unnerved shaken moody and oddly violent. After Harry's name comes out of the goblet of fire the book has Dumbledore calmly approaching Harry and asking him if he had put his name in the goblet. In the movie Dumbledore runs into the room grabs Harry practically slams him against a table and shouts 'DID YOU DO THIS HARRY!?! DID YOU PUT YOUR NAME IN THE GOBLET?!? DID YOU HAVE ANOTHER STUDENT DO IT FOR YOU?!?! ANSWER ME!!' Dumbledore fights with Fudge slumps and bungles. I'm not sure why but his seems to be the only character to have suffered such a severe alteration. Dumbledore was old but as pointed out several times in the book he didn't act like it.In addition the film turns what was an unavoidable complication letting underage Harry compete because the goblet chose him to compete into a conspiracy to capture who put his name in something not in the book and certainly not needed. The film also suffers from the usual Hollywood excess when it comes to special effects. In addition to the overzealous shots of owls and the expanding zoom shots of the exterior of the Triwizard stadium (which was supposed to be on the Hogwarts Quidditch field not removed to the side of a mountain) there was the almost nauseating portkey sequence in the beginning when what should have been a simple flash and they find themselves elsewhere becomes a scene out of Star Trek where they go flying through the air and into a wormhole-like thing that leaves them flying through the air again and plummeting to the ground. Okay. Don't know what purpose that served.And even more annoying was the excessive time spent butchering the first task where Harry and the others fight dragons. In the book the dragons were nesting mothers would who be protecting their eggs one of which was the golden egg the champions would have to steal. In the film there was just this egg sitting amongst the rocks and nothing was keeping the dragons from either eating the children or ignoring the egg (unlike with a nesting mother whose priority would be protecting the eggs) which seems really stupid for a tournament where no one was supposed to die. And not only that but when Harry fights his dragon it wasn't a few scenes of him flying around the nesting mother who wouldn't leave her eggs; it was a long drawn out scene where the dragon escapes Harry flies out of the stadium all together and gets chased around Hogwarts dangles off the side of towers mangles roofs and of course loses the dragon somewhere around the castle and for all appearances it might still be there because you don't see it return or get captured. In the book they mention dragon handlers would be standing by in the event 'things got out of hand.' I think the dragon escaping and chasing a fourteen year old kid around in an attempt to kill him is 'out of hand' but no one not the professors not the dragon handlers not even Hagrid did anything. They just sat there.This is just one tiny plot hole though next to what was left out at the end. Barty Crouch of the Ministry a poorly developed character to begin with died seemingly without cause just being found dead and nothing more being said about that. Barty Crouch Jr. who was posing as Mad-Eye Moody throughout the film was left without an ending. Was he taken to Azkaban did Fudge have his soul sucked out by a dementor like in the book did he get away? The scene just jumps to a very tired Dumbledore giving a half-hearted speech to students about Cedric's death. Also left out is the fact that Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge was now opposed to Dumbledore and his crusade to tell people about Voldemort's return and was mentioned only in passing when Dumbledore says 'The Minster of Magic doesn't want me to tell you this...' Why? Well maybe you just are expected to have read the book.Another problem although this might just be me was Voldemort. No offense to Ralph Fiennes I know he's a good actor but his scenes all seem so rushed he's practically treading over all his lines to cram them into the tiny space allotted for them. And I don't know about anyone else but when you first see the darkest wizard to grace the wizarding world you're first thought should not be 'I thought he'd be taller.'Over all though the film does has its moments. But it's best if you don't do what I did which was reread the book right before watching it. It does stay pretty close to the story the characters are all well cast and except for Dumbledore are good portrayals of the characters. The one major flaw is the fact that there needs to be more Fred and George. These two on their own would make the film worth watching. ",3.0
" First off I thought this movie was quite entertaining and exciting in a thrill-ride sort of way but it was the weakest film in the Harry Potter series. Many people will disagree with me but this film lacked in plot and character development. The Triwizard champions had a total of two or less lines in the movie and they weren't shown enough to grow accustomed to them. Mike Newell might be a great director but he didn't capture the mood and essence of the Harry Potter world. Every time I was getting ready to settle with a situation or conflict the movie took me to an entirely different ball park. The film never settled... it was in a constant rush.Before the movie premiered in theaters I remember hearing Newell say in an interview that he took out a few unnecessary subplots. He definitely took out many unnecessary subplots and he replaced them with some other unnecessary scenes. There was a part in the movie where 'Karkaroff' (The Durmstrang Headmaster)is shown secretly entering the lonely Great Hall. It's a very suspicious scene that leaves the audience wondering",3.0
" Someone who simply loves Harry Potter the books and the films in other words someone who stays one saving step away from fandom inevitably must have noticed that 'true' Potter fans are an exceptionally tough folk to please; at least when it comes to the film adaptions of their beloved novels.After 'Prisoner Of Azkaban' many fans complained about the movie. Too many changes too much left out and so on and so forth. Now just as fans demanded director Mike Newell and Potter veteran Steve Kloves (screenplay) created something that is the opposite of that; not too many changes and desperate tries to cram as much into 'Goblet Of Fire' as possible. Consequently this film lacks coherence good pacing and vividly drawn characters. So bitching Potter afficiandos watch it and be quiet this is what you've cried for!And you've cried for it because you've missed one maybe the crucial point",3.0
" I've always felt that this space should be used to review the specific product features of the DVD itself and not the film. Go to the IMDB for treatment of the films content plot etc. This is about what Warner Bros did to put the film on the DVD.That said I'm dissapointed. If you pull out all 4 dvd release and compare them you see that they are getting cheaper and you get less for the purchase with each one. While films 1 and 2 had cardboard boxes and inserts movie 3 lost the cardboard box ( a small thing and some may say an improvement) and now the 4th film lost all inserts as well. (I purchased my copy of the 2 disc kit from Wal-Mart).THe lack of any insert is really sad. A graphical depiction of whats where on the 2 disc dvd as was provided with film 3 and many other 'extended multi-disc' releases really is essential.

" I wish I had a dollar every time Ron Weasley (Rupert Gint) says 'Bloody Hell!' in Goblet of Fire. There is some sexual innuendo as well that was completely absent in the three preceding films. It is like the director is trying to mature the audience - make them more grown-up - to prepare them for the dark turn the franchise is taking.The story takes place as fourth-year Harry has his name mysteriously entered in the Tri-Wizard Tournament a dangerous magic Olympics between three schools of magic. Romance ensues as the stalwart Victor Krum pursues Hermione and Harry has a huge crush on Cho Chang a fellow Hogwart's student. Not to mention Hagrid is sweet on the headmistress of Beaux Baton School of Magic for Girls. Harry is haunted by a recurring dream about Lord Voldemort. The World Cup of Quidditch also takes place where Voldemort's supporters make a terrifying appearance.Nevertheless Goblet of Fire is vastly entertaining with astounding special effects. Very magical atmosphere with the real terror held off towards the end. Two deaths in the film are sobering. ",3.0

" Making a great book into a great movie is very challenging. The toughest thing being having to out do the imagination of both the author and the reader. Peter Jackson did it in the first two 'Lord of the rings' films before it all fell apart in the finale (But then again so too did the third book) but so far the Potter films are basically 0-3-1.GOF is the best of the Potter novels IMO and now the best of the Potter films. That's not saying much however. The other movies well intentioned and slick as they are are rather dull and flat translations of their written counterparts. The kids look like how the characters are described. The world looks like it should (Aside from the sometimes dodgy CGI) But for some reason the films lack the charm heart and wonder of Rowling's novels.GOF is not so much a giant leap but a small step forward. At times it's even mildly thrilling but I challenge any true Potter fan to say that they've managed to capture the books properly on film.The extras here are mostly kid stuff (Appropriately so) It basically plays like promotional material for a film you already own.All in all GOF would be just another forgettable kiddie adventure film if not for it's source material. My advice for true Potter fans... Skip the movies and re-read the books. ",3.0
" For the first time ever I was NOT entertained by a Harry Potter movie. Something was seriously wrong with the entire thing. I remember the happy look on my face when I found out that HBO would be airing Goblet of Fire in late November. I waited patiently for the new Harry Potter film like a snake in the grass. Just the magical atmosphere of the previous three Potter movies made me want to crave another one and crave it BADLY. Turns out I was surprisingly disappointed with it.I hated that the first 45 minutes really didn't do much in the way of keeping my interest. I thought that whole portion of the film was pointless. It was like they were trying to recapture the mysterious atmosphere from Chamber of Secrets but not so interesting the second time because we've already seen it before and done MUCH better then.Another crappy part of the plotline- Harry Potter goes to dancing class with his friends. I'm not kidding. Why would anyone find this interesting? It was a waste of time. To make matters worse a fairly lengthy amount of time was devoted to it. Just silly.Look I LOVED the previous three Harry Potter movies but this one just didn't do anything for me. It was like the writers have finally run out of ideas and the feeling I got was that the only reason this movie exists is to either make more money or probably more realistically the writers wanted to give hardcore Potter fans more storyline and top-notch production to cheer about. Hey I can't blame them for that.Harry Potter fans love the books and the movies. We know this from experience by the way people stand outside at midnight waiting for either the new book to be released or the new movie to be shown. So if the fans are happy with this film good for them. I sure wasn't. To me Goblet of Fire had a 'been there done that' vibe and I simply can't look at it any other way unfortunately.To sum up this disappointing film- a few interesting action scenes (one exciting memorable scene in particular was Harry challenging a giant flying bird thing- sorry I don't know what you're supposed to call the darn creature) in between a LOT of unnecessary dialogue that apparently is only interesting if you happen to be a REALLY big Harry Potter fan. For the people out there reading who just *enjoy* the Potter films but aren't obsessed- stick with the previous three.(updated thoughts- January 2 2007)-Okay watching the movie a second time (which seems to be necessary I apologize) I actually really like the movie after all. I give it a rating of 4 out of 5. The segments I originally thought dragged were actually pretty good. They WERE telling a good story here after all it just wasn't obvious I guess. The action scenes were pretty spectacular as well. Harry Potter is just getting older and becoming an adult that's probably why I hated it at first. I didn't really care for the whole dancing plot in the middle of the movie (which was about 15 boring minutes long) but that's the only serious complaint. ",3.0
" You're probaby thinking is this kid nuts for rating this awesome movie three stars? No I'm not crazy because it's true. Warner Brothers has done it again taking a excellent book by J. K. Rowling and making a crappy movie out of it. I read the Harry Potter books and I was disappointed with this movie. They cut out the Dursleys Hermione's petition against having House Elves Winky(Barty Couch's house elf) a certain beetle(read the last chapter where Hermione is clutching a jar with a beetle in it) and a death that should have taken place. They honestly could have done better with this movie. I have the first three movies. I love the first two but once you get to Prisoner of Azkaban the magic begins to crumble. So if I were you I would only get the movie because of Voldemort(He Who Must Not Be Named). He was the best thing that came out of this movie.Rock On!! ",3.0

" Now I'm a hudge Harry Potter fan it was the first series that I would actually read 100% willingly. Also as i read all these other reviews most dont give both sides they just say how it was such a good movie and to an extent it was but I was sadly disapointed in this movieThe movie was first of all to consecutive it started off with alot of action and didnt slow down it had the feeling of just wanting to hit the main points in the book and not have feeling to it. This reduced its abuility of being a good movie if one looks at all the great movies in the world one would see that they are always full of emotion.Second the over all movie did'nt stay as true to the book as I would have liked. First of all they left out Bagmen. Who played a decent role in the plot and was a rather entertaining character was completely left out. This changed the story slightly though not much so it can be excused.Third they left out Doby the house elf (insedentaly one of my more favorable characters)this changed the plot in the movie a little more than Bagmen. But this in turn leaves out the house elf Winky. Which in turn leaves out S.P.E.W (this in the book gave depth to Hermione's character). But I can understand why they left it out.However on the other hand it was a very well done movie and the visual effects were quite good along with the acting and the writers didnt mess with it so much that the story didnt make sense.I would definatly say go see it.I hope that this review was helfull to you all ",3.0

" ***1/2In 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' the fourth installment in the perennially popular series by J. K. Rowling the young wizards seem to have a bit more on their minds than just flying around on broomsticks and casting spells. For along with puberty come activated hormones and a sudden burgeoning interest in the opposite sex. This brings a nice grown-up dimension to a series that continues to enchant young and old alike with its constantly renewing creativity and imagination.All however is not puppy love romance and fancy dress balls for there is still the serious business of wizardry to be done at Hogwarts Academy. In this edition Harry is compelled to take part in the Tri-Wizard Tournament a sort of Olympic Games for magicians that is so intense that it has resulted in the deaths of a few of the participants in the past. In order to win the prize of the goblet of fire the contestant must face three challenges - a battle with dragons an underwater rescue of some kidnapped friends and a trip through an elaborate maze with the goal in each case being the capturing of a mysterious giant egg. At the base of the contest lies the evil Lord Voldemort (a creepy Ralph Fiennes) who is as always trying to eliminate young Mr. Potter by any means necessary.Although a bit long at two hours and thirty-six minutes 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' still manages to breathe new life into a franchise that should by all rights be turning pretty stale by now. It does so partly through some really fine set pieces - i.e. the challenges - partly through the high flying imaginativeness of so much of the storyline partly through the endearing relationships among the various characters and partly through the performance of Daniel Radcliffe who keeps Harry Potter lifelike compelling and interesting as an everyman hero. The tone is also remarkably dark in the later stretches of the film as is befitting the advancing ages of the characters although very young children might find some of the scenes a trifle disturbing so be forewarned.Filled with beautiful images and dazzling special effects 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' is another worthy addition to a series that is fast becoming a modern day classic in its own right.

" I just finished reading the Goblet of Fire and I went immediately to the video store to see if the DVD held up to the book. The book was amazing out of this world and the best Harry Potter I've read so far. THE BOOK DESERVES FIVE STARS. However the cinematic adaptation left me amazed by the special effects but also deeply disappointed. I KNOW that it's impossible to adapt 730 pages into a 2 hour movie. I'm not asking for the moon but I think the director left out some really important details that really let me down.*There were no house elves in the movie! Dobby gave Harry the gillweed NOT Neville.*The first task with the dragons just wasn't real at all. In the book Harry concentrates on learning the summon spell to attract his broom and that's his main strategy. In the movie it looks like it occurred to him at the last moment and then that chase over Hogwarts just didn't happen in the book.*The third task the labyrinth was clearly the weakest part of the movie! What a downer! We didn't really see any obstacles... Where was the Boggart (in Dementor form) the Blast-Ended Skrewt and how about the Sphinx to get by and then the spider at the end?... Cedric and Harry fought the spider together and Harry stunned Victor NOT Cedric. The whole scene was wrong and thoroughly disappointed me. It was as if Harry just ran through the maze and the maze kept on opening and closing new paths... What an obstacle! (Sarcasm) And Harry didn't use his 'compass' spell.*Finally the battle scene with Voldemort was cool but after he breaks the wand connection Harry had to struggle his way back to the cup (to return to Hogwarts)... He fights his way back casting off spells and dodging incoming attacks. In the movie he just jumps to the cup summons it and zooms out of there. NO SUSPENSE! It was supposed to be highly difficult to escape.I know this is a harsh and picky review but I expected and got a heck of a lot from the book and the movie just could not attain that high level for me! The movie is still worth seeing but with a lot of grains of salt. I hope to God they release a special edition with an improved ending... especially the maze. If I could re-do one scene it would be the maze. ",3.0
" I loved the book Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and thought it was one of the best in the series. The movie adaptation though decent enough on its own takes far too many liberties with the book leaving out many crucial plot points.The story in a nutshell - Harry and his friends Ron & Hermione enter their fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and find the school playing host to students from Beaubaxton & Durmstrang schools of magic. The main event of the year is the Triwizard Tournament where one champion from each school will be selected to participate. Of course Harry finds himself [without entering his name] being selected to participate as well and together with the other three selected champions [Cedric Diggory from Hogwarts Fleur de la Couer from Beaubaxton and Viktor Krum from Durmstrang] embarks on fulfilling the three tasks set for them encountering intrigue danger and also the very possible rise of a menacing evil in the form of Harry's arch nemesis Lord Voldemort.As for leaving out crucial plot points the movie does not develop the strengthening bonds developing between Harry and his godfather Sirius Black which is very much evident and well-developed in the book. The moviemakers also took a lot of liberties in changing some events to suit the movie even changing the characters at times [in the book it is Dobby the house elf that helps Harry with the second task not Neville Longbottom as portrayed in the movie]. There are other quibbles that I shall not enumerate here for the sake of brevity.That being said the movie itself is quite fun to watch I liked the way the Beaubaxtons and Durmstrangs made their entrance. Also the underwater scene for Harry's second task in the Triwizard Tournament is superbly done. The actors playing Harry[Dan Radcliffe] Ron {Rupert Grint]& Hermione [Emma Watson] have truly matured in their roles here and their performances make for compelling viewing. Hermione has blossomed into a beautiful young lady and the boys too seem to be taking notice of the opposite sex [[both develop crushes] all very natural given that they are now young adolescents. The Yule Ball is depicted beautifully on-screen. The actor playing Mad Eye Moody [the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher] is quite a treat to watch with his weird goggling eye and mannerisms.The CGI effects are impressive as with the other Potter films -there are dragons grindylows [water demons] etc to entertain viewers.Overall though this is a fun movie I still prefer the previous three in the Harry Potter franchise mostly because the first three tried their best to stay faithful to the books and this one took too many liberties[though I admit at over 700 pages long it is a bit hard to include every single important detail]. Nevertheless I would recommend adding it to your collection if you're a fan of the series. ",3.0
" I was really looking forward to watching this movie. All the people say it's a really good fun movie with no dull parts at all. After I watched I was kind of disapointed. I expected more of the movie. It's rated PG-13 for some violence. Yes it is kind of violent but it kind of gross at the same time. That is the reason why I rated this three stars. I also wish that Draco ahd a bigger part. Out of all the characters I liked Cedric Diggory and Draco.There are new characters in this movie. Victor Krum the bon-bon Bulgarian who is a quiditch player. Cedric Diggory in Hufflepuff. A good looking and well behaved boy. Fleur Delacour a French lady who Ron likes. Cho Chang an Asian girl who Harry falls for. Rita Skeeter the news reporter for the 'Daily Prophet'. Also Alastor 'Mad Eye' Moody. A friend of Dumbledore and teaches Defense Against Dark Arts. Alright out of these new characters I think Katie Leung (Cho Chang) was not good at acting in this movie. Yes it is her first movie but still I think she could have done better. And why does Harry Potter fall for Cho Chang when she is not pretty? Well a lot of people may think she's pretty but I really don't. I'm an Asian myself and I've seen better looking girls (No offense.) The character Rita Skeeter is a funny but annoying character played by Miranda Richardson. She also plays in 'The Phantom of the Opera' as the character Madame Giry.In this movie there's something that didn't quite appear in the other films. Romance. You can see more of Ron and Hermione liking each other. When Hermione goes out with Victor Krum Ron becomes very jealous and in the end the Hermione and Ron start arguing. I feel sorry for Hermione there. You can also see a little romance between Cho and Harry. But Cho likes Cedric.So here's the story",3.0
" After watching the GOF with my kids albeit skipping the scary scenes I came to realize one HUGE glaring omission from the movie and that's the compelling music score of John Williams. In Azkaban I remember a flute tooling around as we came into a conversation with Harry and Lupin on the bridge or the music when the class learns what a Boggart is with Lupin meeting Sirius for the first time as a wolf etc... As in ALL the Potter films except this one we have a force behing the scenes that helps propel the movie but not in GOF? Even the opening credits all but eliminate the main tune. As for the plots the elves should have been given some due as they do play a role in the upcoming Phoenix and Half-Blood books moreso than in Goblet. Dobby did little screen time in Azkaban but it was effective and made sense-- let's keep the elves!!! If there's anyone who wondered how they crammed the first 1/4 of the book into 30 minutes devoting so little time getting to and then at the Quidditch World Cup and next we're welcoming the Beauxbatons to Hogwart's and why please tell me??? We had a dragon flight and fight and Sirius in the firepit two scenes totally made up and done for added drama; we don't need to make things up with what's written in the books. What makes the first 3 so magical is the finer points that they get right; chocolate frogs spiders dementors characters. It's all in the details and you don't need to include ALL of them just those that matter most and this is where Newell or the screenplay writer or both are missing their marks. As for Dumbledore I was sad to see no immersion into the true character by Michael Gambon (a fine actor) as in the book and certainly not in tune with the character when he shakes Harry; very much not like Albus at all I'm afraid. This is where I miss the talented Sir Harris in the role from the first two movies. All in all good action most times in step with the overall element of the book but not the best; that still goes to the Azkaban movie which I still watch over and over again. Let's just hope that the relative newcomer David Yates can bring back the magic and sense of wonder that GOF seemed to be lacking not be afraid that it's a long movie (that's what Director's Cuts are for ",3.0

" I was upset that there was not an expaned version of this film. If I hadent already sold my original copy I would have not purchased this one. ",3.0
" The Following Review is about the Ultimate Edition only NOT THE FILM!Being a hardcore Harry Potter fan for the past 10+ years had led me to purchasing this Ultimate Edition (along with Prisoner of Azkaban's) without reading any description about this edition having NO EXTENDED VERSION like the last two previous movies had. This 'ultimate' edition comes with three DVDs two of which were in the 2-Disc Special Edition that was released when GoF first released in DVD form (and which many people including myself already own). The price of this set of DVDs is only for the last disc which is about the Sound in the Harry Potter world along with a few collectible cards and a photobook. I find this very disappointing because I am so sure that they could do a lot better than this. Putting the deleted scenes onto a separate disc (like how SS and CoS Ultimate Editions had) won't take WB that much time and money but they failed to do so making the buyers feel like they have been ripped off. I am sure the HP crew have so much more contents filmed in the past 10 years that the movies were filmed why do they keep those scenes to themselves? Most of the contents on this edition were seen by all the HP fans that follow this series' journey. I seriously don't know what WB is playing at because I feel like I have been ripped off for the contents. I guess this is worth the buy since I want everything Harry Potter but I just wish they put more contents in these 'ultimate' editions.I will not be buying the regular DVDs/Blu-rays when DH1 and DH2 come out because the ultimate editions will just have the same stuff anyways. Thanks WB! ",3.0
" ****SPOILER ALERT****Okay...the GoF book is 734 pages and the movie adaptation is a little over 2.5 hours. Of course a lot of stuff was going to be cut. Some of the cuts I was able to deal with (e.g. Hermione and S.P.E.W.). Unfortunately many of the characters (especially the other Triwizard champions) were severely underdeveloped as a result.Giving Viktor Krum only two lines in the entire movie was inexcusable. So was cutting out the entire Quidditch World Cup match. The viewer isn't given enough reason to care about Krum or why he became a potential love interest for Hermione. He simply comes across as a dumb jock. The movie should have shown a couple minutes of the World Cup match to show off his prowess and little scene here and there of him interacting with Hermione (I was actually quite peeved that the didn't show her teaching Viktor how to pronounce her name).The other champions were likewise poorly developed. You learn practically nothing about Cedric or Fleur Delacour (who got the least screentime out of the four champions). Fleur was simply another pretty face; they even cut the part about her being a quarter-veela (which was why the boys were swooning over her in the book). And if I didn't read the book I probably wouldn't have cared too much about Cedric's death near the end of the movie.Even Ron and Hermione were mainly relegated to the background. They didn't even use any kind of magic for the entire film! It would've been nice to show how exactly Hermione was helping Harry (like with the Accio spell) instead of just having her simper and worry. Ron seemed to be purely comic relief.My other quibble was that the first task was WAY too long. The dragon chasing Harry around Hogwarts was ridiculous. They could've easily shaved off a good five minutes and instead use that time for the World Cup match they DIDN'T show (can you tell that I was mad about that being cut out?)Don't get me wrong. I still enjoyed the movie; it did capture the spirit of the book pretty well. And I was VERY happy to see the ferret scene (YES!)Overall impression",3.0

" I agree with the previous reviewer. Prisoner of Azkaban in my opinion was the best book in the Harry Potter series and the POA movie was the best one in the series so far. The POA movie was magical(sic) and stunning. Michael Cuaron was great at handling the difficult 'Time Travel' concept and made the movie extremely enjoyable.Goblet of Fire on the other hand looks like an express train only intent on arriving at its destination with no time for passing sceneries. Everything except the Yule ball and the tournaments are a fast blur and I particularly felt the rushed script kind of took away the essence of the movie. Snape Draco Sirius and even Skeeter are just for scene fillers with nothing much to do. Gambon is unconvincing as Dumbledore. I feel that the director could have handled the movie more creatively.That said the DVD is great. ",3.0

" This is by far the best film so far. The acting had slightly improved. The crying scence performed by Daniel Radcliffe in the prisoner of azkaban when he finds out Sirius Black was his godfather was so bad it was laughable. Emma Watson makes Hermione sound very precocious and upper class. Rupert Grint is quite good though and is funny. I read a review on Narnia in the Daily Mail that said the childrens acting in the lion the witch and the wardrobe was ten times better than harry potter especially Georgie Henleys performance (played Lucy). I have to hand it to the actors though. This film was moderately better. The music in the film is beautiful and the under water scene was very well done.child age 13 ",3.0
" The thing that made the Harry Potter movies super was the fact they followed the books so closely this is the worst excuse for a Harry Potter movie yet the last one wasn't that great but much better than this I was sooo looking forward to this book being a movie and have never been more disappointed it is so far off the book they have made it ridiculous I am so angry I certainly hope they don't do this with the rest of them I know one thing for sure I will rent before I buy from now on The books are so good and the movies brought them to life this is just not right its an outrage to a true Harry fan and I sincerely hope that this is not going to happen to the next books they are so good and the next books are crucial to the story this was such a bad job of such a good book I hope they changed directors I feel very cheated and I am left wondering if J K Rowling has made so much money that she doesnt care about he fans anymore or if she has stopped overseeing the making of the films because this movie left wondering if I was even watching the right movie at times If they wanted to shorten it why then would you add things that never happened and if you were going to stray so far away from the telling of the story how then are u going to tie it in with the rest of the bokks because alot of important things were left out of this movie that tie into the next that I don't know how it is going to work out that will make it right This was my favorite book and it was sad what was done to it as a movie I am glad I didn't spend fifty dollars to see it in a theatre because I really would have been angry as it is I guess now it is just a waiting game to see what they do to the next one I for one would have preferred a longer movie than to have had this happen ",3.0

" I have severely mixed feelings about this movie. It was good cinematically with amazing special effects and great acting. But it basically skipped from main event to main event not explaining the few bits it kept in (Rita Skeeter Neville's heartbreaking story etc.) It seemed VERY rushed-through.For instance there was the case of Sirius Black. (If I sound biased he IS my favorite character...) It gave the impression of 'the entire last movie was about him but instead of giving him decent screen time we'll cram him into a (very odd and much different from the book) fireplace scene'. I'm not slighting Gary Oldman as usual his performance as everyone's favorite ex-Azkaban convict was brilliant. It was the amount of screen time that bugged me. (Plus it's absolutely against his character to think he'd not be there right after Harry's horrific experience in the graveyard. Heck AZKABAN couldn't even keep him from helping his godson!)Neville was acted spectacularly by Matthew Lewis but his parental trauma was barely explained and it was never fully communicated to you the reason Fake Moody was so gleeful at Neville's reaction to the Cruciatus Curse -- he himself had participated in the torture of Frank and Alice Longbottom. And again Brendan Gleeson was great except for that stupid eye. I always pictured it as a huge slimy moving eye not a pirate's eye patch but hey that's just me.So all in all it was a good movie but it could have been so much better. I'm praying they don't mess up my favorite book of the series in the movie adaptation",3.0
" I loved this movie; it is my favorite of the four thus far. I feel that it kept its pacing much better than the previous movie despite the excising of huge sections of the book.However I write this review to point out that I found the transfer of the movie so dark that it was nearly unwatchable. Everything was so dark that in many shots people were mere silhouets against the background. I saw this movie in the theater and remember that the shots weren't like that then. Cranking up the gamma worked but then the picture was washed out.I'm glad I rented before I bought. I'll wait until another edition comes out (after all 7 movies are out?) before purchasing. ",3.0
" As a fan of the Harry Potter series I found the movie disappointing. I know that not everything in the book could make it into the movie but more content then what was used would have made 'Goblet of Fire' better. They skipped around so much it made it hard to follow the plot line. I would have liked to see the Dursleys and the rest of the Weasley clan in this one. Hagrid and Professor McGonagall seemed to be relegated to the background and the scene of Harry talking to Sirius in the fire was not realistic looking. Not too crazy about Michael Gambon as Dumbledore; the late Richard Harris was much better in the role.The movie didn't do the book justice. I can only hope 'Order of the Phoenix' is better. Don't waste your money on 'Goblet' and put it towards the last book in the series when it's published. ",3.0
" To me HP4 is the weakest in the series. It's kinda boring and doesn't have too much of a plot.

Each task is very dangerous. After the first task there is a Yule Ball and shows that Hermione is beginning to fall for Ron. During the last task Harry will come face-to-face with Voldemort reborn.

" Well this is my 4th HP DVD review...I'm just waiting for Warner Brothers to get a clue and acknowledge their adult consumers in the DVDs extras.The movie is very good though not my favorite and I think it's because there was just so much to the film and it jumped from one thing to the next which left one feeling rather dizzy. I've read the book and realize it was a tremendously difficult task to try to encompass that tome into one feature-length film. But also it seems a little cheesy and schtick-y in some areas (Moody/Crouch's tongue-flicking Karkaroff's overall portrayal and although I love the true belly-laugh humor juxtaposed with the heart-breaking drama it still just isn't my choice as number one in the series.As for the dvd I'm equally 'blah' about it as well. Nothing new to report here. I'm an adult fan of the HP series and still waiting for WB to get a clue about their adult consumers. The HP series has NEVER been solely for kids but you wouldn't know it watching their extras.There's the same old stupid games that will bore anyone over the age of 12 out of their gourd. And there's not a lot in the 'goodie bag' either. Interviews with Dan Emma and Rupert and some featurettes of how they did the sets how they created the creatures in CGI etc. etc. Have I just become jaded by watching hundreds of DVD extras? The HP GoF extras just seem formulaic...I keep hoping with each new release (at least in the HP series) that we'll see something exciting refreshing intriguing....different...MAGICAL. And...nothing.Yes the interviews with the kids are interesting (I'm continually floored by how articulate Dan Emma and some of the others are!) and it was pretty cool to see how life on the Leavesdon Studio set for HP is (as well as to see some well-deserved air-time go to the 'champions' of the movie. But there wasn't ONE interview segment with the adult characters of the film. With their roles relegated to cameo-style appearances in the film I think WB owed it to viewers and the actors to include them in a special series in the extras but no. No Maggie Smith no Robbie Coltrane no Michael Gambone (and where was he on #3?). But SHAME on WB for TOTALLY ignoring Brendan Gleeson and virtually ignoring Ralph Fiennes. I mean COME ON! It's Voldy's big debut and just one little featurette?Sorry I'm usually brimming with praise for the HP dvds but not this time. Hopefully WB will give us something new with #5. ",3.0
" I truly hope that this director is not going to direct the next. While the Goblet of Fire has it's moments I felt rushed. Too much time spent on the 'important' moments and not enough time spent on the wonder and texture that the Harry Potter story has. Yes yes I realize that this is a movie and not the book (yada yada yada... save it!) It was still supposed to have been true to the texture quality storyline and magic of Harry Potter and Rowling's writing. There are moment's in the movie that are taken out of context and therefore make no sense. Only one example is that Ron is instantly ready to cut Harry out of his life after all their bonding and closeness. The other main characters and the fine actors that play them are reduced to a passing reference. Michael Gambdon's portrayl of Dumbledore is even worse ( if that is possible) than his first. I wish he would read the books. He portrays Dumbledore as a bumbling slobbery-mouthed victim of senility. The movie could have been greatly helped by either adding at least 30 minutes to the movie or by dividing the movie into two parts (it would have been worth it.) The Harry Potter series has too large a following to fool around with the story this much. The movie is choppy at best and left me with a feeling of being cheated because the public is so addicted to the stories that they will pay their money anyway regardless of the swill that is passed out for a movie. A collection of a couple of good scenes and no story. I wanted to see a good movie based on a good book and not a photo gallery. The kids are getting better and better as actors - but not enough to save the movie. I think the public has shown that it will spend extra time to watch a good movie - why not the Harry Potter movies? ",3.0
" Due to his commitment with post-production on Prisoner of Azkaban Alfonso Cuaron opted to step down as director for the fourth Harry Potter film Goblet of Fire allowing another director to take the reigns. Mike Newell best known for Four Weddings and a Funeral and Donnie Brasco became the first British director of the series. Posessing an intimate knowledge of British boarding schools (having attended one himself) allowed Newell to deliver an accurate portrayal of boarding school life. In Newell's film the kids act like kids; they aren't afraid of shouting their feelings when they feel they've been wronged or resorting to fistfights when they feel it's necessary. Even more so than Cuaron Newell adds a feeling of realism to the actions of Hogwarts' student body.One thing I found interesting when comparing Prisoner of Azkaban to Goblet of Fire is that the former has a much darker tone in terms of cinematography and the overall feel of the film than the latter. This is interesting because in the previous Potter installment our hero wasn't in any sort of real danger for the most part. We were just made to believe like the characters in the film that Harry was in danger throughout the entire story. Here Harry finds himself in much more danger his life on the line at multiple turns but the tone is much lighter. There's also more comedy in this film moments like Professor McGonagall teaching Gryffindor's fourth years how to dance with the help of Ron Weasley.There are less new adult parts in this film than in previous installments but the Harry Potter franchise still attracted great actors and actresses to join the cast. Madame Maxine of Beauxbatons is played by multiple Laurence Olivier Theater Award-winner Frances de la Tour and the amazing Brendan Gleeson (28 Days Later... Gangs of New York) portrays Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody. Goblet of Fire also attracted quality actors to play the younger parts. Among them are the then-almost-unknown Robert Pattinson (now unfortunately best known for his role in the Twilight series) playing the role of Cedric Diggory Bulgarian-born Stanislov Ianevski as Viktor Krum and Clemence Poesy as Fleur Delacour. They all do an admirable job of portraying these distinct characters.Goblet of Fire is a fun film to watch but of the movies that have come out so far I think I have the most problems with this film. I understand Newell fought the studio to keep this film as one rather than splitting it into two films and I respect that but there were way too many scenes that were over-dramatized. Harry's first task against the Hungarian Horntail was extended way beyond what it should have been and Harry's venture into the lake during the second task of the Tri-wizard tournament was slightly overwrought as well. These may seem like petty arguments but these scenes took time away from other plots or subplots that could have furthered the overall story of the movie.That's not even my biggest gripe with the movie. The problem I most have with this movie is the characterizations. Michael Gambon playing Dumbledore never read the Harry Potter books and never felt the need to. This is very apparent in the way he attacks Potter when his name appears in the Goblet of Fire. The reaction has more in common with a regular school headmaster than a seemingly all-knowing wizard. The worst issue here though is the portrayal of Barty Crouch Jr. Played by David Tennant who would go on to play Dr. Who we're never left to wonder about Barty's guilt or innocence as we did in the book. From the first moment we see him we have no doubt that he's a Death Eater. We also learn at the end of the movie that he's an Azkaban escapee but no mention is made in the movie of anyone looking for him while the last movie dealt with an Azkaban escapee that everyone in the wizarding world was looking for. This inconsistency is explained in the book and had they spent less time over-dramatizing certain parts of Goblet of Fire it could have been clarified in the film as well.Goblet of Fire saw a rise in box office receipts becoming the second-highest grossing film of the series up to this point with $895.9 million worldwide also making it the highest grossing film of 2005. The promise of more action more comedy and the return of Voldemort in a fully corporeal form may have helped. While Goblet has more than its fair share of problems its probably the most fun to watch of the films thus far and up to this point the finale is the best of the series. ",3.0

" You're probaby thinking is this kid nuts for rating this awesome movie three stars? No I'm not crazy because it's true. Warner Brothers has done it again taking a excellent book by J. K.

They cut out the Dursleys Hermione's petition against having House Elves Winky(Barty Couch's house elf) a certain beetle(read the last chapter where Hermione is clutching a jar with a beetle in it) and a death that should have taken place. They honestly could have done better with this movie. I have the first three movies. I love the first two but once you get to Prisoner of Azkaban the magic begins to crumble.

" This is the only Harry Potter film with an 'international' twist. Watching and analyzing the film we can get insights on how the English-speaking world relate to the other three great European cultures - the German the Russian and the French. While the French in the movie are not disguised the German and the Russian cultures are 'magically' fused into one - they are thinly veiled as the Bulgarians of the Durmstrang Institute. I am referring to the central event of the movie - the so-called Triwizard Tournament which is a magical contest between the wizarding schools of Europe - the Hogwarts the Durmstrang Institute of 'the North' and Beauxbatons Academy of Magic.The Beauxbatons Academy of Magic represents the Francophone culture in the Harry Potter Universe. They have a soft touch and a certain 'je ne sais quoi'. Their Headmaster is Madame Maxime is very tall and looks vaguely like Charles de Gaulle. The name 'Beaux btons' is French for 'beautiful wands'. But with the other school - the Durmstrang Institute - things are more complicated.The name indicates 'Sturm und Drang' a German term for 'emotional turmoil' a codeword for the German romanticism. The students are all boys with military-style buzzcut apparently meaning to represent the Prussian militarism during Word War I. The names like Viktor Krum are Germanic. Bur their headmaster's name Igor Karkaroff is undoubtedly Russian. He is portrayed as an unpleasant and brutish character with bad teeth looking like someone who just walked out the 'Ivan the Terrible' movie try-outs for the mad Tsar Ivan. The Prussians and Russians are fused together in an unpleasant cocktail.The Durmstrang's coat of arms features a double headed eagle indicating that the school may be located in the Russian or Austro-Hungarian Empire. Victor Krum attended the 'Yule Ball' with Hermione Granger looking like the young Wilhelm II wearing the Austrian hussar regiment uniform. Kaiser Wilhelm's middle name was Viktor by the way.We are shown how the 'Anglo-Saxons' successfully compete with other cultures. How they do it? Well with their honesty pragmatism and principle of 'fair-play' boosted by Harry Potter magical powers. They overcome the 'la finesse' of the South and 'la ruse' of the Northerners - the Russo-Germans. They triumphed because the others are lacking some ingredient or another (for example intelligence). It's all 'de bonne guerre' good fun and 'Karkaroff' is a clever though nonsensical name for a Russian ('Kar-Kar' is a sound made by 'Russian' crows as opposite to 'Caw-Caw' in the English-speaking countries). But stereotypes are easily discernable. You ask so what? My point is that the ideology which goes hand in glove with cultural stereotypes is everywhere. Even in movies for kids. ",3.0
" I'll probably get pummeled from the fanboys and girls who read this but I have to put in my 2 cents. I realize these are made from the books but come on...I have seen the previous HP movies and I must say these are becoming like the Star Wars franchise 'if it has Harry Potter's name on it it will sell regardless of content'.First the good. As usual the visual effects save the movie. They are great except the ridiculous CGI mermaids during the water contest scenes. Sadly that's all the good I can say about this film.I actually found myself glancing at my watch and praying for the end of this extremely LONG movie. First the plot has become predictable in these stories. Rest assured that if a new teacher is introduced they are most likely to be the villain. We find the kids back at Hogwart's starting a new year of school. The entire story revolves around a contest where the child participants face death if they lose. What kind of school is this? There is no suspense when Harry Potter's name is picked from the goblet because we already know he survives to the next story. The story introduces characters that have no purpose to move the story along. For example the asian girl that Harry Potter has the hots for has like 2 lines of dialogue and we never see her again. Huh? There is a mind numbingly long ball room dance scene which ruins the pace of the film.As always the movie strangely ends just before school is out after numerous plot holes that a 18 wheeler could fall through. I won't ruin the film by divulging anymore info except to say this installment is mediocre at best. ",3.0

Not worth watching a second time but if you're collecting the films and the books you need this. I also bought the first DVD I saw and it had NO extras. Not a conversation not a deleted scene nothing.I wish they had done two films and had Harry's family and the Quidditch game on a separate disk just for fun.Like I said not the worst film in the world but not a good film either.

" This movie was okay.

I suspect moviegoers are now going to go see the next Harry Potter movie just to see how it turned out instead of a genuine interest in the actual movie.I was also disappointed to find that now for the first time in the series that the movie makers are charging extra for the two-disc version calling it deluxe.

" This movie was the most empty of all four films so far. I did not like Newell's direction at all. I'm not sure he 'gets' the Harry Potter universe. The fourth book has so much depth to offer a story line yet Newell missed it completely. The movie is nothing but special effects and people moving from point a to point b.I understand the book was very long but this film lacked serious relationship and interaction between the characters.Its a shame that these films cannot be produced fast enough to keep up with the maturing cast. The actors are already too old for the roles.Very disappointed in this film and the direction.Having said that it should be enjoyable for fans of the series and there's enough in here to keep attention - simply because the film moves at such pace.If you'll like Harry Potter you'll like this one but if not then it won't help convert you.

" I liked the movie but somehow I guess from all of the buildup to it I left the theater disappointed. It felt like we raced through it and that it was over too quick. Many things were left out of the movie that appeared in the book but I'm not going to whine about that too much. I feel they should have stretched it to a three hour movie to add in more character developments of Rita Skeeter Fluer Crum and Cedric. We don't get to know them and didn't feel the full impact of Cedric's death. Also Dumbledore is just weird now with all the bling he wears and his man-handling of Harry after his name is coughed out of the goblet was totally unDumbledore-like. That said I loved the whole Yule-Ball scene especially Hermione's heartbreak. She is one to look out for in the future to be a great actress. All-in-all I'd give it three and a half stars but maybe after seeing it again I will like it more.

" Before I begin let me say that I just recently discovered how amazing the Harry Potter series is. Although I had seen the first 2 movies I never thought of reading the books until recently. That being said let me add that I thought the first two movies were very good representations of thebooks and the characters that are used in the movies are true to what Rowlings was trying to portray in her books. Now I turn my attention to a heavy weight of a book in Goblet of Fire. Amazing book and I was looking forward to finishing this and then seeing how the movie did this one justice was I disappointed.I am terribly sorry but I am NOT going to defend this movie and cry like many of the other people who reviewed this movie. 'The book is over 700 pages' 'there is so much detail' blah blah blah. Well if it is that difficult then DON'T INSULT ME BY MAKING THIS MOVIE AT ALL. If I am interested in the story and the movie is an accurate portrail I don't mind sitting through 3 to 3.5 hours to get the story right. That concept worked for the Lord of the Rings why couldn't it work in this case as well?The best part of the book was the shroud of mystery surrounding the person who was Lord Voldemorts other faithful follower. The movie decided to destroy that right at the beginning by showing a 3rd person in the house with Wormtail and Voldemort. Then lets just skip Bertha Jorkins without whom Voldemort would have never of known about the world cup and Triwizard Tournament. The book did an excellent job at putting doubts in the readers mind about number of characters 2 of which Ludo Bagman and Winky the house-elf never made the movie. At no point in the movie did the viewer get the real story on Barty Crouch. A power hungry anti-dark wizard with a private life filled with personal tragedy. The Pensieve trials in the movie were terrible. They completely hacked and changed the story making Crouches knowledge of his son a shock at the trial in the movie. What about him being in prison and supposedly dying in Azkaban?This knowledge gave the reader a sense that the son could never have been part of the plot at Hogwarts to harm Harry Potter. The movie instead shows the son at the trial the same face you see at the beginning of the movie so it is easy to deduce that he is connected to the plot against Harry. In the book the son's trial was surronded by the story of Neville's parents and the use of the Cruciatus curse. The movie went as far as to show Neville's complete demoralizing nature after Moody used the curse in class but then the movie let the story dangle and fade away.The explaination about why two wands bonded during the battle was weak as well. I do agree with another reviewer that the story of Rita Skeeter was weak and not even needed. In the book the story was to show her as a pushy emblesher and person just trying to get a 'Juicy' story even if it ruined other peoples lives. Why not go the extra distance and show how she got her stories and Hermiones vendetta and capture of Rita in the end. If they weren't going to do that why not just replace that story altogther with the house-elf story and S.P.E.W.Finally there are some good points. The Goblet scenes and actual Triwizard Tournament was done well. I thought the first two tasks were done very well. The 3rd stage however was pretty lame as if it just got in the way of the confrontation between Harry and the resurrected lord himself. No creatures no riddle just a waste.So there are my 2 brass knuts worth the book deserved much better than this. I am very disappointed here and even more disappointed in the people who read this book but gave this movie 5 stars. To them and this movie I say Riddikulus!! ",3.0
" I'm a big fan of the Harry Potter books simply because I am hopelessly attatched to the characters. The books are fun but JK Rowling's real strength is in her character development. Up till now I have thought the movies were worth seeing and I've never been distressed when they didn't match up exactly with the book. This movie however has completely lost the integrity of the three main characters. All Hermione does is look cute and cry a lot which is so wrong I just wanna throw up. Ron is comic relief and Harry's just a mixed up teenager. They're just turning Harry Potter into another Hollywood action film with typical good-looking teenaged leads. The reason I give it 2 or 3 stars is because the acting is very good (the three kids have actually improved their acting over the years even though their characterizations are faltering). Voldemort and Mad-Eye Moody are well acted and of course so are Hagrid Snape McGonagal etc. The special effects are also incredible. They could have left more of the story in without making the movie too long but overall a decent adaptation of the book. The main unfortunate thing about this movie is destruction of the original characters and I have a feeling that the Harry Potter movies are going down the drain. ",3.0
" To say I was disappointed by Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire when I first saw the film is a major understatement. My favorite parts of the book come right up front-the arrival of the Weasley's to pick up Harry from the Dursley's and the Quidditch World Cup-so seeing one part cut to barely a mention and the other cut completely made me in a word livid less than five minutes into the movie. After that it didn't have a chance with me. Granted I know you can't pack everything in a massive book like 'Goblet of Fire' and have it fit in a movie less than four hours long; however directors have a really terrible knack of looking at novels as starting points rather than blueprints. When they go hacking at a novel to cut the fat they inevitably cut out muscle and bone in their attempts to shorten a novel and make it more 'cinematic.' Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a perfect example of this. Director Mike Newell a man best-known for directing Four Weddings and a Funeral and therefore the absolute worst person you could pick to direct a Harry Potter movie hacks at J.K. Rowling's novel not with a carving knife but a machete. What's left is a confusing mess. That said I have to admit as my expectations lowered for DVD viewing I did enjoy the film more. It allowed me to focus more on the excellent effects Oscar-nominated sets and the much-improved acting of the kids especially Daniel Radcliff. Still there is a lot I don't like about the film. Plot points are changed for no apparent reason other than to tinker which will have an impact on future adaptations of the remaining books. The music by Patrick Doyle (a very good but in over his head composer) is so inappropriate in parts it's laughable as all of John Williams' three previous scores save for the scant use of 'Hedwig's Theme' here and there is thrown out. Most everyone except Harry has their screen time reduced to almost cameo levels. This movie IS about Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire PERIOD. If you're a fan of the books and can watch the movies as their own entity you'll enjoy Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. If you're like me and have a problem separating the two be sure to watch it more than once to appreciate what's good about the movie and get past what's so very very wrong. ",3.0
" My opinion is based solely on viewing the movie I have never read the books.When it was over I felt like 15 or so minutes were missing from the movie. Anybody who follows the Harry Potter series knows there is another movie to come until we reach number 7 but this one was too open-ended. The others had closure of some kind.The relationship between Ron and Hermoine was almost bitter at the end and somewhat unexplained the comment about 'things will really change next year' was not really explained the return of Voldemort and how that was left was just odd.Of the 4 this is my least favorite. I did not hate it I did not dislike it but if I said I loved it or liked it as much as I like the others I would be lying.I was a bit taken aback about the role of the Malfoy's and even Snape which made this movie interesting but there was still so much more to be explained. I suppose we have to wait for the Order of the Phoenix right?I would never tell anybody not to see the movie or even purchase it if you like the HP series but be prepared and understand that this movie is dark and is not as light-hearted and magical as the others.

" As a devoted Austen fan and having read Northanger Abbey where Fanny Burney's Camilla is mentioned I thought I'll give the book a try. Although it proved quite enjoyable for a time but after 500 pages and at least '500' recurring events where the main (?) characters Camilla & Edgar almost seem to make it just to end up further and further apart I got really bored. The novel would be much better if it were 400 pages shorter.Burney might have inspired Jane Austen but Austen exceeded and outsmarted her in every way. Where Austen's plots are tight without any unnecessary subplots and going-ons just for the sake of writing another 200 pages Burney keeps repeating events her characters find themselves over and over in similar circumstances without adding anything new to plot or to characterization making the whole novel very tiresome after a while. I admit that Jane Austen also used cliche characters but her genius breathed life into them - they are well-drawn and have depth - while Burney's characters - even or especially the main characters with the exception of the wonderful Eugenia - stay flat and common place as if cut out from a newspaper.In my opinion Camilla the heroine is simply one of the most frustratingly perfect female cliche characters that appeared in print. Besides some very common place deeds she doesn't seem very special at all. What is apparent right form the start that her family friends and admirers assume her perfect without any other ground that her being pretty and good-humoured. And it seems the author was quite satisfied with this kind of characterization for she didn't feel the need to emphasize Camilla's good qualities with any external actions really but what is cliche and boring. As a result Camilla remains a rather one-sided flat character without any real progress than being understood rather than misunderstood by Edgar at the end of the painfully long 1000 pages. The most incredible and discrediting thing to me was when at a social assembly the boorish suitor of Camilla - not at all a gentleman - starts abusing Eugenia's appearance and Camilla instead of putting him to place or at least leaving him on the spot if she is such a coward to say anything - like I am sure Elizabeth Bennet Elinor Dashwood or Emma Woodhouse would have done - just remains there sitting stupidly and mutely. So much for sisterly love!I tend to agree with my fellow reviewers that Eugenia is a far more interesting and profound character her personal tragedy and the courage she bears it with make her endearing. Hers was the -unfortunately only - subplot that I followed with the most excitement and sympathy.Still the novel was an interesting experience for me to know what was considered popular reading in that period and as such quite useful with my studies. ",3.0
" Like the other readers who reviewed this book I am a huge Austen fan. I've read 'Pride and Prejudice' so many times I can quote whole paragraphs by heart. So when I discovered Fanny Burney a contemporary of Austen's I couldn't wait to get into her books. 'Camilla' is the second book by Burney I've read and it's reinforced my initial impression that Burney is not up to Austen's caliber as a novelist. She tells an interesting story but her characters seem too much like stock pieces acting on a stage and the overly dramatic dialogue doesn't help matters much. Austen's genius was in not only telling a mesmerizing tale but in bringing her characters so completely to life that they seem totally real. Austen's novels are of their own time and for all time; Burney's books are stuck rigidly in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.A singular problem with 'Camilla' is Camilla herself; she comes across more as a sweet but empty-headed ingenue tripping from one mess to another and managing to make mountains out of molehills. Her younger sister Eugenia crippled and disfigured with smallpox but well-read and profound is a far more interesting figure and if she had been the center of the book it would have been a far more interesting book. By 600 pages we get kind of tired of Camilla's incessant mess-ups and just wish she'd hurry up and marry Edgar and have done with it. As another reviewer stated I would like to see 'Camilla' brought to the screen; with the fat trimmed from the novel a good script and in the hands of a good director it might be a better movie than a book. Taken on its own 'Camilla' is not a bad book at all; but there is no way it can stand up to Austen. ",3.0

" It's a bit country a bit folk and a bit of pop but the best thing going for it is the quality of the voice and the singing of the songs. The songs themselves are nothing to brag about. There is nothing wrong with them but they are to my mind 'bulk items'. By that I mean the songs used to flesh out the single hit on an album. In this case though that is all there is.That being said she is a good singer and has some fine singing guests. Her musicians are good too. Its just the songs that are wanting. ",3.0
" This is Nanci Griffith's 14th album and while I agree with many that it is her best in a decade that doesn't say a whole lot. Her last album 'Clock Without Hands' was really her only attempt in that time frame to achieve any high level of artistry and we all know that didn't work out very well. She has therefore retreated back to more familiar ground with this latest effort and doesn't take many chances. The music is very 'easy listening' and varies between folk country and pop all played with the usual group of musicians.The songs do have a nice theme running through them and I think the writing on the two Vietnam songs as well as 'Big Blue Ball Of War' is very good and proves that Nanci can still do it. Besides those three the only other very good track is 'Angels' not written by Nanci and inspired by the film 'Wings Of Desire'.The album features three duets(Jimmy Buffett Mac Macanally and Keith Carradine) but none of them are very strong and six songs written entirely by someone else so the process of diluting Nanci's talent with other artists is apparent here like it has been on most all of her albums since the late 80s. This one is better than most of the recent ones however and for that I am thankful. ",3.0
" I have listened to Nanci for almost 30 yearsheck I used to see her at The Hole in the Wall in Austin and she played for tips! My only complaint regarding her new album and the last three or four is she has developed a strange speaking and singing style. She does not have a fluid or flowing singing style;it sounds as though she is forcing words out of her mouth in an accent that borders on Irish by way of Texas. I do have to agree that the lower registers of her voice are a welcome change. Greg ",3.0
" Thin pickings from this increasingly eccentric artist. This is a ramshackle collection of songs connected by leftover Vietnam themes that could usefully have ended on Nanci's last album. What's this obsession with the word Indochine?

" As entertainment this movie works. Geena Davis especially makes it worth watching. (Hanks too I guess although I seem to be one of the few people who think he's a bit overrated).As history and as a message movie -- it fails. For starters in the first year of the AAGPBL they played softball not baseball.Some of the actors were convincing as ballplayers; others were not. In the latter category was Lori Petty. When she pitched she would grunt and throw out her right leg to make it look as if she were really throwing a fireball in there. But if you watch the ball instead of her it's clear that her 'fast ball' is going about 20 mph.But my main complaint is in the 'message'; which I guess is that women can do anything men can do. Sure. But Penny Marshall undermined that concept with the fact that in the movie the league only became popular after a sexy shot of 'Dottie Hinson' catching a foul while doing a split was published in Life magazine and after the team members started rewarding men who caught foul balls with a kiss.

Rooting for the team the whole movie and then kaboom....they don't win!!! I found Geena Davis and Lori Petty's characters to be the epitome of self-effacing selfish whiny losers. Davis allows Petty to blame her for all the things that have gone wrong in her life; the whiny little sister who is always in the shadow of her more accomplished bigger sister wore thin particularly since Petty was so self-centered in it. Then take Davis...she selfishly leaves the team at the World Series then comes back in game 7 and expects to play despite the fact that stand in Alice has played the first six games. And then in the film's climactic moment she 'drops' the ball all to allow her whiny sister a chance to be 'the star' of the moment. And then afterwards the two act like they are the best of friends in a maudlin huggy poo scene.

" Sir Neville Marriner needs little introduction. He has given music lovers lovely interpretations of Baroque music (Handel and Vivaldi). I am quite fond of his Bach renditions as well (two LPs on the Argo label come to mind of various concertos). He has recorded great Mozart especially some of the symphonies (25). Here he ventures into the familiar territory of Christmas music in a CD called CHRISTMAS WITH THE ACADEMY. Academy and chorus that is. The program is quite varied with opening and closing church bells. Two excerpts from L'ENFANCE DU CHRIST. French carols sung in the original with the accents strangely placed I mean as far as the word meanings go. ES IST EIN ROS ENTSPRUNGEN and STILLE NACHT in the language of origin. Good overall renditions of O COME ALL YE FAITHFUL and AWAY IN A MANGER. But one is left with wanting more.

" Kirby is a GREAT franchise Kirby is a great and original character and the man who created Kirby is one of the masterminds behind Super Smash Bros. However this game is lacking. In Kirby you swallow enemies to get different abilities so that you can fight enemies. That is still there. The great feeling of controlling the pink puffball is also still here. However the level designs feel repeated and the difficulty of the game is WAAAY too easy. Even for a Kirby game. The story-line (even though no Kirby has that great of a story other than Canvas Curse) is very weak. At the beginning Kirby is about to eat a piece of cake when the Squeak Squad steals it. So he chases and you have the game. At the end (which comes relatively quickly even for a Kirby game) all he does is eat his cake. He didn't even seem to help any other people!The usage of the touchscreen is almost unbearable. Technically what is on the touchscreen is well Kirby's stomach. Here you can store bubbles of copy abilities and mix abilities. However this is way too hard to try and do. And the limited space is confusing as well as the fact of there being no use of storing more than one copy ability. Oops for Hal Labs.They added what seemed to be nothing new other than an excruciating new touch screen play which is not good. I believe some of the music has been used before in more than one Kirby.

" I read 'One Night of Scandal' partly as a change of pace from my usual reading and partly because I was running out of books to read!I found I could skip over quite a bit of it without feeling I'd missed anything. The changes in tone from light banter to heavy brooding drama to the usual 'steamy' scenes were pretty much the standard for books like this. Since I'm not a big romance fan anyway I didn't mind the emphasis on the relationship between Lottie and Allegra though I felt the last chapter was a bit too predictably melodramatic. Still the story was at its best when it was just the two of them.Hayden was a bit too wussy to take seriously and I didn't really mind his occasional absences. All the buildup with his background and his first wife's 'troubles' didn't quite deliver what it promised.Recommended for those who like historical romance novels but not for those who are really picky about plot development!

" I have been reading as many of Medeiros books as I can find. Some have been really good and with humor to the story others have been kind of odd.This one was kind of on the dull side. Too much time was spent going over and over the first wife and how upset she was. Then more about the fact that she died. The daughter was just plain weird.Not impressed with this book. ",3.0
" I wasn't very happy with this book after reading a Kiss to Remember. The characters weren't together enough to fall in Love. Most of the time was with Lottie and Allegra. I also seemed more of a love story between Hayden and Justine. This situation also confused me....did he love her like a wife or child (as Ned indicted). If he loved her like a child then I can see him not sleeping with her for 6 years but otherwise don't get that. I am usually turned off by romance novels when the one involved is still in love with someone else. All in all I hated that everytime Hayden was thinking it was usually about Justine. If he was still so tormented by her and loving her how could he fall for Lottie. I guess I like to read the books where the hero just can't remember life before the heroine - Fiction I guess ",3.0
" I would actually give this a book a 3.5 because I read it in one day so it held my interest but there were several things which did ultimately detract from my overal enjoyment of the book. Also I'm comparing it to the standard that Ms. Medeiros has shown herself capable of in earlier works. I did like the hero and the heroine. Their interactions were fun flirty and laced with sexual tension. I felt that Lottie stayed true to her character as she was initially portrayed in A Kiss to Remember. When Hayden wasn't busy being dark and tortured and staying away from anyhing that could ever bring him happiness he seemed like someone that would attract Lottie. I just felt they didn't spend enough time with each other particularly in that they were living in the same house for most of the book. I prefer romances built on the interaction between the hero and the heroine where as in this case it seemed Lottie had to overcome a lot of other exterior obstacles which did not require her personal involvement with Hayden. I also felt that Ms. Medeiros borrowed from some of her other works to pull this book together notably The Fairest of Them All (ghost haunting the relationship) and Charming the Prince (winning over the daughter.) While I enjoyed this book I just feel it fell short of the kind of writing seen in Heather and Velvet or A Whisper of Roses. I think I'm going to reread one of those to remind myself of the greatness Ms. Medeiros has shown in the past. ",3.0

" I'm a big Teresa Medeiros fan but this is not one of her best books. The two protagonists barely talk for 3/4s of the book but they manage to fall in love...? I read to the end but I wasn't enjoying this read as much I did Yours Until Dawn or the Devil Wears Plaid. ",3.0
" This novel started off with so much promise. Lottie on the night of her debut in society climbs out of her window to steal a peek at a scandalous neighbor. Hayden the neighbor mistakes Lottie for a courtesan that his friend sent him and steals her into his home for some action. Ultimately the two end up compromised and soon are married.I giggled quite a bit at Lottie's antics and the banter the two exchanged. I rather liked how smitten Hayden seemed with his young mischievous wife. Obviously I understood he had a 'tortured soul' as we're filled in that he's been involved with scandal... he's previous wife had supposedly had an affair the lover murdered in a duel and she ended up dead as well. I was curious about his past and hopeful to read the coming story where I expected Lottie to heal the wounded hero.Once Lottie and Hayden make their way to his family home in the country the novel took a sharp dip down. A bratty child is introduced into the story and the entire story seems to revolve around her. Lottie and Hayden don't speak to each other much interact much... and when they do he's such a stick in the mud that I found myself getting frustrated with page after page of Lottie and the kid doing lessons and grumpy Hayden lurching around in the background.When I started to get bored my mind wandered to the beginning that I had liked so much and started to pick it apart. Like wondering how believable it was that a twenty-one year old woman would climb out of her window and go exploring on the night of her debut. And then her other antics seemed silly and immature as well. She was written like a teenage girl. Bah. Just not for me.As the book progressed to the end and the pages on the right grew sparse and the couple STILL had not become intimate I just got tired of it all. Overall just an OK historic romance.Plot themes",3.0
" Medeiros always incorporates an enticing darkness that makes her novels more heartfelt and realistic. The problem with this novel for me was the lack of deep love and devotion between the two protagonists. I wouldn't have noticed this if it weren't for clear undying link we witnessed between the marquiss and his dead wife. Even after he proclaimed his love to Carlotta it was still understood that he retained love for his first wife. Although his undying love for his first wife is admirable I was hoping that the love for his second wife would have surpassed that of his first. The novel was about the love between Lottie and Hayden not the love of Hayden and Justine. Justine's presence in the novel was obviously important in regard to the slaying of Hayden's as well as Allegra's personal demons but it should have been second to the growing love between Hayden and Carlotta. ",3.0
" I expected a little more based upon the reviews but overall this book was an average read. I thought the premise of the forced marriage to be a little bit of a leap simply because I couldn't see the logic in Lottie's family insisting that a supposed murderer Hayden marry Lottie in order to save her image among the ton. Maybe it's just me but I would think that having men with ill intentions try to win Lottie a considerable step above marrying someone who reportedly murdered his wife. If it were my family I would hope that they would rather see me alive.Nevertheless I was able to suspend reality somewhat because it often makes for a great read. I loved Lottie's spirit and curious nature in the beginning. I thought some of her spirit went out of her as the book moved on probably because she was no longer being supported by a loving family and instead had to be the support of a very doom and gloom household. Despite the somewhat somber setting of the book the author maintains a light tone throughout the book which was a welcome relief.I really didn't care for the paranormal activity. Ghosts wandering in rooms cloying scents from dead ones and a sense that closure is complete only when the ghost leaves really goes against the grain for me. I also didn't care for the minimal interactions between Lottie and Hayden. A good portion of the book was spent on Hayden's daughter Allegra and the mystery of Justine Hayden's first wife. So I was left with a little less romance than I would like although I did like the one love scene. However the romance didn't last long and the two had to overcome her novel-writing. I personally thought this a rather unnecessary problem between the two since the reader is very aware that Lottie does not think of Hayden as a murderer and instead is simply writing a fiction novel. I would have much rather seen the pages put towards the two falling in love. I never got the Aha! moment where I felt that the two fell in love or were falling in love. It was extremely difficult as their interactions with each other largely centered around the child rather than one another.Given all this the book still managed to keep my attention throughout. So while I don't think the book was that great if you're a Medeiros fan then maybe it's worth it to pick up a copy. If not then I would pick it up at the library or skip it altogether. ",3.0
" I have read all Medeiros books now. I became a fan after Fairest of Them All (she named Holly after my coworker Lisa's daughter and is from my area). This book is good but it is not phenomenal like I was hoping.Medeiros seems to recycle the same devices in her stories in every book. There is always a strong-bodied tortured man with a title and a scar on him that is dangerous and provocative and makes him more handsome than boyish (he never has a good relationship with his father). The heroine is always a rebellious and witty virgin with big dreams who is trying to discover her sensuality. There is always a sham marriage that comes from some scandal or rebellion. Every single time. The heroine is always warned to stay away from her 'husband' as he tends to be disreputable in some way or the other but she always melts his heart. There are always precocious children and acting pets (usually cats). There is always a motherly head maid in the castle of the tortured man. There is always a weary castle that the heroine takes responsibility over and transforms into its former glory. She is never raised by her actual parents there is always some tragic story of their deaths or disappearance. Magical realism (like the ghost of the previous wife in the end) is always included.My point is if I had not read ANY other Medeiros novels (my two favorites being Yours Until Dawn and Fairest of Them All) then I would give this a 5 star rating. But I cannot give it anymore than 3 because I've seen it before. I do love the sequel concept. She is also using this device again with the two latest books Some Like it Wicked and Some Like it Wild. But now she is trending towards Scottish pride and Highlander rogues. I'm just giving an honest opinion. I love Medeiros I LOVE ALL OF HER WORK but I need to see more than this as a follower. I've seen this before. A LOT now.It is worth the read to any new Medeiros fans though. Just makes sure you read A Kiss to Remember first. It will help out a lot even though you don't really NEED to. This story holds its own and is well worth the read. ",3.0

" You know the Amityville freak that I am I have to say that although the producers of this movie had the right idea it just didn't scare me the way the first and even the second Amityville movies did. One thing that was lacking in the 3-D movie here was the fact that much if not all of the movie was taking place during the daytime. The first Amityville movie featured frightening hauntings strange voices and eerie occurences in the early early morning hours(between 2-4 A.M.) which are creepy hours to begin with. And I also felt that the fly scenes are a bit old by now it's time after the first and second movies to start with some newer and different types of hauntings. The only time I felt that the movie did start to pick up was near the end the last twenty minutes or so in the basement which I won't give away. But I will say that it went on late at night which is when the majority of the movie's spooky occurences should've taken place. The basement of that house was always to me the downright scariest damn part of the house. On the plus side I will give the producers of the movie credit for using the exact same house for this movie as the original movie used. Because if you're going to make an Amityville movie it helps immensely to use the exact same house. And another scene that I felt was REALLY REALLY chilling(and made me feel as though the story is finally about to pick up) is when Lori Loughlin(the daughter of the home owner in this movie who is beautiful as always) goes out onto the lake with her friends on the boat that's tied to the dock in the back of the house. But I also won't give away what happens there. It is worth taking a look at if you're an Amityville freak like me but if you haven't seen any Amityville movies yet watch the original Amityville movie FIRST. And watch it on DVD. The color has been restored so greatly on the DVD it's unbelievable. And watch it late at night between 1-4 a.m. for the best chilling effects. 'Amityville 2",3.0
" This actually was not intended to be a sequel to The Amityville Horror just a 3D movie that put a new spin of the Amityville story. It was named Amityville 3 or whatever in Europe by the over seas distributer to cash n on the amityville series name. Just as Lucio Fulci's movie Zombie was named Zombie 2 in Europe because Dawn of the dead had been named zombie over there and the distributers tried to cash in on the enormous success it was.Anyway Amityville 3D was eventually taken into consideration as a part of the series later on when they made amityville 4 since that movie had nothing to do with the series either and after that every movie was just separate story taking place in the Amityville house. So therefore none of the amityville movies after part two are really sequels considering a sequel continues directly an ongoing story and none of these do.I give this movie 3 stars even though I have never watched the entire thing in one sitting because it was rather lame but it was somewhat inventive and I could tell that a lot of it would be better in it's original 3D format in the theaters rather than on video.

Otherwise you have to go beyond the director's cheesy attempts to startle an 80's 3-D viewing public. (The DVD of the film is 3-D in title alone.) It has a few surprises so it's worth watching if you have a free afternoon. Otherwise this is largely considered the first in a long line of unnecessary sequels to the Amityville franchise. ",3.0

" This book focuses primarily on the author's high school years and it's a rough read in places. At a young age she had to navigate a lot of danger and a lot of adult irrationality. I think it's important that books like this are written and the world would be a safer place if victims of every sort of abuse were willing or able to drag their story out into the light. Abusers love a 'shameful' secret.That said 'Jesus Land' suffers from a few obvious problems that make me question how balanced the book is.First almost every adult in the story is painted as either a cruel idiot or just an idiot. It reminded me of the eighties film 'The Breakfast Club' where all of the kids were intelligent nuanced and sincere but the school principal was a one-dimensional unthinking monster who needed to be defeated. It isn't just the adults though - almost the entire adolescent population of Lafayette Indiana in the early eighties were apparently idiot hicks too.There is also very little concession to the reality that to everyone around her she probably appeared to make consistently horrible and dangerous choices. If my teenage daughter was drinking Southern Comfort on a regular basis tanking at school and sneaking a guy that she didn't even particularly like into her bedroom every night to have sex a few flags might go up. I don't believe that the right solution was to ship her to reform school in the Dominican Republic but she was well on her way to being an alcoholic teenage mother with no education and a venereal disease. I can sort of empathize with her parents on this count even if they were making some equally poor choices (with only half of the relevant information).Personally I found some of her treatment of Christianity to be gratuitously and deliberately offensive here and there. It's her book but that was my reaction and I found it very distracting.Beyond all of that I felt that the author sometimes confused immodesty with transparency. Consequently we are treated to some rather weird details about her life and perceptions that contribute nothing to her story but made me want to scrub my brain with bleach. We all have those details but few of us publish them. Decorum isn't all bad.I have actually been to Escuela Caribe (hence my interest in Scheeres' story) - not as a student but as a visitor for several days.

" I've seen very few of the Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce Sherlock Holmes films so I wasn't sure what to expect. I did enjoy this short film. Holmes and Watson have been hired to guard a famous jewel called the Star of Rhodesia a diamond that has caused no end of problems for its many previous owners. Most of the film takes place aboard a speeding train bound for Scotland a scenario ripe with possibilities due to the confined space and lack of possible escape. Various characters are aboard opening up many chances for robbery and as it turns out murder as well. Rathbone and Bruce are of course classics in this genre and after so many turns as these characters there performances seem effortless. The supporting cast is fine as well and there is enough action to more than keep the viewer's attentions. It's obvious not much money was spent on the film and the absence of music at key events is felt but this mystery remains entertaining nonetheless. ",3.0

In route the jewel is taken and people are murdered.

Even after hearing who was the thief I still couldn't see how. There was too much of a jump for me to believe.Still following Holmes as he goes through the mystery is exciting.

" As an avid Teresa Medeiros fan I couldn't resist picking up 'Yours Until Dawn.' I was very unfortunately disappointed. The story was almost TOO predictable which tends to take a lot out of the story for me and the 'plot twist' was completely obvious --- in fact because I saw it so immediatley and it's been so overused I REALLY wanted Medeiros to surprise me and turn the other way around. When she didn't I found myself excessively disappointed. I've become so used to Medeiros taking a common type of story and twisting it around to make it her own and this just wasn't up to her usual standard.Still as usual her writing style is engaging and her characters --- with the exception of the very obvious herione who was ruined for me --- were intriguing at least. In spite of its banality the way Medeiros told her story was still fun to read. The 'battle of wills' was certainly enjoyable --- a will battle as only Teresa Medeiros can write one.

I found many of the situations hard to believe and I felt that Samanthas 'secret' was extremely obvious - I wasnt at all shocked when it was revealed.This book wasnt awful...I did enjoy some of its secondary characters and I would love to see a story written about Gabriels friend Martin Worth.All in all not a bad read but not a keeper.

" I liked this book but I didn't love it. The relationship between Gabriel and Samantha was really satisfying until the ridiculous way he regained his sight intruded. Then there was a tangle of misunderstandings and the typical 'I'm not good enough' response from Samantha. As one of the other reviewers said I too wish that he had made the ultimate declaration before he heard the whole story. ",3.0
" ...but TM disappointed me in the end. Up until then I was loving the story even though I figured out the 'twist' very early on. I won't spoil the story but suffice it to say that Gabriel does something toward the end that makes a mockery of his love for Samantha and I was so distraught that I nearly couldn't finish it. So five stars for most of the book one star for the last part and I went with the average. 'Charming the Prince' is a much more satisfying read by this author. ",3.0

" I guess I'm another odd one out because I thought the book was o.k. but I wouldn't read it again. I certainly didn't love it & I'm not really sure I can even say that I actually liked it. This is the 2nd book I've read from Teresa Medeiros & I will read more because the book Nobody's Darling was excellent. Along with the romance in books I also enjoy a little mystery & suspense & there just wasn't any in this book. It was just a little too slow to me & there wasn't much excitement. If a nice slow romance without any adventure is what you enjoy then certainly give it a try but if you want more then just a plan slow romance then find another read. ",3.0
" Teresa Medeiros shot straight to the top of my auto-buy list the moment I read 'A Kiss to Remember'. Her backlist has ultimately charmed me but her recent Avon releases; One Night of Scandal and this one have fallen way short of the TM charm.This book had plenty of promise; a beauty and the beast type premise(though The Bride and the Beast used it as well) a blind tortured hero and a no-nonsense heroine. But it began to unravel fairly quickly after the first meeting between the hero and heroine. Gabriel came across as less of a tortured 'dark' hero and more of a petulant man whose care-free life was changed simply because he wasn't handsome anymore. Samantha was a great character up until the twist Medeiros put into the book(which btw I didn't see coming *g*).The cartoonish servants(why oh why are servants in Regency historicals so darn friendly?) love scenes that were watered down versions of Medeiros' previous sensual richly emotional love scenes of her past books and a last section that erased all of the charm and wit of the majority of the book and sadly I found myself regretting that I'd bought this book instead of waiting for my library to obtain it.

" Even though the premise of the book is rather formulaic (Gee I wonder what happens when a dashing but wounded serviceman is nursed by a lovely young woman hmm?) I did enjoy the surly earl and could understand that it is not unreasonable for him to behave in that manner being that it was only 6 months since the initial injury. However I'm going to have to go with the minority on this one. I enjoy plot twists and am actually quite pleased when I am surprised. However as I closed in on the middle of the book a nagging suspicion crept in and all I kept thinking was 'please no.' It was an unfortunate yes and that tidbit was quite disappointing. I would have been fine if the storyline stayed the course and avoided that 'twist'. Anything but the conclusion that it was.If I could remove a couple elements of the book I'd give it 4.5 stars. The writing was well done. I could imagine the mustiness of the air the dark cavernous ambiance of the rooms and the beastly earl and his growls. I came to like the earl and the servants. But the twist took away from all that. And for that I give this 3 stars. ",3.0
" I love beauty and the beast themed novels so the idea of a woman nursing a blind war hero back to the land of the living was wonderful. I loved that he learned to deal with his disablity while falling in love with the heroine. Then bam! The whole plot switches. It was almost like two different books. I can't go into too much with out giving everthing away but everything that was presented a certain way was not actually true. The hero claims to love the heroine but lusts after a woman he says he hates while loving heroine.(This will make sense if you read it) I adored the first half of the book. It was shaping up to be one of my all time favorites. Then the author makes you second guess who the characters really are. Do we really know them after all? The author also took the easy way out with the heroes disability. Overall this book is worth reading from the library but not worthy of paying for. I wish I had just skipped the last 40 pages. Even though it ended happily it left a bad taste in my mouth. ",3.0
" This book had all the ingredients to make a good read yet something was missing. I love a suffering hero spunky heroine colorful secondary cast of characters and an intriguing plot - and this novel had all of the above. Still...it didn't have the ability to pull me into the book and join their world. Somehow I remained a bystander skeptically watching the drama enfold but never tempted to invest myself in their story - despite my best efforts.Perhaps it was the timing. Certain aspects of the story seemed rushed not given enough time for the ingredients to blend. Seems like the `beast' is tamed much too quickly. Seems like they are attracted to each other without any real reason except proximity. Seems like the hero's family is introduced only to further the plot. Just didn't seem quite realistic.Starts out with our hero blinded and scarred in a naval battle embittered and reclusive who retreats to his country estate to wallow in self-pity and despair. Enter the heroine a nurse hired by his father to replace the succession of caretakers before her who have quit in disgust anger or fear. The household servants have abandoned their household duties and the estate is unkempt matching their master's foul temper. So far so good.Enter the new nurse determined to ease his circumstances in spite of his reluctance. Before you know it she has rearranged the house enlisted the help of the servants tamed the beast and is enormously attracted to the hero. There is no slow sizzling build up of sensual tension no real getting acquainted no suspense. Admittedly there were a great deal of opportunities for the story to develop and simmer but it just didn't.And then from nowhere his family arrives. I found it impossible to discern if the family was loving cruel grieving or aggrieved. Did they love him or were they simply embarrassed by the encumbrance he created for them? Frankly I didn't much care. They were introduced to create a scene - and they did. At which point the hero stumbles out of doors (blind don't forget) by himself and wanders off into the woods. I know this is a novel - but some plot devices are entirely too ridiculous and this was one. And it got even more unbelievable as the scene unfolded.I would not have finished the book except so many other reviewers mentioned they didn't like the ending. My curiosity won and I finished the book. Oddly I found the final third of the book delightful. I won't give it away but the ending was clever and quite skillful. If only the first two-thirds had been the same.....Sorry overall 3 stars barely - and only because of the ending. ",3.0
" This story was very good up to a point. Medeiros did very well with the 'tortured hero that's saved by the love of the right woman' theme. Gabriel was a wonderfully developed male lead definately swoon worthy. And Samantha was really good at putting him in his place when needed and giving him care and understanding when needed. But here's a teensy spoiler... there is just the DUMBEST most contrived twist at the end and it pretty much ruined my enjoyment of the story. It totally ruined what was turning out to be a beautifully contructed relationship between Gabriel and Samantha. To read something by Medeiros at her best I suggest checking out 'Charming the Prince.' ",3.0
" Teresa Medeiros if one of my favorite authors. Often her novels ring with powerful emotion. Occasionally she does miss the mark. I enjoyed this book but it's not my favorite. While I liked both of the characters and though the author did a wonderful job of writing I never became emotionally attached to the lead characters.Samantha's secret actually detracted from the book for me. Her transformation did not ring true. Actually it was only as her secret began to unfold that I became uneasy with the story. I had really enjoyed the book until then but at that point it became too easy too pat a resolution.It's a good book but flawed in my opinion. ",3.0
" Yours Until Dawn by Teresa Medeiros is a quiet read there's just enough excitement to keep you turning the pages. Samantha the nurse tries to help Gabriel the aristocrat learn to live with the blindness caused by his war wounds. Everybody's likeable and it's all pretty predictable but the story doesn't really suffer because of it. It is a mild tale of discovery and overcoming life's obstacles. This is one of those tales where things go pretty smoothly from bad to better with fairy tale ease. The story lacks the gritty feel of reality which makes it perfect for those times when you've had enough reality and just want to spend a quiet afternoon with a book. ",3.0
" I got these on closeout a while back and I was pretty impressed. The expander feature is definitely a plus and it does allow you to put significantly more gear in your bag than you otherwise could. The rain covers are pretty much only good if your bike is sitting still since they don't really seem to latch on or tie down in any way. Another small gripe that I have is that it doesn't seem like I can really get the bags close enough together to properly fit over the tail of my bike. Granted I have a sport bike with a pretty narrow tail but it just always looks as if the bags are permanently sagging. These bikes have the integrated clips for the Fieldsheer Tail Bag however that product was discontinued so I can't really recommend these bags. If you're looking for something in the same price range that will do the job just as good and is still being supported I'd check out the Cortech Sport bags instead. However if you only want the saddle bags and you want something that works reasonably well these do the job. ",3.0
" Sure just another book that on one hand tells us that only a small minority of Quaker 'fanatics' were abolitionists and that the war was over expansion and not slavery and then the next minute have us all believe that Union troops faught and died to end slavery when in many of their hometowns there were laws that forbid blacks Indians and mulatooes from staying in town after sundown. If you believe that people died for this then you need to be reading bedtime stories. The war was fought over MONEY POWER and caused by disagreement between Constitutional Federalists and Jeffersonians. Even the Supreme Court ruled that secession was allowed under the Constitution (in 1862 I believe) but in their ruling said basically that 'this is our ruling but to no avail because the issue is being decided on the battlefields as we speak'.

" A Wu Shu western a la the old TV series 'Kung Fu.' Seeing Jet Li after being taken in by American Indians wearing pig tails on either side of his head and running up the front of his shirt is something everyone should see. The problem with this film is that the best fight scenes involve Clubfoot now known as 'Seven.' Sammo Hung's directorial style has never been a favorite of mine (see 'Mr. Nice Guy' and all the slo-mo action there) and this just reinforces that perception.... ",3.0
" Not the best in the series but worth buying if you want to complete the set. I thought the series started to wane with OUATIC III but it actually picks up a bit with this one.ClubFoot reappears (now known as 'Seven') puts on a fantastic display of martial arts. In fact the scenes of Jet Li and Seven fighting Native Americans Cowboys and each other make this film worth watching. What is a bit disappointing is the end fight; rather corny and very predictable.

" Well on the outside it would appear that Jet Li had made a triumphant return to the series that made his career. In reality this sequel falls short of the glory of the past titles. You should know that Jet Li was replaced for Once Upon a Time in China 4 and 5. (This being the sixth) Those movies were also very much below the quality of the first two. I suppose this movie does a better job than the Vincent Zhao vehicles that are OUATIC 4 and 5 but not by much. I must say these movies are very similar. I can tell you this the storyline deals with the whole fish out of water ordeal. The big twist in this movie is that Jet Li bangs his head on a rock and thinks he is a native american indian. Then with some coaxing from his friend Clubfoot (read",3.0
" So Sammo Hung decided to put his name into the history books by making the last Wong Fei-Hung movie starring Jet Li. The movie starts off with Wong Clubfoot and Aunt 13 travelling across America to go visit Bucktooth at his new Po Chi Lam school. Wong befriends a man named Billy and they become good friends even though they can't speak eachother's language. Billy loves everything abouth the Chinese once he meets them especially their fighting skills. During an attack the group gets split up and Wong hits his head on a rock and loses his memory. He knows how to do everything he did before but he just doesn't know who he is or remember anythign liek that. So Wong lives with Indians for a while before Clubfoot finally reminds Master Wong who he is. As an injected subplot there are robbers who Master Wong Clubfoot and Billy have to take on in the final fight.Overall I was pretty dissapointed in this movie but it still had enough good moments to recommend it to people who have seen the other 4 Wong Fei-Hung films with Jet Li. The movie just really doesn't know what it wants to be. Some parts are over violent and while that wouldn't be so bad Jet Li and everybody else can't make a single movement without it being wire assisted. This does become bothersome but luckily Sammo slows down on it as the movie moves along. As expected in a Sammo movie it is hilarious at times but they should have made it just a comedy or a very serious movie and not tried to have a perfect blend of everything becasue they do anythign but. The final fight is good but still below standards of other movies in this series even the hard to watch #3.Also this movie has to be the best showcase for Xin Xin Xiong ever right up there with 'Hero of Heroes'. Sadly he doesn't do much in the final fight but it is still a rare showcase for him. Truly one of the best or would have been if he could have gotten more of a chance.The version I have of this movie is from China Star Entertainment Group and also has the name of Win's Entertainment group on it. The DVD is somewhat dissapointing with slightly below average picture quality and subtitles that constantly show up 5 seconds after the person has spoken making the dialogue very hard to follow. There is a 30 minute making of on the DVD and even though most of it is is Chinese about 7 minutes are interviews with Americans and overall it is very fun to watch. ",3.0
" Wong Fei Hung (Jet Li) comes to the states with his ever present love interest Auntie Yee (the delectable Rosamund Kwan) only to be lost in some white water rapids rendering him an amnesiac and adopted by Indians. His entourage begin searching for him but are limited by the fact that they're Asians in the old West. Sammo Hung returned to directing after a long unsuccessful period with this film. If upon viewing the film seems familiar it's because it was actually an early version of the recent Jackie Chan film 'Shanghai Noon.' I'm not calling Hung a rip off artist as he's one of the most prolific successful and highly regarded Hong Kong directors of all time but story has it that Hung after a long streak of unsuccessful films took the basic story as his own when Jackie Chan told him of his long time desire to make a modern Western. Perhaps Hung did this due to the fact that he and Jackie had a falling out in the mid 80's which was only recently mended (the proof is the Sammo Hung directed MR. NICE GUY). But even though Hung may have gotten the idea from Chan you can't deny he did a good job with it. Hung is a much better and capable director in my opinion than Chan and has been for a long time but for some reason Chan has managed to outshine not only Hung but also Hong Kong superstars like Yuen Biao. For those of you not in the know Chan Biao and Hung were all 'brothers' at the Peking Opera School all were trained torturously in martial arts acrobats acting and stunt work. As for Once...in America it's not the best Jet Li movie but it is a lot less sillier and the fights more intricate than most Jet Li films which are mainly period pieces and involve an embarrasingly large amount of wire work (as witness Tai Chi Master and most of the other Once upon a time films). Hung proves himself once again to be a very talented director as well as fight choreographer but if you really want to see a great Sammo Hung film check out PEDICAB DRIVER MILLIONAIRE'S EXPRESS or WHEELS ON MEALS all with Sammo's special brand of razor sharp intricate martial artistry.

" HELL AND HIGH WATER(1954) Directed and Written by Samuel Fuller. Scipt by Jesse Kasky Jr. Make up by Ben Nye. Score by Alfred Newman. Special effects by Ray Kellogg.Starring Richard Widmark Bella Darvi Cameron Mitchell Richard Loo Henry Kulky Gene Evans David Wayne and Victor Francen.A private group of scientists hire a crew former American navy men to pilot a surplus Japanese submarine to investigate North Atlantic islands believed to have a Red--aka Red Chinese--atomic base. In spite of a variety of troubles from Red opposition to having a woman onboard the crew discover that there is indeed a Red Atomic base they have an American B-52 an nuclear bomb and a monstrous plan to discredit the United States. Can --and should--the crew do anything to stop them.......or should they just report it to the appropriate authorities??Though Sam Fuller has the reputation of being some cinematic genius I have never thought so finding his film interesting and watchable but almost always lumpy underdone and not as good as they would be if a less exalted director had handled the material. And it is pretty much the same here.There is a great concept here more than one excellent sequence and/or moments the score is superb and the special effects consistently effective and more than a little jawdropping(see the oil dump battle sequence). The film has the feel of the Men's adventure magazines of that period. The battle sequences are all good. Unfortunately as this is Fuller we have to take our lumps and our underdone potatoes. The script is too talky by ten minutes and should have been trimmed. Much of this tallkiness is taken up with the always trying 'broad on a sub plot' which is worse here considering what is at state. While I know Darryl Zanuck was stumpfing Darvi and Fuller was stuck with her there comes a time in every action/adventure film where you stick da broad in the background and let the men take over. Fuller never does constantly allowing the Darvi plot to intrude upon the main plot thus never letting it build up steam. Fuller's dialogue was never his strong point in any case and his idea of humor is turgid. The film needed to be a tight 80/90 minutes instead it lumbers far too long at 103.As such the actors never quite get to come alive. Mitchell's character is impossible and he can do nothing with it. Evans and Wayne might just as well not be in the picture being gloried extras. As an actress Darvi made for excellent w ore for Zanuck. Widmark is okay in an underwritten part as is Francen.The film is not bad and has much to recommend but oh for a Don Siegal of an F. Lee Thompson................Incidentally the Chinese did not have the A Bomb in 1954 so one must assume that this was actually a Soviet operation using the Chinese as their operatives...........The film IS also of interest since the basic plot is not all that different from some of the later Bond films--particularly OCTOPUSSY.....and is probably the first time it was used.....Oh and while the DVD print is gorgeous it is the prime example of how letterboxing can kill a film. It is like looking through a mail slot!!! ",3.0

" I bought this album becoming hopeful that i would hear an ALL ORIGINAL KISS album (like Rock and Roll Over) and as it turns out the original members played on only 3 tracks. The remaining tracks are quite good but lack the 'swagger' and 'charisma' of Ace and Peter's contributions. For that it becomes just another KISS record to me. I suppose that's what makes Alive! such a great recording.This most especially holds true for Peter Criss. Anyone who has doubts to the man's capability and timing should listen to Into The Void or 100000 years on ALIVE! That is (for me) one the the first (and best) heavy metal drum solos of all time.Believe it (3)! ",3.0
" Kiss' Psycho Circus--their eighteenth studio album--was released in 1998. Ten tracks are contained. The material is in a straight-ahead hard rock musical direction. Overall I find the songwriting to be satisfying the musicianship to be tight and the sound quality to be crisp. My favorite songs are 'Psycho Circus' 'Within' and 'Into the Void.' The hard-driving 'Psycho Circus' displays propulsive vocals from Paul Stanley. 'Within' is a tough-sounding interesting tune with versatile industrious vocals from Gene Simmons and appealing guitar work--especially the aggressive central guitar riff. 'Into the Void' is a vigorous one that sports cool ambitious vocals from Ace Frehley and nice rhythm guitar playing. An example of another cut that I like is the energy-filled 'You Wanted the Best'--lead vocals are split between Stanley Simmons Frehley and Peter Criss. The CD foldout includes the song lyrics. The disc is just over 44 minutes. Psycho Circus is a recommendable piece of work. ",3.0
" When I heard that the original band were going to record their first album in 19 years(the last being 1979's disaster 'Dynasty') I couldn't think about nothing else. When I heard the title track 'Psycho Circus' during the summer of '98 I was so pumped. I recorded it off the radioand played it over & over again. When the day it was released I had my wife stop by the cd store & get it. I could barely stay below the speed limit on the way home from work. I popped it in the cd player & rocked out.

" `Psycho Circus' is not the first nor was it the last fraud perpetrated on KISS fans by the firm of Stanley and Simmons. A reunion album may have turned into a great idea but Ace and Peter are little more than special guests on this LP. The album itself tries too hard to capture the glory years of the seventies with two unbelievably embarrassing songs that quality control should have prevented from appearing (I won't tell you which two because once you hear the songs (look at the titles) it will instantly be obvious. It is also that the original KISS toured in support of this record (man Ace and Peter must have been paid a ton!) since the band was not technically a band by this point. Bruce Fairbairn was less than enamored with the playing of Frehley and Criss that session people (including future KISS lead guitarist Tommy Thayer) played almost all the songs (Ace's 'Into the Void' being the lone tune that all four members actually played on). The liner notes won't tell you that but how many times have bands lied on their liner notes (especially KISS!)? The title track and 'I Pledge Allegiance' are decent even good KISS songs and the aforementioned Ace song is worthwhile. I also like 'Within' which as one reviewer has already mentioned seems like an obvious `Carnival of Souls' leftover. I haven't heard `Sonic Boom' but seeing how `Psycho Circus' was the last real KISS album for over a decade I don't have high hopes. As Gene has made fairly obvious on his TV show KISS is now more than ever a corporate brand and not a productive artistic rock band (it is hard to believe Gene made his fame and fortune as a musician not as a carnival huckster). Longtime fans may enjoy `Psycho Circus' but then they already know the deal...welcome to the show...a true masquerade... ",3.0
" If Kiss really wanted to obey their fans wishes then why didn't Peter and Ace appear on the whole album. It's not like the material on here is so complex that they couldn't handle it. The fans really wanted a new album from the original four. But half the fans guessed what would happen and they were right. But lets go through the tracks.1. Psycho Circus- I really like this song a lot. Awesome opener. Very true to the Kiss style of fun rock songs.2. Within- My favorite track on the album. Being a fan of the revious Kiss lineup this is very reminiscent of Revenge or Carnival of Souls. Very dark and heavy.3. I Pledge Alleigence- Another good and fun rocker from Stanley. Thank God the lyrics are not over the top cheese. Once again a true Kiss rock song.4. Into the Void- This one comes from my favorite Kiss member. Ace could always write cool songs and this is another one. New ground really is not explored but it's Ace what more do you want.5. We Are One-O.K. This is where we start going downhill. I'm sorry is this Kiss or Hootie and the Blowfish. This song should not have made it to the final cut. They should have used another Ace or one of the Peter songs. Oh yeah they voted Peter's songs out. Instead we have 'We are One'. Ugh!6. You Wanted the Best- Yeah I did but I got this instead. One star gets deleted just because of the fact that they wrote a song called You Wanted the Best You got the Best. CHEESE. I will say that the lyrics are not as bad as they could have been and the tune itself is decent but still look at the title.(hanging my head in disbelief).7. Raise Your Glasses- This one is another song that should not have been here. It's not horrible but it has no edge to it. Something else should have been here.8. I Finally Found My Way- Paul wrote it and Peter sang it. It would have ben better if Peter had a rockin song to sing. In my opinion this song could have been better. 9. Dreamin- Not only is this a ripoff of 'I'm Eighteen' they also ripoff 'I Want You' at the end. This isn't the first time Kiss has ripped themselves off. Revenge contains riffs from The Elder and Unmasked. This song is very mediocre. Could have been replaced.10. Journey of 1000 Years- Is this a good song. Yes!. Should it have been on the new Kiss album with the original members. No! I love this song but Gene is the demon again where did that demon spirit go. I guess it's gone.I find it interesting that Peter only played on one song. Into The Void. I'm not sure if Frehley played on the whole thing I read where he said he did not. I believe him. This album sounds a little to mixed up. It is not a complete Kiss album sounds like someones idea of what a Kiss album should be. Very disappointing. ",3.0

" Kiss has everything a band can ask for. Loyal fans great producers to work with outstanding stage presence and an over the top show that is second to none. They lack the ablity to write great songs or play with any musical talent... this record is no different. This was the last studio record from Kiss although they have been touring for the last 7 years since its release.As for this cd it has its moments. The title track might be one of the best Kiss songs to date. Within' and We Are One are also great tracks. Dreamin' is a complete rip off of Alice Coopers 'I'm 18' Into the Void I Pledge Allegiance to the State of Rock and Roll and I Finally Found My Way are just plain bad. Skip those tracks at all cost.

" Okay enough is enough and please take this one for what it is instead of who played what what sounds like what who sounds like who and whats missing etc cause after all we have been blessed by firstly the Reunion Tour and secondly the fantastic gift of one more studio release..and its meant to be and is FUN!! This CD is nothing more or nothing less than something extra to savour as the end draws near for this great band. Things open big time with the title track 'Psycho Circus' which is one of two songs on here truely deserving 'classic' status signed sealed and delivered with a Kiss. Gene's 'Within' is maybe oddly placed second up but its a sleeper and after a few listens your hooked and yes it does sound like a Carnival of Souls era song but surely thats to be expected as that CD proceeded this one! We should expect in my opinion that the band members will pull from their vast musical backgrounds at this point in their career. 'I Pledge Allegiance' is a big slab of bubblegum fun that Paul can write in his sleep take it or leave it. Classic number two roars out of the gates with 'Into The Void'  thumbs up to Space Ace! The Convention Tour perhaps was the seed for 'We Are One' next up by Gene which is a kind of acoustic ditty which is near on impossible not to hum along to. I don't really have feelings one way or the other for 'You Wanted The Best' though the shared vocals by all four is fun making it worth the time. 'Raise Your Glasses' is like a sister song to 'Pledge..' and is as good. Peter does a ballad in 'I Finally Found My Way'... and I'm standing on a box now... and do I have everybodies attention cause...I LOVE IT! So there! 'Dreamin' is vintage vocals from Paul and the closer 'Journey' is way cool almost Elder like with refrains back to 'Within' and 'Psycho Circus' all of which reminds me a little of 'Only You' and 'Odyssey' from the one and only concept album from the masked ones! Now I admit this CD is a little varied in stylesor eclectic if you've swallowed a dictionary and in some ways comes over like a Best of the Solo Albums deal but really who gives a toss 'cause at least its new and its got a square case that has a Kiss logo on it and everybody in the band has a star turn something I've waited for for a long time!

" The original 'Gods of Thunder' are back with their first collaborative (?) studio work in years. I question the collaboration because each song seems to be the creation of an individual member. We don't hear backing vocals from anyone except Gene on songs where Gene is the lead singer. And if Paul sings lead we only hear Paul singing backup. KISS fans want to hear KISS not the solo albums re-hashed! The exception on 'Psycho Circus' is the song 'You Wanted the Best' where each band member takes pot shots at the others. Well if Psycho Circus was their best then their best just isn't good enough! 'Within' comes close to being a good song with its crunching guitar twists and turns and riffs played backwards. Unfortunately Peter and Ace are kept in a little corner as they were with all previous KISS albums. Here they are allowed to deliver one song each. Peter is forced to sing a horrible 'Beth' clone called 'I Finally Found My Way' instead of cutting loose and screaming his vocals on a big rocker like he did on the best KISS song ever ('Nothin to lose'). Ace rips some catchy riffs on 'Into the Void' but the lyrics are so idiotic that I have trouble listening to the song! During their first run KISS built on a foundation rock and roll and marketing to evolve into a big overhyped money making machine. With Psycho Circus they appear to want to skip the actual musical portion go directly to the marketing and overhype. ",3.0
" 'and the if-Green-Day-can-do-it-why-not-us acoustic surprise 'We Are One.'Why on Earth would you compare Kiss with Green Day? These four guys had it down before Green Day was even a wet stain on the map 35 years ago there is absolutely no comparison because Green Day are a PUNK BAND. ",3.0
" This CD has some of thier best songs on it and some of the worst songs. For the most part this is a worthy effort but songs like 'Raise your Glasses' 'I Finally Found My Way To You' & 'You Wanted The Best' just sound too hokey and calculated. Think about it",3.0
" It safe to say that Paul and Gene are responsible for most of what Kiss records. What gets my attention is that that there is probably more than one Ace Frehley running around in New York City. The real Ace has a deep voice and sounds like either Tony Martin of Black Sabbath or Ian Gillan. Tunes like Psycho Circus and Within are distinctavely Ace Frehley's Riffs and Within was sung by all three original members. Bruce Kulick never played in that key with his years in Kiss. The drums are probably from a studio musician which Pete will not credit for. It is doubtful that Eric Singer or the deceased Eric Carr can phathom drumming like that as is evident in often described as a stale Kiss when money and greed dominated the minds of Paul and Gene and left the public wondering as well as their label if any attention was given to their sound. I found the drumming to be one of the highlights of the record along with Peter's ballad. The song Into the Void doesn't sound like Ace Frehley from the seventies. As far as describing themselves musically dead traces can be found as one song is practically a copy from a prior song on the same record as jealously within the group becomes more apparent. It's time for the orinigal four to take their make-up off as a threshold in their careers has been reached and to progress forward as musicians as some progression is demostrated on this LP. ",3.0
" The way I see it after 18 years apart this cd was about what I expected. Not great but a start.The shining moments for me include 'Psycho Circus' 'Into The Void' and 'Raise Your Glasses'.Kiss has never had an all the way thru great studio album and they still do not.You know what though so what?!They still are the greatest live band in the world. All these young punks out there today should take notesKiss is what rock and roll(over)is suppost to be about. No whiners allowedlong live the best KISS! ",3.0
" When you hear the opening bars and vocals of `Psycho Circus' burst out of the speakers for the first time it is a wondrous moment. It sounds like Kiss having reformed the original line-up at the end of the 90s after a decade and a half apart have actually pulled it off. For five minutes and ten seconds of glorious stomping glam rock and roll it feels like they have returned to their heyday form. But alas after this superb classic Kiss opener 1998's `Psycho Circus' somewhat implodes.It would have seemed sensible at this point in their story to employ a producer from their classic heavy period such as Bob Ezrin (`Destroyer' `Revenge') or Larry Kramer (`Rock & Roll Over'). Instead they went with Bruce Fairbairn who had mostly helmed albums for glossy mid rockers like Bon Jovi Aerosmith Poison and Van Halen as well as The Cranberries. Consequently with the Kiss sound on this album augmented by keyboards and effects that would never have appeared on one of their records the first time around the band sounds watered down and over-produced. Then there is the additional problem that too often the songs bear little resemblance to the music they would have made in the 70s.That said none of the songs are terrible. It is also the third Kiss album in a row that showcases strong well-crafted largely non-corny songs from Gene Simmons in a late career renaissance. In fact his are mostly the best of the album - the moody `Within' and `Journey of 1000 Years' are truly fine if unrepresentative of the Kiss sound. And the folksy `We Are One' sounds like it could have been a good track on his 1978 solo album. Though they again fall into the tired trap of trying to re-write `Rock and Roll All Nite' (twice) his version - `You Wanted the Best' is ok (if hokey) for what it is. Paul Stanley's `I Pledge Allegiance to the State of Rock & Roll' is far superior. While Stanley's title track is far and away the best song on the album and `Dreamin' is excellent as well he is also behind a few clunkers. `Raise Your Glasses' written with corporate writer Holly Knight doesn't sit quite right with the set and the Peter Criss voiced `I Finally Found My Way' with its tinkling piano and country crooner leanings is woefully wrong and out of place. On the other hand Ace Frehley's only contribution `Into the Void' is convincing.Sadly though much more satisfying than any of their albums without make-up the bottom line is that `Psycho Circus' was just too unrepresentative and muddled in approach - and too calculated - to resuscitate the glory days.

" This disc was the original lineup back in action.At this time kiss was once again one of the hottest bands in the world.They were always big but in 1996-98 they were at the top and I remember even visiting a college in washington state and seeing students dressed up like them everywhere. This disc had some great songs on it like 'witbin'  'psycho circus'  'you wanted the best' and 'into the void' some of the rest of the songs were not as good and the band was trying to be anthemic and not too hard sounding. This is NOT a terrible disc though by any means. It sold well enough and was enjoyable. The band should have just kept releasing songs and writing like they are now. Just making songs they love without trying to return to destroyer with weaker songs. The German version of this has a great live cd with it that has an incredible live version of 'into the void' on it. The japanese version has a great ace song that should have been on the regular release and s weaker song taken off. Anyways don't believe that this is a bad disc it's not as good as it could have been; but it's good hard rock. It's not in 'Revenge' s class or 'carnival of souls' but it was decent And should have been followed in 2000 by a new album in which everyone really let loose. ",3.0
" I won't go into too much detail in reviewing this album because it's not a favorite of mine to be honest. It could have and should have been so much better. The opening title track was pretty good for the most part. It really sets a mood in getting you prepared for what you hope is to come. And the next track titled Within which is sung by Gene Simmons was pretty solid as well. But then the album begins to bog down and is filled with too many vain songs boasting of KISS's success.Songs like I Pledge Allegiance to the State of Rock & Roll and You Wanted The Best (Which is a kinda catchy song I'll admit) and Raise Your Glasses just sound like too much cheesy self-centered boasting for my liking thank you. And the Peter Criss ballad I Finally Found My Way while beautifully done just seemed kind of hollow hokey and fake to me. Dreamin' borrows it's opening riff from Alice Cooper's song 18 and it is an okay song but it also gets to be a little boring and repetitive. We Are One by Gene Simmons is a nice heartfelt and touching song.Sadly though the only real solid Rocker on the album is Ace Frehley's Into The Void which is my favorite track on the entire album. It features all the qualities that we have come to know and love in a mighty Space Ace song. The closer Journey of 1000 years sung by Simmons is a yawner.Sigh. This album is a big disappointment. As Gene Simmons says in the Family Guy KISS spoof called KISS Saves Santa 'That does NOT Rock!'. Well he's right it doesn't much. It just does not feel like a true KISS album to me. Which isn't surprising when you read the now well known background on this album which as I have learned featured many studio musicians such as Kevin Valentine Bruce Kulick Tommy Thayer Bob Ezrin and who knows who else? Ah well...Sigh. They can't all be winner's I guess? ",3.0
" I have been a Kiss fan for YEARS. I supported them and defended them for years. Although a little confused over the departure of Ace and Peter in the early 80's (like most kids my age) I gave them a fair shake. When Kiss went public with Lick It Up the first album to feature them without makeup I thought they finally had the chance to write and record material as musicians rather than performers. And I was right year after year album after album they never failed to compose great tracks for an undying metal world. Then...all they hype about a full-blown reunion with Ace and Peter became a reality with the MTV Unplugged release and a reunion tour. So what was next? A new album with Ace and Peter of course. Man us Kiss fans were drooling over the idea...the day had come. I bought Psycho Circus the week it was released. My reaction?...well.....Let's be straight up and honest here. The 'reunion' album SHOULD have BEEN MUCH better. Sure Pcycho Circus has a few great tracks (the title track being the best...) but the majority of it should have been filed away. This album is the result of two egomaniacs assuming that the songs THEY have chosen for the album are the best way to go..and I can see why they feel that way...to a point.Although Ace and Peter are songwriters in their own right they haven't quite written any memorable tunes on their own (save for Ace's EXCELLENT solo record during the Kiss days....) Paul and Gene on the other hand have polished their craft to near perfection over the years. Ace and Peter bailed on them and they kept on truckin'. But the problem here is the majority of the songs are luke warm.Phycho Circus is THE best track on the album and very Kiss with Paul Stanley's trademark vocals at an alltime high.The next track Within is another great one featuring Gene's raspy true blue rock and roll voice complete with backward guitar bursts and a solid deep dark beat.Track three is Pledge...which is also a great number and fits just fine on the album...another example of those great pipes courtesy of Stanley.Into the Void is an Ace Frehley composition that with help from Stanley is the second best track on the album. Interesting enough it was almost 'canned' due to Simmons' lack of interest in the song. But Stanley and Frehley both stood strong and thank God for that...cause as I mentinoned this is a strong superior track to MANY of the others.Next follows We Are One...which is the first one that should have been left off the album. While not necessarily a BAD song it doesn't belong on the album and should have been saved for Simmons' latest solo effort.You Wanted the Best had potential...a LOT of potential if it had a different drum pattern. This track showcases vocals from all four members which gives the track a LOT of character.Raise Your Glasses is another that had potential. The chorus portion of the song has some great chord voicings and the melody of the actual chourus is fantastic....very classic Kiss...but....the verse portions show symptoms of The Elder...an automatic 'scrap' into the trash can...Iv'e Finally Found My Way is a song written by Mr. Stanley and a couple others for Peter Criss to sing. While a decent track for Rod Stewart's latest indulgence it does NOT belong on ANY Kiss album.Dreamin' is another example of a great chorus with a horrible verse melody that causes one to lose interest immediately.1'000 Years is the final offering on the album courtesy of Gene Simmons. This is a perfect close for the album and is very effective in doing so. This one truly belongs.Although it failed to rank as a classic the album sounds excellent. The guitars are rich and carry the album much of the way the drum sounds are wonderful the bass is deep and rich and the vocals are right on top like icing on a cake. But too much polish and 'so-so' songs make Psycho Circus a 'listened to it a few times but that's about it' album. Mr. Fairbain could have been the other reason (God rest his soul...). Listen to Aerosmith's later material Van Halen's Balance and you can see a pattern. This album might have been much better had another producer been utilized. But he was at the top of the game with all the hits he produced with Aerosmith I can't blame Kiss for giving him the torch.Now we have a band that is living on the legacy they created more than 30 years ago; with a different line up and still using the makeup. I feel like many of the fans do. They should either pack it in OR take off the makeup and just make another album... with the latter in mind at least they would represent what they truly are... a great rock and roll band! ",3.0
" I'm a Kiss fan from way back so I really wanted to like this album. Unfortunately there are only a handful of really good songs with the rest of them somewhat below average. For me the standouts include the title track 'We Are One' and 'Raise Your Glasses'. The only song on here that is truly awful is 'I Finally Found My Way' with Peter Criss on vocals. It feels completely out of place with the rest of the music and seems to be another attempt to recreate the song 'Beth'. As much I as love Ace Frehley's bizarre vocals his song 'Into the Void' didn't do anything for me. Overall the main problem with this album is that it doesn't have any direction; the band and songwriters just seem to be going through the motions. It's unfortunate because their two previous studio albums 'Revenge' and 'Carnival of Souls' are both quite good.Like the title says buy it used if you must have it but there are other Kiss albums I would recommend instead of this such as 'Love Gun' 'Dressed to Kill' or the first two live albums.

" Kiss returns to the heavy metal world with a new and raucous album. Psycho Circus's cool album cover and concept gives fans a refreshing and introspective look into the band's triumphant return. The songs sound different from the seventies albums and yet still retain a good rock and roll sensibility.I listened to this album over fifty times and like some of the songs including 'Psycho Circus' 'Into The Void' 'Raise Your Glasses' and 'I Pledge Allegiance To The State Of Rock And Roll.' Still the album might have a better effect when integrated with the band's live show. Nevertheless 'Journey Of A Thousand Years' symbolizes the band's resiliency and longevity. ",3.0

If you really want the best remove the songs I mentioned before and add the first half of 'Carnival of Souls' up to Jungle. That would've been a great disc! Also don't sell merchandise to us on the disc! They have been doing this since 'Alive III'. Enough OK? And still I don't know why but I will be there on the tour! ",3.0
" Just like everyone else I waited for this album once The Originals decieded to write together. This album was a huge disapointment to me. This sounds like something they wanted to do after Unmasked instead of The Elder. It has some rocking songs on it but it lacks rock totally. It is mostly filler with a few killers. This is an ego album all four of them having something to prove to each other once again. You have the main song writers Gene and Paul then you have the one from Ace and of course there is nothing from Peter. I wasn't expecting a Revenge II but I was expecting something a little more out of them. The songs remind me of a step backwards for Gene and Paul. Same solo stuff from Ace. And of course nothing from Peter. I guess he can't write anything so they threw him a bone just to make him stay.'Psycho Circus' keeps you wanting more. KILLER'Within' progession keeps you wanting. KILLER'I Pledge Allegiance...' garage band dreams. FILLER'Into The Void' couldn't you come up with something better than a song about yourself Ace?. FILLER'We Are One' a left over from Gene's first solo album. Or a song that could have been on The Elder. FILLER'You Wanted The Best' could you only bring back painful memories for another reason? FILLER'Raise Your Glasses' this would have been a good song if it wasn't about being a garage band and trying to make it. FILLER'I Finally Found My Way' well Peter found something. Himself singing on an album someone was going to listen to. Is this suppose to be the 'Beth II' song. This is just crap and it's even crapier with his voice. This isn't a FILLER this is ....(I don't think I could put that on here.)'Dreamin' back to the rocking. KILLER'Journey of 1000 Years' this has KILLER written all over it. Just a little problem. This should not have been the last song on the album.After 18 years of being apart this was the best they could have come up with? The cover is cool with it's 3D look. The inside sleave could have been a little better. More photos liner notes. I can actually see why they haven't put out another album after this and just kept touring. Who wants to buy crap. I see this in the USED BIN alot and if I didn't want it so badly when it first came out I would have bought it in a USED BIN also.

I was not happy with the songs that moved from slow to fast they were too many and felt choppy underdeveloped. I have grown to like it and there are a couple of gems - one of them Gloria/Celia's 'tres gotas de agua bendita'. I love Gloria but I feel that in her pursuit to be innovative and appeal to all she sacrificed consistency. I was expecting a more classical style like 'Mi tierra' my all time favorite. For traditional salsa or merengue lovers like me Alma Caribena was a letdown and the last track was a poorly concieved addition. ",3.0

Far the best song of 'Alma Caribena' is 'No me dejes de querer' with an extra great remix by Pablo Flores. I'm looking forward to new remixes that will surely pop up in the near future. Nevertheless Gloria keeps me amazing with her bright voice and her good music that can't stop you from dancing. ",3.0

" Captain Kidd (1945) The always interesting Charles Laughton takes on the title role one he played at least one other time (in Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd). This time though it's a little more serious as the wily pirate captain lies cheats steals and murders his way through a big portion of the supporting cast all in the pursuit of being recognized as a nobleman by English king Henry Daniell. Luckily wronged nobleman's son Randolph Scott has managed to join Kidd's crew and plans to put a stop to the pirate's nefarious doings. Laughton is terrific here playing Kidd as a lower class Britisher whose yearnings to go up in station lead him to all sorts of wicked deeds. He is ably supported by a fine cast including the always welcome Daniell my fave John Carradine and Barbara Britton absolutely luscious as the damsel in distress. Scott may be the only wrong note in the cast as he is a little too old for his part and a little miscast but he provides star power and I'm glad he got to get away from the Westerns for a while. Director Rowland V. Lee (Son of Frankenstein) was obviously working with a relatively low budget and while there is no big sweeping action in this movie with hundreds of pirates swarming over enemy ships there are a couple of good swordfights and the ships are realized through some charming miniature work.

" ALTITUDE is a somewhat fun film. It has many touches of the Mythos. However it is different enough to be modern in perspective. The basic plot centers on a group of young people renting a plane to go to a concert. Their 90 minute flight takes a terrible turn for the worse and supernatural experiences follow. They are caught in a perpetual climb and there is 'something' outside in the storm clouds. (Of course this is impossible because there are no loose bolts on planes. Rivets hold most planes together and all bolts are secured against vibrations.) There are truly bad scenes in the film such as the unlikely but indeed tense sequence of the exterior repair attempt of the plane. In addition the overblown character portrays are simply bad. However the film succeeds in a few small areas. The premise is excellent. The potential of the movie is just astounding. The visuals are good and the idea is sound. It just fails to launch. I want a good Cthulhu movie. This is better than some by far but it still does not measure up to the fullest potential it could. (AM 1200 is the best Cthulhu attempt I have ever seen.) ALTITUDE just falls short. It is fun but it is also weak. The characters look great but they are overdone. They fail to make me care. The 'happy ending' cop out at the end disappoints me and makes me know that the film was not written for the Lovecraft fan. All in all ALTITUDE is a film that average movie goers can skip without regret. However if you are in search of a very minor Cthulhuesque experience it might be worth viewing for the potential it had. ",3.0

" Five young people making a routine flight aboard a small plane end up taking a nightmarish and terrifying journey in Altitude (2010) a suspense thriller with supernatural elements. Nearly the entire movie takes place inside a small twin engine commuter plane during a flight that seems to go on forever. At some point the film passes from the realm of reality leaving the viewer 'up in the air' about what they are watching until it appears that the flight is headed deep into Twilight Zone territory.Largely filmed in the tight quarters of a mock up plane against a green screen Altitude heavily relies on special effects. Once the plane flies into some dark storm clouds the movie assumes a particular CG look that while consistent isn't very realistic. Although the cast appears to have some talent they don't have the greatest material as the writing has set its sights at a very low level. With some major issues with the plot the film's primary merit may lie in its technical achievements.The film opens inside a small plane where a woman is flying with a family aboard. Something happens and the plane suddenly goes down. Flashing forward many years we meet Sara (Jessica Lowndes) the daughter of the pilot who died in the accident. Sara is also a pilot and is taking some friends on a flight to see a Coldplay concert. The passengers are her best friend Mel (Julianne Guill) and her jock boyfriend Sal (Jake Wary) Sara's guitar playing cousin Cory (Ryan Donowho) and Sara's deadhead boyfriend Bruce (Landon Liboiron).The group takes to the air in reasonably high spirits but the mood changes when Sara allows Bruce to fly the plane. After Bruce sends the plane into a dive things deteriorate into childish bickering highlighted by an aggravated Sal picking on Bruce and tearing up his prized comic book. During a climb a loose bolt jams up the tail wing ailerons causing the plane to be locked into a climb where it soon becomes enveloped in black clouds. Bruce eventually panics and Sal uses his wrestling skills to render him unconscious after which Bruce is tied up to keep him from acting up. One of the group exits the plane attached to a rope to try and free the ailerons. Amazingly this crazy stunt works but soon turns into a disaster with Sal claiming that a monster is lurking in the skies.With reality and time seemingly suspended this adventure plays like a reworked episode of the Twilight Zone. The extremely annoying air headed characters are capable of little but arguing and posing stupid questions. The actors aren't totally to blame in this airborne soap opera as the issues are mostly script and production related. Jessica Lowndes is amazingly beautiful but seems completely wrong for the role of Sara. You might expect a pilot to have poise and be capable of calmly dealing with situations but not here. Bruce who has the personality of a corpse doesn't seem a match with Sara. Sal is your stereotypical punk jock with the mental capacity of a 14 year old. Mel seems kind of normal until she proposes the theory that they are in a dream and never actually took off. As the one of the least annoying Cory is of course the first to go.Writer Paul Birkitt's original dark and abrupt ending was revised to be more ambiguous and hopeful. While the resolution is somewhat understandable it's debatable whether those who get a second chance at the expense of those who die are really deserving.Altitude meets the technical challenges fairly well but otherwise is kind of a mess with pretentious characters a monster that looks like it escaped from an episode of Voyage From The Bottom Of The Sea and a silly comic book fantasy element that just isn't that appealing. The implausible flight lasts for far too long and the childish behavior stupid dialog and mentally challenged characters tend to make this a rather frustrating viewing experience for those looking for something more substantial. The film is entertaining but unfortunately mostly for the wrong reasons. It is however perfect material for the Sy Fy Channel. ",3.0
" hooks continues her path down the self-help genre with this latest book about black people and self-esteem. hooks posits that for several decades black people have pointed to racism as their only barrier at the expense of examining personal matters like the loss of self-esteem. In this text she tries to find a middle ground in which racism is acknowledged but low self-esteem is addressed. Unfortunately assessing racism takes up so much of the text that many readers may completely forget the message about self-esteem. Further while hooks affectively points to where black self-esteem is lacking she says very little about how it can be regained.In so many ways hooks is beating a dying horse. Her book Salvation could have been attached to her book All about Love and Rock My Sould could have been attached to Salvation. Whereas in her love books she clearly spells out the definition of love and emphasizes love in every chapter here self-esteem gets lost in the mix and is given charecteristics but never concretely defined.hooks loves patting herself on the back for being able to talk about race class and gender simultaneously. In this book her love of male heroes Malcolm X and Dr. King shines through. Though consistently pro-black in this book hooks actually praises whites for their resistance to sexism and rigid gender roles and condemns blacks for embracing those two oppressions. Still hooks uses kid gloves when critiquing McWhorter and other black conservatives in contrast to her complete trashing of Wolf Roiphe and Paglia in her book Outlaw Culture.hooks is great at summarizing black history. She re-illustrates how thoroughly and widely she reads.Nevertheless she quotes Nathaniel Branden so often one wonders if she has just taken his book(s) and given it (them) a chocolate-y twist. If you've read her other books so much of this book is repetitive. We already know she has conflicting feelings about rapper Foxxxy Brown and detests Sharazad Ali and 'Waiting to Exhale.' hook often mentions 'terrorism' in this 911 era but her use may seem pat and overblown to some readers. hooks has added 'imperialism' to her mantra of 'white supremacist capitalist patriarchy'; this only begs the question more of why she can't use 'heteropatriarchy' or explicitly state how homophobia is just as rampant in this society as other oppressions. Further hooks has always declared that she adds bibliographies to her books to avoid user-unfriendly footnotes yet this book cites many books and has no bibliography.I'll still read anything that bell publishes it's just that this book was not that great.

" I read this book and thought hooks touched on an untapped subject within the black community which is our collective lost of healthy self-esteem. I do agree that blacks of all socioeconomic backgrounds in this country have been choking spiritually on the dominant white culture values. White culture values have now transcended race; it doesn't matter who is in collusion it could be a white person but lately it has been people of color who has perpetuated this poisoning mindset amongst our own.What I disliked about the book is the self-righteous stance hooks tends to do in her writing as of late. She writes about in great length about the evils blacks have done to contribute to the white color caste society-light skin blacks privilege over darker skin blacks. While I wholeheartedly agree with her it's funny how she never shares her privileges on being light-skinned herself. She never talks about the personal instances where she has gotten privilege over someone darker. She only goes on about light-skinned people in general. I think her message would have been more powerful if she also shares with the reader how she has been put in that privilege position even if she rejected it and critiqued it. She only talks about the ills that have been done to her but never the privileges. ",3.0

" This is a haunting tale of Gracie's survival the night the Titanic sunk. It is quite a read however it is certainly written in the 'tongue' of the early 20th century. It is interesting to hear the point of view of someone who went through so much the night the Titanic sunk and to see what was happening around him. It does have its flaws though and while it must be remembered that was the way of the times it is still a bit much to stomach at times. Gracie was a first class passenger therefore he spoke almost exclusively of those in first class. When he spoke of anyone from steerage it was very clear he thought of them almost as another species. He was quite degrading of them the way they dressed and the way they spoke. Of course we knew many first class passengers on that boat or on any boat would feel the third class passengers were not worth their time and would feel as though they were much better than anyone in the classes below them it was still a little infuriating to read that arrogance. Nevertheless it's a good book to read to get a truthful look at that night. ",3.0
" A lot more than the numerous films went into. There were those that were selfless and braveor resigned to their deaths. And those that were not. Capt Smith went down with his ship  be it jumping into the water or other. The arrogance to call it unsinkable. We learn about living from how these people handled this ships maiden voyage. ",3.0
" Well when you are researching a bunch of bicycle accessories and you see 'QR' in the title you can pretty much assume that stands for Quick Release. Except for this one. It does NOT have a Quick Release clamp it has a 4 bolt allen wrench clamp. you can see this if you look closely at the photo but I guess I missed it after comparing so many racks some of which have Quick Release clamps.I'm sending mine back because I really wanted that feature so I can move it to different bikes easily. This rack looks OK and well built but it stands out as being rated for only 15 lbs as compared to 20 for most of this type and it seems a bit short (I ordered the V model). ",3.0
" Why is it that none of the previous reviewers have mentioned that no matter how good or bad this CD is the Johnny Yuma song that Cash sings is not the Johnny Yuma we know. It's a totally different song. Very misleading and very dishomest of the producers of this CD to include that when we werer all expecting the well-known Yuma song. ",3.0
" Wow no review for Architect of Fear? After splitting with Atlantic in 1987 and leaving us with the last great classic Raven album Life's a Bitch Raven did one album with Combat Nothing Exceeds Like Excess. Well that album was kinda low budget and very over the top. There new drummer Joe Hasselvander out-wackoed Wacko. Well that contract lasted one album and by then thrash was pretty much over. What's a band gonna do? They packed up there bags and went to Germany where they were still popular. There they recorded Architect of Fear '91 and very quickly the Head's Up ep '91. Both these albums are very similar in feeling and content. They kinda toned it back down to an All for One style of songwriting. Now these songs aren't as good as that album but they are very good. The production is excellent also. If you're a fan of the old Raven I don't think you'll be sorry if you seek these out. Oh I'm not sure if the Japan import has an extra track over the German one. The German one is 13 tracks. ",3.0
" I'm a coffee snob! When I first purchased my Keurig coffee maker I was excited to make my morning cup of coffee so quickly and easily. Unfortunately what I sacrificed was taste. I've since sampled over a dozen different types of k-cup coffees made for my machine and have yet to find one that makes a truly delicious cup of coffee. I will continue to try all of the recommended brands hoping to find that 'ahhhhh' flavor. In the meantime I use the little filter adaptor that allows me to use my own ground beans in the machine. The Kenya Kilimadjaro k-cup is probably one of the better coffees I've tried so far but the snob in me still only rates it a 3-star taste compared to what I would consider a great cup of coffee.

" I was so impressed with Raymond Briggs' Ethel & Ernest from last month that I decided to read his other graphic novel When the Wind Blows which is also in the 500 Essential Graphic Novels. Unlike his other graphic novel When the Wind Blows is not as uplifting or heartfelt. Instead Briggs tells the story of a happily married couple and how they are effected by nuclear war. The couple survived the Blitz in London during WWII and therefore have very interesting reactions to the Cold War. While the husband is extremely trusting of the government and creates a plan in case nuclear war occurs his wife is less trusting and believes that no such atrocity will occur. When a nuclear warhead is dropped on England the couple must try their best to survive.Being that the graphic novel was written in 1982 it seems a bit dated to the contemporary reader. Still it is incredibly interesting to read a graphic novel that was written during the Cold War about the Cold War. All of the anxieties and fear feel extremely raw and despite it being almost twenty years later those feelings still affect the reader. While the subject matter is extremely depressing Briggs does give his characters a sense of humor that creates a bit of comic relief but the impending doom is still hanging over the tale. As is true with Snowman and Ethel & Ernest the graphics are gorgeous and look almost like watercolors. Overall I think that this is an excellent read and in many ways better than Ethel & Ernest.

" I picked up Mermaid Park because it claims to be set at the Jersey shore. It tells of 16-year-old Amy trying to survive a family that consists of an immature petty and verbally abusive stepfather a younger sister who is learning to emulate him and a mother who seems oddly detached as if she is drifting along in an air-headed haze not noticing her family disintegrating around her. Amy's father lives in another city too involved in his hobbies to connect with his daughters.A weekend trip to the Jersey shore motel of an old family friend ends in a fight and the insistance that Amy stay behind as her mother & stepfather place all blame for the family's troubles on her. Amy moves into the motel apartment with owner Lynne with the understanding that she will stay out of trouble and get a job. She finds work at the Mermaid Park of the title an old-fashioned amusement where girls in sequinned tails perform in a huge water tank. Eventually her job leads to the uncovering of old family secrets and lies.It's a decent book for the most part capturing the anger & frustration of a girl being unfairly blamed as the troublemaker in an already troubled family touching on the loss she feels at being distanced from her sister and father and at losing the former closeness shared with her divorced mother when she re-marries a cruel man.Scattered inconsistancies jump out at a reader deeply familiar with the Wildwood NJ setting however",3.0
" This book-on-tape which seems to take place sometime during the next generation movies finds Worf in command of a small Klingon fleet resettling the colonists in wake of the Genesis wave. In this process they encounter a culture that has decided to preserve themselves in their orbital transporter network.Tim Russ (Voyager's Tuvok) does an excellent job of portraying the full gauntlet of characters ranging from the out-of-favor scientist turned savior to the planet's genetically-perfect ruler to Worf and the Klingons.The story brings back a few now-older characters like Worf's son Alexander and Jeremy (the kid that Worf took under his wing because he lead the away team that resulted in his mother's death). Both have ended up serving under Worf on the Klingon ship (Jeremy apparently through some sort of Federation exchange program). Unfortunately the rest of the enterprise crew play a very minor role in the whole saga.The story begins to pick up when the now-destroyed and supposedly lifeless planet appears to have life on it; moreover this life form seems to be able to shape-shift and nearly convinces the colonists to begin coming down in droves before the Klingons discover that the life forms are not what they appear.The Klingons want to put everything on hold until they can figure out the mystery of the planet. In the interim however another mystery (which becomes Alexander's challenge) is formed when the planet's leader is killed and the heir-apparent and scientist-savior are the two leading suspects.The colonists are not willing to wait (with the transporter systems failing and afraid of loosing lives) and begin a process that is supposed to re-terraform the planet. However what they don't know apparently can hurt them and does. ",3.0
" I am a big fan of the Scene It games. As an avid Disney fan I was truly excited to receive this for Christmas. While it is a fun game please note that most of the questions are difficult only if you are a child. Even then they are VERY EASY. My friend's three year old daughter was easily able to answer most of the questions. Therefore if you are looking for a game that is challenging (i.e. Scene It TV edition's bizarre questions) you won't really find it here. Some of Disney's more obscure movies garner questions in this game but most are geared to the animated movies of the past decade. All in all a perfect game for FAMILIES but if you are twenty to thirty-somethings looking for a challenging game this is NOT for you. ",3.0
