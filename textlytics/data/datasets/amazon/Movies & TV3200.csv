" Disc One (73",5.0
" Yes indeed the game was beautiful. Too bad no one really knows about it. When i played the game I absolutely loved it. A true masterpiece one of squaresofts best by far. But when I got the Soundtrack it was mind blowing. Every Song was on it. Plus the caftsmanship from the director was just overwhelming. The game and soundtrack by far are the best in squaresofts history. Never has there been a great combination. From Listening threw out Disc one which features some really cool Resident Evil only in symphony mode. Yes this Soundtrack is by far the best Video Game soundtrack that I have ever gotten. All I have to say is get the game first once you beat it. Get the soundtrack next. You'll know what I mean by what a true RPG game and music is all about. ",5.0
" With Vagrant Story Sakimoto expertly combines dissonance ambience and melody to create a simply gorgeous videogame score. In fact I'm going to call it one of Squaresoft's best. There is not one dud in the soundtrack. It's even better in-game but buy the soundtrack! ",5.0
" The only critiscm I have about this sound track are the two bonus tracks (which don't appear in the game and add nothing to the preceding tracks on the cds) and the strange morph that one of the tracks (I believe that it is Escape) takes turning from a good piece of music into something that seems to have escaped from the eighties.Apart from that I can't recommend this OST highly enough especially Disc 2 - Track 29 -Staff Roll which unlike the other tracks on the disc is an acoustic Strings Piece that really shows off Hitoshi Sakimoto's talents as a composer. ",5.0
" When I heard the first few tracks of this OST in an ill-fated battle track contest I can't say I was too impressed. They seemed to be rather bland and even downright boring. However I used to also think the same thing about the Final Fantasy Tactics soundtrack which I now adore. That and I'm not the type to give up on an entire soundtrack after listening to just a few songs once or twice.That said I took it upon myself to find the Vagrant Story soundtrack and I forced myself to listen to it. Several times. Dozens of times even. I played it on the PC. In the car and my portable players. Eventually it began to grow on me. I began to appericiate its incredibly dark ambience its undeniable intelligence the wonderful quality of the synth and the sheer complexity of the compositions a delight for people like me who like to analyze things.I think I first realized 'I love this soundtrack' when I felt shivers running down my spine while listening to the end of 'Climax of the Grayland Case.' How beautiful! Or maybe it was when it thought to myself 'That heavy piano playing really does remind me of iron!' while listening to 'Iron Crab'. Or perhaps it was when I was listening to 'Staff Roll' and it made my day a little happier when the main melody kicked in at around 4",5.0
" Excellent stockings for long shifts on your feet - not too tight not too loose...garment integrity is longer than package states (with proper care). ",5.0
" After I had a DVT my doctor required me to wear compression stockings. I wore ugly white TED hose and yucky thick brown stockings. Then I found Jobst UltraSheer. They gave me the compression I needed (15-20) but looked like regular pantyhose. Even though my blood clot has been gone for 4 years I still buy these to wear as support stockings because they make my legs feel so nice.**Note I have problems with the rubberized tops rolling down my thigh. I tried the Jobst adhesive but I hated having my skin pulled all day. I bought an inexpensive garter belt and it works fine and helps keep the stockings from rolling. ",5.0
" My doctor recommended the thigh high version of this product but I became very aggravated with them constantly rolling down through the course of the day. They were never comfortable. With my doctor's permission I switched over to the knee highs and they are WONDERFUL!!! I don't even know I'm wearing them! They totally control my calf aching and swelling. Would highly recommend them!!! ",5.0
" Stockings fit well and are comfortable. Haven't had the opportunity to see how effective they are in preventing edema from air travel. ",5.0
" Excellent product. However they are very difficult to get on for older people. I feel like I've had a full day workout after getting them on. Also as the day wears on they begin to roll down from the top and create a very deep ridge in the skin. I have to wear them so if those two difficulties could be addressed it would be such a help. ",5.0
" Does a very good job of relieving fatigue. This is a well known brand and is certainly comfortable enough to wear all day. Even if your doctor didn't prescribe these but you are on your feet alot take care of yourself and buy these. ",5.0
" It is wonderful to find exactly what you are looking for. I didn't after three years using them I found they have them with a closed toes. I love them ",5.0
" I've always had pain in my legs during long travels either by car or plane when you can't move very much. I used them for a recent trip consisting on 6 flights total and I could feel the difference. I wasn't totally stiff when I got off the planes. They do stay in place with the band at the top. Just be careful they tear as easily as stockings. If you'll use them much you better get a couple of extra pairs. ",5.0

" I thoroughly enjoyed Rising Sons and Daughters. I don't know of any other book that looks at Japanese society from the point of view of its young people poised as they are between their parents' age-old Japanese culture of restraint and obedience to the will of the community and their peers' adulation of Western culture. True to form the 'New Young' of Japan seem to be creating an 'international' blend as the Ando family demonstrates in this beautifully written book of vignettes of the private lives of members of this family. Steven Wardell is clearly a talented young author adopted for some of his schooling into this family of four teens and thus able to view family life in Japan from the inside out. A great read! ",5.0
" Wondering what the hell has happened to the moral aspect of modern American culture ? This book is a lucid well argued explanation of the simple fact that we have become so totally focused on our individual RIGHTS that we have completely ignored and even mocked our personal and public responsibilities. The final response and indictment of Robert Ringer's best seller LOOKING OUT FOR #1. This is a great time for anyone who is disgusted with the boorish state of American media politics and discourse in general to clear their heads for the substantial challenges that lie before us not only as Americans but as human beings. A great book ",5.0
" Joy in God--necessary? Or simply optional??? John Piper explains why that if Christ is to be the sun at the center of the solar system of our lives then He must also be our supreme joy over all other 'lesser treasures.' Glorifying God can only be done from a heart that is glad in God. Deep joy in God is the true foundation for all obedience; treasuring Him over all things is the only Christ-exalting motivation to endure suffering...especially to willfuly choose suffering.Show it to your Youth Group Men's/Women's Group or Home Bible Study. Set your church ablaze with a passion for the glory of God in the supremacy of Christ over all things in this world. Everything being fueled by a Spirit produced joy and satisfaction in the Lord Himself--to His praise and renoun!Only because of grace--Jeffrey ",5.0
" Piper has a passion for the glory of Christ that is contagious. I've watched these videos multiple times and glean something from it every time. Amazing that he presents this MEATY material to a youth group and they are transfixed the entire time.I don't really care for the youth interviews but I understand given the format of the original presentation. I've used this in a men's group and all enjoyed the material and we had some great discussions.I'd recommend to anybody. The humility and genuine concern of Piper toward his audience is refreshing against some of the other more famous 'christian leaders' today. ",5.0
" I am so grateful for the Blazing Center DVD and the exceptional price. I enjoyed immensely seeing the dynamic presentation by an author I have read for all these years. I would love to see this DVD given to many of our grandchildren. ",5.0

" Though it would be nice to have a solid polished brass fireplace screen this product certainly fits our needs. For the price it looks quite attractive and provides what we wanted in safety. It sets off our polished brass in our living room and serves the purpose to protect against accidents for our granddaughters. Quick service on delivery as well. ",5.0
" We were surprised. Pleasantly.A weighty perfect model of this classic screen would certainly not be available for anything close to the price of the Uniflame model but the Uniflame looks amazingly good anyway. This thing does the trick!We bought it to replace an 'original' solid brass model costing nearly $500 (and it's cheap construction design eventually giving way to its heaviness when moved). As long as someone doesn't examine the new screen from close-up it actually looks better (not really terrible at all close-up) and it's lighter weight makes it easy to handle.JRT ",5.0
" This is an excellent fireplace screen for the price. I was somewhat surprised at how light the screen is as compared to other fireplace screens I have in the house. You certainly won't have a hard time moving it away from the fireplace. I actually purchased it to put in front of a gas fireplace in order to make the fire look more authentic and it does the job ! ",5.0
" Product arrived on the third day after I ordered despite a delivery estimate of 7-10 days. I'm impressed with both the product and the marketplace seller (PrimeNetShops). The screen came well packaged and in good shape. One of the decorative knobs on top had come unscrewed and was in the bottom of the box but it re-attached with ease. It's light enough that it can be moved with ease but still feels sturdy enough that it should last for years to come. Great product great experience. Everything that is right about Amazon all in one order! ",5.0
" Man some more jammin tracks from the SUC. This is Pokey's first official record....and sh** is sooo real. Love the production everything is real nice & screwed out. This is among the last of the great SUC records. Not to say they've fallen off....just they've downsized so much with the deaths of the screw pioneers. Sad but true. If ya love Tx rap you've gotta get this 1. Somethin to kickback & blow big too somethin to jam in the ride. So underrated right here. I wish people would forget all the bullsh** on BET/MTV and check what's happening in Houston. But i guess...it's sadly almost too late. Pat's gone hawk's gone...screw Moe Pimp C Big Steve. Makes me sad. Regardless Pokey is still alive and making new music keeping the legacy alive. And this is a great place to start with him. Classic record. Love it man ",5.0

Thank you Bear Family! ",5.0
" This book contains a great amount of vocabulary. It teaches you the Anglicized versions of certain words such as 'teacher' but it also gives you the Yoruba word. Although I didn't appreciate the Anglicized words at first they are good to know because a lot of people use them. The CD is an excellent and necessary addition to the book. There are lots of dialogues and lists of vocabulary on them (there are 2 CDs). The CD does skip over some of the exercises in the book which I guess you're supposed to go over by yourself or with a teacher though. All in all it's a great set and if mastered can bring the user to a high level of fluency. I also like that the narrator who speaks English to announce the lessons is a native speaker and doesn't butcher the names of the characters in the dialogues. There is a Yoruba book/CD set created by another publisher who uses a British narrator. It really throws you off course throughout the CD. Watch out for that one and buy this one instead! ",5.0

" My 4 year old daughter LOVES this game. She sings the 'Strike Up The Band and Clap Your Hands for Kelly's Pet Parade!' song around the house. She can dress the Kelly kids 'train' each pet (teach the pony to jump etc.) clean and get the animals ready for the parade (paint the elephant's toe nails etc.) and decorate the floats...all by herself. She'll get everything ready (showing me everything she has accomplished along the way) and then we'll watch her special parade. A wonderfully cute game that I highly recommend.She can mostly do the entire game on her own. I have it installed on a laptop so she is actually using the inset mouse and can still do the game. The only one she has a tough time with is the Polar Bear catching fish game. It's tricky to move your finger on the mouse pad and click at the same time to catch the fish. It would be much easier using a regular mouse. ",5.0

" My 6-year old and 5-year old both really enjoy this game. Has lots to do with several different animals to prepare for the parade. You get to design a float and it just endless fun! Graphics and animation are very colorful and cute. It's a winner! ",5.0
" Apparently this is about the best $... I have spent lately (aside from the Gameboy game I sent my nephew). My niece is mesmorized by this game and it is keeping my sister busy building parades. My niece is a little too young to run this program by herself but she has definitely figured out what button needs to be pushed to make the parade start! My sister also told me that she likes the fact that you can save multiple parades for those days when she just doesn't have time to help create a new one. This seems to be a winner! ",5.0
" I got this for my 3 1/2 yr old for Christmas and both her and her 7 yr old sister LOVE it! They have played it for hours. The graphics are very good and it has lots of cute and entertaining games! I highly recommend this one! It's worth the money! ",5.0

" If you've played this game in the arcade and liked it then you'll definitely like this version to play at home whenever you like. You don't need a supercomputer to run it and the graphics and controls are amazing and faithful to the incredibly fun and fast arcade experience. This version also has plenty of unlockables which you get by playing and earning miles as well as mini-games that are a fun diversion from the classic arcade game. It has the European-themed levels of Outrun2 and the America-themed levels of Outrun2 SP for a total of 30 stages to race through in the classic Outrun-branching style or sequentially or with challenges such as beating rival racers. This game is affordable fun and has plenty of replay value. You may not want to play it for hours and hours but you'll keep coming back to it if you like to get a speedy arcade fix every now and then. ",5.0
" I remember playing Outrun in the arcades when it came out in the I think it was eighties. It had flashy graphics flashy steering wheel pedals and corny but catchy music. It was the kind of game I'd play on the way out of the arcade when all but the last dribbles of coinage had been spent on the more 'serious' (read challenging) games. Actually when I think about it Outrun was always placed by the entrance perhaps for this reason. Main meal of games inside followed by quick dessert on the way out. And Outrun is quick. And fun. And flashy. Colourful pretty and simple. Not much depth here but some very cool twists on your standard arcade racer. Lots of different Ferraris lots of different scenery and wow does it look good! Pure unadulterated eye candy. Two problems however. It wont run on full accelerated sound on my sound card (budget Creative) so I have to switch the acceleration back to minimum through my control panel or the game will just keep crashing when it comes time to race. Secondly the configuration for gamepad bites. It won't allow me to allocate the buttons I want for acceleration and braking so I end up using the right analogue joystick for both (left to accelerate right to brake). Sounds dicky and I suppose it is but it's actually pretty easy to get used to. As far as I'm aware there are no patches for said problems. Despite these issues Outrun 2006 C2C is a blast fun from go to wo. It's sugary sweet and just the thing for a low gaming BSL. ",5.0

" Thanks to my grandparents who came to America in the first decade of the 20th century I grew up and have had a good life. Thanks to my grandparents I didn't become a piece of ash or a few tossed out bones in an Eastern European field at the age of 2. Wars are wars; they've occured throughout human history but in most of them whole civilizations didn't disappear. But the Eastern European Jewish world is gone forever. I might belong to the same gene pool but compared to the characters in Isaac Bashevis Singer's stories I'm as American as apple pie. Irish-Americans can discover their roots in Ireland Chinese-Americans in China and so on but not me. My cultural roots are gone forever. The only way I can learn them is through reading literature written by Singer Shalom Aleichem Isaac Babel and others who describe that vanished world. So obviously my interest and pleasure in reading such wonderful tales as appear in THE SEANCE and OTHER STORIES is all the more. Never mind my personal reasons. These amazing stories by a Nobel Prize winner will stay with you for a long time. The strange sad characters afflicted by poverty and by life bring us face to face with common human personalities of all times and places while also depicting the conditions and peculiar relationships of Jews in Poland too. Magic religion animals thieves rabbis prostitutes mystics Holocaust survivors Talmudic scholars prisoners books butchers and shopkeepers crowd the pages. In each story you find pathos and tragedy happiness and satisfaction tensions and transformations. Two of the stories 'The Seance' and 'The Letter Writer' must rank with the best stories I have ever read; none of the others are bad. If you have never read Singer this is an excellent book to start with. If you have you know what I am talking about. This is the great writer at the top of his form. ",5.0
" Isaac Bashevis Singer was no doubt one of the greatest short story writers - ever! The various collections in the end also earned him a very well deserved Nobel Prize for literature in 1978. Several of his stories were first published in magazines like The New Yorker Encounter and Playboy. The first collection I read was Passions and Other Stories which immediately made me realise what a master Isaac Bashevis Singer was. Later I have read several of his novels and short stories where especially the collections Gimpel the Fool Short Friday and The Seance are at least as good as Passions. All a magnificent world of Isaac Bashevis Singer's saints and sinners. Sad funny ironic poignant and seeming to come from Singer's pen without any efforts. This is what good short stories is all about! ",5.0

" Of many CDs I've purchased in the last couple of years this easily ranks as one of the best. Kudos to Muse for finally recording Spaulding as a leader in 1988 and now to Joel Dorn for reissuing the disk.As the title indicates 'Brilliant Corners' is filled with music by Monk. But what stands out is the freshness of the interpretations of the master's pieces. Rather than simply trying to sound like Monk Spaulding and his cohorts try -- very successfully -- to make music that builds on Monk's ideas.Spaulding tears through every solo he has on alto and offers beautiful contrast with his flute playing as on 'Let's Cool One.' He's aided by trumpeter Wallace Roney who abandons his occasional propensity for imitating Miles Davis and instead lets his own sound shine through. Pianist Mulgrew Miller has never sounded better. In fact the whole group (Ron Carter on bass and Kenny Washington on drums) strongly delivers the message that they are playing music that they love. There is no better way to express that love than by offering the robust voicings that you hear on this disk.If there is a regret when you listen to this music it is that Spaulding who contributed so much to Blue Note dates in the '60s has had so few opportunities to further explore his own muse. Better late than never. ",5.0
" Story goes that after a number of excellent second horn sessions on mid 60's Blue Note where flute.altoand soprano were wielded masterfully by James Spaulding he was given a shot as a leader.He was the non star(leader) that was called in manymany times.But at the point he got his offer Direction/Production had switched from Alfred Lion to Francis Wolff and A&R; fro Ike Quebec to Duke Pearson.Bottom line was they offered Spaulding a shot if he would fit into the new funky blues idiom of the Liberty era and he refused not being true to the hard bop form.Well even though he recorded few albums as a leader latter on labels like Muse('Smile Of The Snake' and 'Blues Nexus are also fine 4 star or better efforts).He he has and excellent session with Wallace Ronney on trumpetMulgrew Miller and Ron Carter on bass and Kenny Washington on drums.Fine line up.And though there are so many Monk tribute Lp's it is the musicianship wielded with passion that makes this a cut of above.As mentioned his flute playing is fine.I find jazz flute hit or miss and here it just works fine.Not a direct copy of the Monk style it shows th timeless of the compositions (not that a total analogue LP with some personal character is bad-see Walter Davis Jr. piano solo 'In Walked Thelonius').I'd call this no an essential Lp but for Monk fans it may be.CheersChazz ",5.0
" Few pieces of music in the history of the gramophone can have suffered such indignities at the hands of insensitive record producers as Saint-Sans's Third Symphony. A glance through the catalogues might suggest one is spoiled for choice but to date I have only found two recordings which do full justice to the work. Now here's a third although altogether different. . . this is a recording which not only deserves repeated listening but positively demands it. Yu reveals just what a magnificent piece of music this is; shorn of its customary sonic spectacle the brilliant craftsmanship of Saint-Sans's writing is displayed in unimpeded glory. . .In The Carnival of the animals . . . Yu opts for the version for large orchestra complete with glass harmonica (adeptly played by Alasdair Malloy) and while it is again characterized by meticulous attention to detail it is also a performance full of buoyant wit. . .

Five years later she still takes many supplementary courses each year to continue her education. Most of her free time is spend with distance learning courses or reaching herbs. Chinese Medicine is vast and deep. A 5 year basic study is not nearly enough time to understand this medicine. In Chinese Medicine they say even a lifetime is not long enough to understand this medicine. Thankfully for the lay person we have this book!I personally own 2 copies of this book. One I have at home the other is in our Chinese Medicine office.

" The Gathering to me has always been an escape from the everyday music you hear. So when I heard they were releasing a B-sides and rarities collection I was more than happy. Every expectation I had they met. I'm dumbfounded as to how The Gathering can create such innovative and beautiful music yet they're still somehow overlooked. From the epic orchestrations to Anneke's jawdropping voice there's no reason that everyone shouldn't love this music. Needless to say if you liked The Gathering before you got this CD if anything you'll like them more coming out of listening to it.Disc one acts as the B-sides. A lot of B-sides have horrible sound quality but the ones on this compilation sound as if they were on a CD but were taken off at the extreme last minute. There's a polished feel but not so polished that the music feels fabricated. The live versions featured on here are astounding. If you didn't look at the back cover to know they were live you'd never guess it. Anneke's voice is gorgeous and the band is just simply amazing. How they don't miss a single beat I'll never know. The covers Dead Can Dance's In Power We Entrust The Love Advocated Slowdive's When The Sun Hits and Talk Talk's Life's What You Make It are about the best covers I've ever heard. Quite often you hear a band just desecrate the original but with The Gathering it feels like they took they're time while doing the originals justice.Disc two serves as the rarities section. From the opening track New Moon Different Day you know that The Gathering is eons better than almost any band playing music today. Anneke's vocals simply soar and will give you goosebumps that I will guarantee. It doesn't end there though each song is equally as good as the last. Even the demos have a sound quality that could rival a studio CD. The two previously unreleased instrumentals Diamond Box and Hjelmar's stand true to the ones that are released. The beauty is palpable and shows tremendous skill skill that no radio band will ever come close to. Travel from the CD How To Measure A Planet? has always been my favorite song by The Gathering. To hear the demo is really something though it sounds completely different while still sounding exactly the same. My second favorite track of their's Nighttime Birds is the same case as Travel. I do think Anneke's vocals are stronger on Nighttime Birds though.Overall my favorite songs are In Power We Entrust The Love Advocated Frail Life's What You Make It New Moon Different Day Nighttime Birds and Travel. The Gathering is a band I've always found to be one that you have to experience rather than listen to. Yes you can pick favorite songs but overall each CD they released and even this collection seem to be made to go together. Each song seems to flow into the next seamlessly. In my opinion no band does this genre more justice than The Gathering does. ",5.0
" All fans of The Gathering need to check this out especially those in the States where the majority of these songs are nearly impossible to find anywhere else. This compilation is worth buying for 'In Power We Entrust the Love Advocated' (Dead Can Dance cover) and 'When the Sun Hits' (Slowdive cover) alone; both are heartbreakingly beautiful and feature some of Anneke's finest vocals.Fans of The Gathering's albums Mandylion and Nighttime Birds will be delighted with 'Adrenaline' a very catchy song that was written because the band needed another fast simple rocking song to play at concerts.I think The Gathering's greatest album is How to Measure a Planet and it is awesome to finally hear the demos for songs like 'Travel' 'My Electricity' and 'Red is a Slow Colour.' 'Travel' especially went through a lot of transformations before its final version.This double-CD has so much to offer. There are also detailed song descriptions written by the band and several photos on the inside booklet. ",5.0
" If I could only have one selection by The Gathering this would be it. Some of the alternate versions are better than what was originally released (e.g. instrumental version of Kevin's Telescope).

" Four DVDs in the 'Thomas & Friends' series are sure to delight young viewers ages 2 and up with the exciting adventures of Thomas the Tank Engine and his transportational friends. Each affordably priced DVD features narration by celebrity George Carlin roughly 40 minutes of short stories plus another 60 minutes of bonus features such as sing-along songs DVD games and character galleries. 'A Big Day for Thomas' covers Thomas' adventure when he gets to pull his very own train for the first time; 'Trust Thomas & Other Stories' follows Thomas' discovery of a new way to cross a river; 'Percy's Ghostly Trick & Other Thomas Stories' is a spooky adventure in which Percy's mischievous trick to make Thomas believe in ghosts backfires when Percy puffs into a big pile of hay. 'Thomas & The Special Letter' sets up a conflict with George a bad-tempered steamroller convinced that roads are more important than rails. Since the many stories on each DVD are so short they can be shown to young people who have only a few spare minutes such as right before bedtime or all at once.

" First of all let me say that I love Thomas the Tank Engine. My 6-year-old son has loved Thomas for 3+ years running and I am very grateful for all the good times the three of us have had. That having been said this is a compilation VHS. You will not find any new stories on this one. However it is worth viewing (and getting if you don't have a big collection) if you have children. We got this as a gift from friends so having duplicates of the stories was not a big problem with us. Interspersed between the stories is what seems to be an advertisement for the 'Day Out With Thomas.' It is interesting to watch but is not informative for one actually thinking about participating in one of the programs.ABOUT THE STORIES",5.0
" My son has several of the Thomas DVDs and while he's just as content to watch any of them this is his favorite. The episodes with Bertie and Terrance are great. Overall a wonderful collection of earlier Thomas narrated by George Carlin. The interviews with kids are cute and provide more than just the usual shots of various engines. I find this DVD better than the 'Best of' engines ones because of the variety. Plus my son has no clear favorite and enjoys watching them all. ",5.0

" Anyone who wants to understand the movies of the Soviet Union should start with this book. It is very thorough and written in a lively bright style that is free of academic jargon.Kenez begins with the pre-Revolutionary film industry and shows how it broke down and was built back up by the Soviets. He pays equal attention to the 'high art' films that were famous in the West for decades (those of Eisenstein and Pudovkin) and the entertainment films that attracted the average Soviet citizen (such as the musical comedies of the 1930s like 'Volga-Volga.') He shows how Soviet movies responded to the imposition of Socialist Realism World War II and the cultural freeze of the late Stalin era.The only problem with this book is that it is TOO SHORT. Upon reaching the end the reader wants to see Kenez tackle the films of the Khrushchev Thaw and the Brezhnev era. However one should be thankful for what one has and in this volume one has a truly indispensible book. ",5.0

" This book was awesome. A fast paced riveting novel by an author I am coming to find just CANNOT disappoint me. I am hooked on her Carpathians and now find that I will run just as fast to the bookstore when her next gothic comes out.THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a terrific love story and mystery set in a supposedly cursed castle that has everything from grinning gargoyles to an impressive maze. The hero and heroine are just as riveting in their fascinatin for each other and then their entanglement in the mystery of THE SCARLETTI CURSE. I highly recommend this book to all readers Feehan fan or not. But be warned by the time you turn the last page of this book you will be hooked on Christine Feehan. ",5.0

You can use any search engine to get to it. But this book really is wonderful! It can really stand on it's own! I can't wait for more from this author. The publishing company needs to publish her stuff quicker than this! Can't wait till Darius's story Dark Fire! Feel free for anyone to e-mail with any questions! I'll sell you on these books! ",5.0
" The heroine Nicoletta is the village healer. Overlord Don Giovanni exercises his right to select a village girl as his bride and chooses Nicoletta against her wishes. His home the Palazzio is a foreboding place mysterious and frightening to the villagers...a place with a history of death. Giovanni is able to communicate with Nicoletta mind to mind...the only similarity to the Dark Series Heroes...bringing a subtle sensuality to their burgeoning relationship...a welcome change from the 'pounce on each other in the first chapter' genre. Feehan continues to bring us dark heroes and independant heroines who find love in the sharing of each others gifts. ",5.0

I started to read it and in the first chapter it grabbed me and I couldn't put it down. I read it in one day (of course I got no work done) but it was well worth it.

" I became a fan of Christine's writing through her 'Dark' series and although this ventured into different territory I was not disappointed. Christine's style and gift for writing wonderful heroes and heroines along with a fascinating story is not lost. Nicoletta is a strong compassionate courageous heroine that learns to make the best of a frightening and seemingly hopeless situation. She is forced into marriage with the mysterious Giovanni Scarletti who's reputation of darkness and danger strikes fear in the hearts of most in her village. To make matters worse once married she will be forced to live in the cursed Scarletti palazzo secretly nicknamed the 'Palazzo Della Morte' where few women who enter manage to escape with their lives. Despite her hesitation she soon discovers there is a powerful attraction between she and Giovanni and seeks to unravel the mystery surrounding her own mother's death in the castle years ago. Is Giovanni the monster her fellow villagers whispered he was or could there be much more to him than she first imagined? Giovanni is just the type of hero I enjoy like the heroine he is one that can both frighten me yet manage to touch my heart at the same time. The story kept me on the edge of my seat. For fans of the paranormal there is that aspect as well. Nicoletta is gifted with a healing power and Giovanni has the power to speak directly into your mind. Kudos to Christine for the many hours of enjoyment her novels provide! ",5.0
" Ms. Feehan has written another entertaining and engrossing book. I got very little sleep the day I sat down to read Scarletti Curse I didn't stop until I had read every page.Ms. Feehan's gothic bears her trademark paranormal touch. The hero Don Giovanni Scarletti has telepathic abilities and the heroine Nicoletta has healing abilities. While helping the Don's sick niece Nicoletta catches the eye of the Giovanni who decides that he wants her for his bride. Nicoletta is less than thrilled at that honor since both her mother and aunt were killed under suspicious circumstances while employed at Palazzo Scarletti a.k.a Palazzo della Morte (palace of death). Thus begins the tale of our fair hero and heroine. Will the Don be able to win Nicoletta`s heart? Should Nicoletta trust Giovanni? Will Nicoletta be the next victim of the Scarletti curse? What dark secret is the Scarletti family hiding? Strap up and get ready for one heck of ride as Nicoletta and Giovanni learn things that they never expected about themselves and each other.Looking forward to reading more from this author. ",5.0

" I really love The Scarletti Curse having reread it for more than 5 times I believe.The pacing is good with enough action excitement and unconditional love (a necessity to destroy the evil curse at work).The book starts with village girl Nicoletta being summoned to accompany the village 'healer' Maria Pia who raised Nicoletta since her mother's death to the Scarletti Palazzo. They keep this charade to prevent the people at the palazzo knowing about Nicoletta's extraordinary healing powers (this heritage is explained in the Carpathian book 'Dark Symphony in which the lifemate is a descendant of the main characters/couple). As Maria Pia is a midwife herself this causes no problem.At the palazzo the patients turned out to be Don Giovanni Scarletti and his niece Sofia suffering from food poisoning. While both 'healer' and assistant do their work Don Scarletti keeps observing Nicoletta asking her questions when Maria Pia fell asleep and after many dissatisfying non-answers says 'I am not so blind as you and the healer seem to think'!A few days later the 'healer' and assistant were summoned to the palazzo again but this time Nicoletta knows that no one is ill. Maria Pia therefore went back to the Palazzo with another assistant but this assistant is old and when asked about Nicoletta kept telling the Don how wonderful and extraordinary she really is. This gives Don Giovanni a reason to choose a bride at The Bridal Convent. His choice is Nicoletta who gets escorted (begging and struggling) back to the palazzo by the Don.In the following days up to and after the wedding arguments heat up a few murders commited the staff gossip while Nicoletta grows into the role of the Lady of the Palazzo. ",5.0
" What an excellent book. Great use of characters and character growth. The chracters are revealed slowly in layers. Multidimensional supporting characters. There are a pair of young girls that are so well created you can hear the russle of their gowns and the patter of their feet running down the palazzo's corridors. A mystery that grows slowly throughout the book. Wonderful sense of the time and place. I have cried 3 times while reading this book.The level of mystery and intrigue reminds me of her Ghostwalker series which has the same depth of conspiracy interwoven into the romance.This is certainly one of Christine Feehan's defining works.

" The Scarletti Curse is absolutely wonderful. Ms. Feehan once again created a lively well written work that stand far apart from her Dark series (which I also adore). With complex and dark characters this book has quite a lot of bite and more than enough romance for a true fan of Christine's work. I highly recommend this book for one and all. ",5.0
" If you're a fan of Christine Feehan you already know some of the elements you'll find in this book - beautiful courageous spirited heroine and strong intelligent handsome tortured hero. Christine Feehan has put these elements in play in such exciting ways in her Dark series that she's raised the bar incredibly for Paranormal romance. It's hard to picture anyone writing about noble vampire-like creatures in a more exciting sensuous just flat out stunning way. This book though not about the vampire-like beings in her others adds an exciting Gothic twist to Christine's writing and a clever mystery to her incredibly involving characterizations. The suspenseful ending is very exciting and the reader is not sure until the end how the book will resolve. I particularly loved Nicoletta's free-spirited naturalist perspective; her grounded innocence makes such a compelling counterpoint to Don Scarletti's cursed magnificence. I own every Christine Feehan book and recommend them ALL. This is a fitting addition to her wonderful writing. ",5.0

Problem with wanting to marry her is all the women his family has chosen for their brides ends up dead. But he is not going to let that stop him from getting Nicoletta.

" I have read almost all of Ms. Feehan's books but I think this has become one of my favorites. I was kind of hesitant to buy it because it wasn't part of the Dark Series and I wasn't sure I'd like it. Once I saw the price though I decided to take a chance. After reading the first chapter I knew my worries were TOTALLY unfounded. I was hooked! And to my surprise the story is about an ancestor of Antonietta Scarletti (the female lead of 'Dark Symphony'). I could NOT put it down! I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys romance novels or anyone who likes a good read. ",5.0

" While I am not usually a fan of books where the hero is overly domineering I must concede that Christine Feehan writes so well that I enjoy her novels even though the men are so controlling and obsessive it would be frightening in real life.'The Scarletti Curse' is not a part of the Carpathian series but I found myself enjoying it as much if not more. The heroine is a healer but in a time where she could be burned at the stake should this secret gift be discovered. In order to protect herself she pretends to be a healers apprentice. Unfortunately the one man she wishes to hide this talent from Giovanni Scarletti is not fooled.Like much of Feehan's work the story is very gothic in feel and the villain(s) are truly horrible. While the hero is constantly swooping in and saving the heroine it becomes more of a joke between the two of them than a tiresome what-a-stupid-girl scenario.I was leary of this novel after being dissappointed with 'Lair of the Lion.' This novel is much much better. If you like her Carpathian series or are interested in paranormal romance this is a good book to read. ",5.0
" No female whether they are of the blood or through marriage survives THE SCARLETTI CURSE. They all violently die. One of the villagers Nicoletta knows first hand that her own mother was a victim of the curse. Still she lives life to the fullest and uses her abilities to heal people. Her guardian helps hide the secret that Nicoletta has empathic talents by fostering the idea she is just the village healer to keep her safe from Giovanni Scarletti.However the kind Nicoletta helps cure ailing lass suffering from dining on a contaminated meal with her uncle Giovanni. He immediately realizes that Nicoletta is his life mate and will protect her from his enemies but will his need to keep her safe end up making him follow the footsteps of his ancestors who loved so deep they killed for love?Though there is a political sidebar that adds suspense to the tale this gothic story line belongs to the two lead characters. Nicoletta is the classic heroine willing to do the right thing even at the cost of her own life. Giovanni is the dark brooding alpha male wanting to also do the right thing for his people and especially his beloved. Toss on top of the key theme a bit of the paranormal and readers have Christine Feehan's intrepid venture outside the Carpathian realm (see her 'Dark' series) into a totally different sub-genre that proves she is a versatile talent who deserves a wide readership.Harriet Klausner ",5.0
" The ancient dons worshipped the old gods honoring their pagan heritage and building the palazzo in defiance of the Holy Church. Two centuries ago the Scarletti family was cursed and now for years there have been rumors of murders and assignations. Indeed the palazzo itself feels evil to sensitive Nicoletta a woman who is known to be 'different' in her gifts to heal to listen to the wind to sense danger. So when the mesmerizing Don Scarletti chooses her to be his bride Nicoletta knows every bride who entered the palazzo is doomed.Nicoletta roamed the hills surrounding her village before the don's choice of her curtailed her activities to the palazzo. She had sworn no man would command her but when she fled her home to hide the don followed her luring her with his own gift. The don's darkly sensual voice erotic and seductive entices her imagination and her womanhood linking her to the man she would flee.Don Scarletti knows well the dangers that lurk upon his land. Political upheaval and family secrets threaten the woman he takes as wife as well as the others dependent upon him. He carefully guards his own gifts from others than his chosen bride. Only Nicoletta can reach through his icy aloofness to the passionate man concealed within.As a new comer to Christine Feehan's work I had very high expectations based on other reader's reactions and I am not disappointed. Written with a sensuous style a deep understanding for history and a respect for both Christianity and Paganism THE SCARLETTI CURSE contains a fast paced plot and dynamic characterizations. All the classic gothic elements keep the pages turning including the dark castle with gargoyles warnings from natural elements portents from ravens secret passageways family secrets and multiple dead wives. Further the strong heroine isn't too perfect; the troubled hero still maintains his strength amid his human failings while the gothic elements lend the perfect depth and shadow. Very highly recommended. ",5.0
" From the back of the book...Strange twisted cravings and hideous gargoyles adorned the palazzo of the great Scarletti family. But a still more fearful secret lurked within its storm-tossed turrets. For every bride who entered its forbidding walls was doomed to leave in a casket.Mystical and unfettered Nicoletta had no terror of ancient curses and no fear of marriage...until she looked into the dark mesmerizing eyes of Don Scarletti. She had sworn no man would command her had thought her gift of healing set her apart but his was the right to choose a bride from among his people. And he had chosen her.Compelled by duty drawn by desire she gave her body into his keeping and prayed the powerful tormented Don would be her heart's destiny and not her soul's demise. ",5.0
" I continue to love the work of Ms Feehan. She is a wonderful storyteller. Her books never seem to get old and tired.Giovanni and Nicolette come together to make a wonderful love story. They are both 'different' in a world were those differences could get them burned at the stake. Giovanni can read and talk to peoples minds. Nicolette has the ability to heal with her hands. They come together over a child's sick bed.Giovanni realizes that Nicolette is the women he has been dreaming about and is determine to marry her. She is his light in the darkness that seems to surround him and his family.Nicolette is a free spirit that runs around in bare feet. Raising plants for medicine and enjoying her freedom. She always seems to be in trouble.This is a warm and wonderful story that everyone should read. ",5.0

" Hawthorne's gentle charming collection of classic myths retold for the children of his day is a neglected classic. Addressing the reader in personable Victorian fashion his prose is clear and beautiful. Consider this sample",5.0
" Once upon a time (I was about 8) a family friend handed down his Collier's Junior Classic series to me - each volume is a glorious hodgepodge of short stories from here there and everywhere. I got to be very fond of Greek mythology especially 'The Chimaera' and 'The Miraculous Pitcher' since the Collier retellings of their respective legends were much more lively than the ordinary.Alas I forgot the name of the author of 'The Chimaera' and even that my favourite versions of the myths were all written by the same person. Some talented guy writing for the series no doubt I would have said if I'd thought about it. A couple of years ago I started browsing through an impressive-looking illustrated volume of mythology in a bookstore (which you now see before you). Whoa. 'Scarlet Letter' Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote *THESE*?His retellings of Greek myths were originally spread over 2 volumes (the other being _Tanglewood Tales_) but they can be obtained in a single volume these days. I can personally do without the gang of Tanglewood kids providing the official audience for the stories-within-a-story or the defense against critics put into the mouth of the storyteller Eustace Bright but then I want more space for more myths. ",5.0
" One day last week I could not even after hours of deliberation (the snow had made engagements scarce) decide what book to read next. I finally came upon this little volume on the end of my parent's bookshelf and decided to give it try. How could I have known what charms were in store? I felt like a little girl again and as Eustace Bright the ambitious college student who narrates these tales held his little auditors in awe my eyes too were wide with wonder. It truly is a 'wonder book' full of high fantasy thrilling action and the inimitable imagery of a master. Though geared towards 'boys and girls' Hawthorne explains in his introduction that 'children possess an unestimated sensibility to whatever is deep or high in imagination or feeling so long as it is simple . . . It is only the artificial and complex that bewilder them.' Indeed; the book hardly condescends and so will gently stretch the middle-grader's vocabulary. But readers -- or listeners -- of all ages will delight in this collection of tales for I was equally if not more entertained by the introductories and postludes to each story which relate the antics and dialogue of Eustace and the little children he entertains. These interludes also expand the stories by slipping in commentary and interpretation.Don't pass this one by; it will truly win your heart whoever you may be! ",5.0
" I ordered this book as part of a third grade curriculum for my son. These Everyman titles are really wonderful-- beautiful binding heavy pages amazing illustrations. I was not disappointed with this book. It is the kind of book we will read again and again and hopefully pass on to the next generation. Hawthorne's rendition of the myths and fables is classic and engaging and Rackham's illustrations are worth the price on their own. ",5.0
" If you've read Hawthorne's longer works you might be surprised by the storytelling fun and energy he puts into this shorter book aimed at boys and girls of all ages 8 to 80 who love a good yarn. Imagine yourself on a whispery wintery day sledding on the hillsides with friends. Or imagine yourself gathered with the kids on the front porch on a golden summery afternoon. Now add to these settings Hawthorne's inventive narrator Eustace Bright who gathers the children round on that hillside or porch and gives them the classic myths with his own unique spins.If you think you know the stories of King Midas and his golden touch of Hercules' exploits of Medusa you have here the chance to rediscover them in child-friendly yet fully adventurous form through the skills of Mr. Nathaniel Hawthorne. He gives the old tales a lot of charm makes them palatable for younger kids and weaves in lessons of ethics and morality and courage. I have always appreciated Hawthorne's more thought-provoking writings but here I find another side to the man and the writer that is magical and light. To add to the wonder I not only have the paperback version but also read this in an e-book format enjoying the beautiful drawings of Arthur Rackham.I've long been a fan of Hawthorne's short stories. While he plays out some amazing themes and characters in 'A Scarlet Letter' 'House of the Seven Gables' and even 'The Blithedale Romance' he excels in his shorter tales where the prose has less room to run off track and the themes are better addressed. He seems serious in most of his writing with only hints of his humor and playfulness but in 'A Wonder Book for Boys and Girls' we find a side of Hawthorne that's hard not to adore. ",5.0

" This is a great kid's desk. After 3 years of heavy use the desk continues to work great and has retained it's durability. It's the the perfect size for kids ages 4-9 years old to do their homework or other projects. The built in hutch is fantastic for organizing papers homework workbooks etc. It is easy to assemble and the honey color looks great. It is neutral enough to work with any color scheme. Although it may seem on the pricey side for a kids desk if you do any comparison shopping you will find that is well worth the money. The quality and durability is well worth it. ",5.0
" Impressive quality. Solid wood really nicely evenly stained wood with excellent layout clear instructions and very nicely packaged parts for assembly. A beautiful set. My daughter (almost 6yrs old) is going to be amazed when she sees it in the place where her old/antiquated art table used to be.Another selling point is the customer service at KidKraft. I noted that the overall quality and finish was really great except for one piece of the front of the hutch which was pretty good but had an imperfection that was filled in with well-colormatched well-sanded wood filler. My daughter would not have noticed it but it bothered me. I decided to call customer service an 800 number to see if they'd have any opinion on it. I figured they'd explain that wood is wood is never perfect that kind of thing is within tolerances et cetera... but before I even finished describing the issue the very kind rep (a live person who answered on the first ring - wow!) was asking me for my shipping address apologizing and stating they'd get a perfect piece out to me right away. She told me to go ahead and assemble the pieces that I had then when the new piece comes just swap it in without even dealing with sending back to them the imperfect piece. Just like that. Done. Instead of me apologizing and pleading my case SHE was apologizing and stated that she would personally make sure that I'd be satisfied.Amazing. ",5.0
" This item arrived well packed and undamaged. It looks exactly like the picture was fairly easy to assemble and is sturdy and well made. Of course it is an 'assembly required' piece of furniture but once put together it looks like a really nice quality piece. My daughter loves it. It is sized for a child and is too small for an adult. I think she'll be able to use it through age 11 or 12. It also has a convenient hole in the back of the hutch for her computer wire to poke through. I looked at this item EVERYWHERE including eBay and Amazon was the cheapest of all. The chair comes included so don't buy an extra chair separately! ",5.0

It is a great size for our 3 and 5 year old and I believe will fit them well for many more years. My wife just started homeschooling our 5 year old and the desk works great. Very stable you'll love it. We have no complaints at all. Some of the information as far as heights go is a little confusing in the description. The top of the desk is just shy of 24' and the top of the hutch is just shy of 30'. As far as the chair goes the seat itself is about 14' so it is all sized quite well for your little ones. They don't have to sit on thier knees to work at their desk. You can't go wrong with this one. And you will not find a better bargian.

I searched high and low and this is the best deal. ",5.0
" This desk is definitely worth the money. My daughter wanted a white desk with a hutch and had picked out many over [...] not including the chair. I ordered this one without her knowing and at first she was upset because the hutch is not that big. But once it was assembled she loves it. She is 8 and loves the little cubbies in the hutch. Everything is packaged nicely and there was not one scratch or ding or funny smells. The hardware had everything you needed (no extras) in separate baggies for the chair and desk. I put it together myself in about 1 hour. We did replace the knob with a blue glass knob from the hardware store just to make it a little more unique I guess and it looks great. With free supersaver shipping and no sales tax there is no better buy out there. Trust me I have looked! ",5.0

I think they will be great as my kids get older too whether they want to just use it as a writing desk or to put a laptop or computer screen and keyboard on them. Highly recommend these desks and at a great price.

We did change the knob (the knob it came with was a simple wooden knob. Not horrible but for a couple of dollars at the hardware store you can get a beautiful knob.)

" I purchased this desk for my 7-year old grandson and while it wasn't the most exciting Christmas present he received it was probably one of the most practical (which is why I gave it a low score on 'fun'). It's a very nice piece of furniture and appears to be very sturdy. He loves having all his 'stuff' for school in one place and is now able to do his homework in the peace and quiet of his room. The desk appeared a little larger than we had envisioned (knowing the dimensions doesn't quite prepare you for the actual 'impact' of the item in the room) but it ended up fitting quite nicely in his room. I would say that after an average-size child reaches age nine or ten this desk would be too small. ",5.0

" When I think of Heart's 1985 self-titled album I feel it should be renamed 'Resurgence'! Meaning this was their 'comeback' album after what everyone thought they were just wilting and fading away several years earlier. It seems like when Heart was popular with 'Dreamboat Annie' ten years earlier they were on top to stay. However when the 1980s began many rock artists were forgotten and to never be heard from again. Not Heart! Sure they were lost in the early 80s because of the MTV explosion and the world was living on 'Thriller'. Capitol's bold gamble paid off",5.0
" In 1985Heart made their Capitol Records debut with their self-titled album. The band themselves debuted in 1976 on Epic. They were dropped from Epic in 1983following the release of PASSIONWORKS. Bass guitarist Mark Andes was a member of the disbanded Firefallwhose hits included JUST REMEMBER I LOVE YOU and YOU ARE THE WOMAN. Now for the songs",5.0
" This is the best Heart album ever made in my opinion. I grew up listening to Heart and I still listen to them. I saw Ann and Nancy in concert last year they were awsome as usual. My favorite song is 'These Dreams'. Another good song is 'What About Love'. Heart has had numerous #1 hits and it's amazing people still love to listen to them. ",5.0
" I liked this album since it debuted. The radio stations in Chicago played the hell out of the singles. 9 good songs. The only one I didn't care for is ' What He Don't Know'.Ann was gaining alot of weight around this time and in the video's her body is blocked by props on stage or the camera zooms in for jsut head shots of her singing. She's still got a strong powerful voice. ",5.0
" I honestly think that the first song I ever heard was either 'If Looks Could Kill' or 'What About Love'. At the time I would've only been two or three but my older brother and sister had this record. I stole it from one of them and ever since Heart has been my favorite band of all time. This album is without a doubt their best work ever. The only slight weak spot being 'Nobody Home' but it's still a good song. It just doesn't fit the album very well. Ann's voice is raw and ethereal and the way Nancy plays the guitar is too great for words. So if you love this kind of music. Then you must have this record in your collection.Also Recommended",5.0
" In late 1984 after Ann Wilson had success with Mike Reno (lead singer of Loverboy) on their duet 'Almost Paradise' for the 1984 film 'Footloose' Heart regrouped with Ann Wilson Nancy Wilson Howard Leese Mark Andes and Denny Carmassi to start recording another album. Their last two albums had flopped and they had decided to go in another direction",5.0
" This is the album that brought Heart back on top of the scene. They scored many top ten hits here and there first number one hit 'These Dreams'. I personally think this is there best work to date and has some of the best songs on it. 'Never' is my favorite song on the album. I am not a huge Heart fan so it does not bother me as much they sold out but as long as they made good music it doesn't really matter. i recommend this album as Heart's best album to date. ",5.0
" Heart was back and bigger than ever. 'Heart' was a last ditch effort to keep the band together. If it failed Heart would no longer exist. Well history shows what happened.MTV made four videos for this album and they made Nancy Wilson every teenager's dream girl. Ann was always my favorite sister and she looked real good too. MTV milked this album for all it was worth and Heart was now an official '80's band' like it or not. This album brought a breath of life into their career that seemed to be standing still.Besides the singles I always liked 'The Wolf' but 'Shell Shock' was by far the hardest loudest most rockin' tune on the whole album.

" What The Cure was to new wave/punk Heart was to rock n' roll. These songs overflowed with all the passion excitement romance and love that typical meat and potatoes male rockstars of the era felt too embarrassed to express. On this album Heart is easy listening hard rock and progressive new wave pop all at the same time. There's an excellent balance of guitar and synth with thrillingly uplifting moments and heart-melting ballads. The Wilson sister's vocals are lush throughout but what really stands out are the songs themselves.'If Looks Could Kill' is a solid dramatic rocker. 'What About Love' is a dynamic ballad that features Grace Slick on backround vocals. Howard Leese lays a fine guitar solo. The last half minute pulsates double time with unbelievable excitement and conviction. You'll continue to hear the song in your head even after you turn off your stereo. 'Never' is sexy and serious at the same time.Written by Bernie Taupin 'These Dreams' has to be among the very best ballads of the 80's. This is Heart at its most romantic and seductive. It's medieval lyrical imagery gives it a timeless appeal. The song emblazons a gorgeous fantasy world upon your emotions. It's a better four minutes than any drug could ever give you.'The Wolf' uses primal imagry to put down the unwanted advances of sleazy guys. It's guitar solo will floor you with a determined and indomitable hopefullness! 'All Eyes' scores again with an alternately sexy seductiveness and lovestruck passion. 'You don't have to say a word to get a hold of me/take me...shake me/Burning gravity baby/Look at me look at me'. What guy wouldn't love to hear those words from his girlfriend? And there's another triumphant guitar solo that's brimming with happiness. The plaintive ballad 'Nobody Home' is beautiful.'Nothin' At All' has a pure pop genius. It's got that top of the world 80's happiness to it. The guitar solo is simple yet very satisfying. The almost country 'What He Don't Know' is a decent soft rock ballad. The closer 'Shell Shock' is a bit cheesy but displays an ample pop rock sensibility.This album is very happy warm and hopefull. But unlike the shallowness of most pop music it's happy in a deep and meaningful way. When you feel like the daily grind has bled away your passion this album is the antidote. ",5.0
" If there was a recording or type of music that represents the music of my life it would be mid-'80s Heart music. This music affected me more than any other recordings I ever bought. I have never listened to a recording so many times as I did this 1985 release after buying it.It's a high-powered rock recording with power ballads mixed in. I saw a Heart arena stage show in NorfolkVA in September of 1985 and may lightning strike me dead if I am not 101% honest in saying that I have never been so stunned impressed blown away awestruck mesmerizedor captivated by anything in life like I was by Ann Wilson's lightning bolt performance and stupendously glorified stage appearance along with Heart's incredible stage energy and unmatched professionalism in the live execution of this 1985 recording.Every song on here is good. Too bad there isn't a DVD of Heart's 1985 music. Over twenty years ago this recording came out and I am still so profoundly affected by this recording & Heart's 1985 show. Ann & Nancy really struck gold recording these songs and their live `85 performance put me in a state of awe that I never felt before or after this show. I have never been thrilled like that by anything ever! Heart's 1985 recording is more than just music to me it was an unforgettable life experience that's part of me forever. This CD is a memory picture of that experience.Hopefully a Heart 1985 CD will come out that has bonus mid 1980s songs on it (like 'Love Takes Over' which is on youtube as of 2011). I still have the cassette for this recording and can attest that this cd sounds like instruments are missing or severely faded especially on 'If Looks Could Kill.' Something isn't right with the process that put this recording on a cd. ",5.0

" Heart 'Heart' #1 (1985).The airbrushed Heart on the cover of their debut album with Capitol in 1985 was quite a shock but the music is what mattered and they delivered. The album begins with the synth rocker 'If Looks Could Kill' #54 hot 100 they reached the top 10 again (after 5 years) with the power ballad 'What About Love' #10 hot 100 and #3 MSR. 'Never' #4 hot 100 and #2 MSR is a nice little pop rocker. Sister Nancy sings on the sleepy power ballad 'These Dreams' #1 hot 100 (their first #1) and #2 MSR. The 80's sounding hard rock of 'Wolf' 'All Eyes' and 'Shell Shock'. You also get the not mentioned enough 'Nobody Home'. 'Nothin' At All' #10 hot 100 and #6 MSR another fine pop-rocker. The only song that doesn't hit home was 'What He Don't Know'. They would come back two years later in 1987 with 'Bad Animals'. ",5.0

Not only did the Wilson sisters look totally gorgeous (Nancy practically makes love to her guitar as she throws her legs around in the videos for this album) but they selected a series of songs which reflected the popularity of soft rockl at the time without abandoning their vocal & musical prowess. 5 million album sales later proved that Heart had returned with style while delivering both a commercial & gutsy opus. What are now rock classix These Dreams (US no.1 & UK Top 10) & What About Love (US & UK Top 10) are contained here plus the uplifting Never (US & UK Top 10). The album is consistent with some gorgeous songs such as Nobody Home & some really gutsy rockers such as If Lools Could Kill (which remains a live! favourite) & Nothin' At All (another US Top 10 hit). The only really awful track is The Wolf which tries hard to be uniques but is really dreadful. The fportunate thing is that al other 9 tracks are that good that you forgive Heart that mishap. Moreover considering the immense leap in their creative & commercial fortunes on this album the album is destined to be a classic anyway! ",5.0
" I grew up listening to Heart on the radio and now they're still one of my favorite groups and my favorite female group of all time without a doubt. This is their best album that they made in my opinion. 'These Dreams' and 'Nothin' At All' have got to be 2 of my favorite songs ever.All the other songs even the ones that weren't hits are also good. If you're a Heart fan I recommend picking this one up without a second thought. If you can find it I would also recommend getting These Dreams",5.0
" While some think 'Heart' was nothing more than pop record are just wrong! This is one of rocks finest moments! Heart rocked with this lp in 1985 and introduced them to a wider audience Four big hits! Ann & Nancy and the band picked strong material for this project and 21yrs later(wow)it still hold up! (two of the girls on american idol have done good covers of two of the songs) even the cover photo was hot! ",5.0
" After the self titled album was released Hearts' domination of female rock was thundered home. Sadly Heart went back into the studio and ruined a couple of songs changing the guitar solo entirely on 'Nothing At All' adding some overdriven guitar power chords and changing vocal parts in 'Never'. Do not buy the Original Recording version thinking you are getting the original recording either. Heart felt that the songs were too reliant on keyboards and synths after the fact went back into the studio and added more guitars and even changing vocals. ie in 'Never' Ann originally sang the part 'walk those legs right over here'. After the studio revisit it turned into a pouty kinda spoken command 'walk those legs right over here. If you search hard enough you might find an old cassette of the original recording. I don't know how to differentiate before buying so good luck. Not to be nitpicking but when you get used to hearing a certain version you don't want it changed. ",5.0

" I suffer from chronic joint pain and severe headaches. My doctor recommened that I look into a maternity body pillow similar to this product since I could use it to support my back and hips when i sleep on my side and that by using the u-shaped pillow as my only neck and head pillow ease the muscle tension that aggravated my headaches. He was so right! I purchased this product the Comfort U pillow and once I modified a bit it was perfect. it tends to be a little too long on the sides and as a result it flattens out where your legs rest on it. It is also a little underfilled. To correct that I got two elastic hair bands and turned the U upside down so it was resting on the U. I then took the ends and shook all the stuffing down each arm until I had siz to 8 inches of empty pilow case. I wrapped the hair elastics around the ends pinching the empty part shut so that the filling couldn't get back in there. When I patted the pillow down to make the stuffing even it was nice and firm no longer had a tendency to go flat. It's an easy thing to do if you want a firmer pillow.That said I recommend that you Google a different store called 'the Comfort Store' because they sell this for the same exact price but offer free shipping which will save you over $30. be aware that the Comfort U pillow comes with one white pillow case shaped to fit the pillow. You can purchase extra pillow cases for aboyt $34. I bought one in beige and I liked it much better than the white one. it matched my yellow floral bedding. They offer a blue pillow case as well (sold separately). The money you save on shipping by buying from the Comfort Store can buy you an extra pillow case!Whatever you do consider getting this if you are a side sleeper stuffing pillows behind your back and between your legs for support. Once you get used to sleepig with this pillow with your arm underneath it and your other arm over it you'll notice you awaken less during the night to turn. My only complaint and it is a minor one is that the pillow tends to reflect your body heat back to you. I am always too warm even in airconditioning so I found cooling a gel pack in the freezer for half an hour and sliding that between my forehead and the pillow solves that problem quickly. That might not even be a problem for other people. trust me if you have joint pain this pillow is the solution. ",5.0
" I have fibromyalgia restless leg syndrome and endure much pain during the night. It was totally impossible for me to get comfortable until the Comfort U Pillow was delivered to my door. I can honestly say that it truly does help me get a better night sleep in addition to decreasing the pain. This pillow has brought me many painfree nights of sleep. ",5.0
" Out of all the products I bought for my pregnancy this was by far the best. I slept comfortably throughout my 9 mos. and still use it today. The only downfall is that your bedfellow might feel neglected. ",5.0
" I originally purchased this for my pregnancy as I was using 5+ pillows for support and i was tired of chasing them as they fell off the bed all night long. I loved the support and have slept with it ever since. (i even take it with me on trips.) its great because of the refluff-able fill and because you can roll over and not have to move it. I have yet to wash it in the laundermat and see how it turns out.one con because of its size it can be difficult to fluff... do it in the morning while you have energy not at night when you're ready to go to bed.

" This is an awesome product! I was hesitant to spend so much money on a pillow but it is worth every penny!!! I have fibromyalgia & I was pregnant when my husband ordered this pillow for me. It is wonderful. I wish I would have bought it years ago. I sleep so much better now. It is great for fibromyalgia sufferers & pregnant women. ",5.0
" I am starting my fifth month of pregnancy and bought the pillow to get used to sleeping on my sides. At first I was scared of the size and concerned it might bother my husband and my little dog that sleeps next to me. I tried it and absolutely loved it.

I am 5'11' so it is not to long for me and the pillow is just the right height for my head too. I am also a cold sleeper so the body heat reflection that another reviewer noted is a plus for me!

" I have trigger point and muscle tension problems and the extra support from the comfort U pillow has helped me sleep much more comfortably. I like to sleep on my side and realized that I was holding too much tension in my back and not relaxing enough. Now I just cocoon myself into my comfort U and tuck it in along my back and I can relax more deeply. I hate to go anywhere without it even tho' it is rather big and bulky to try to take anywhere. At first I thought it was a lot to spend on a pillow but it has been worth it. Previously I had used body pillows but the comfort U gives far more coverage and I don't have to roll my a body pillow over with me each time I roll over and my comfort U hasn't gone flat like the previous body pillow tended to do. I admit it would have been nice to have when I was pregnant too but those days are long gone. ",5.0

" It is our good fortune this collection exists to showcase the tragically ignored Payne.

" Why The Boys' self-titled release isn't universally recognized as one of the essential albums that defined the 70's punk rock phenomenon will remain beyond me. Maybe they didn't fit in because they didn't conform to the punk 'look' and because they were not sponsored by the right people. They were regarded as the Beatles of punk. The funny thing is that they were actually more punk than most bands of the movement. As far as I'm concerned their first album is the best punk rock album to come out of '77 UK. The sheer energy and overall drive of the music was nearly unparalleled at the time far ahead of the Pistols and the Clash.The music here is passionate and it has attitude; it is somewhat remniscient of the Dead Boys. This is true oldschool punk rock here the dirty kind of non-political I-don't-care rock'n'roll that set the foundation for the rest of the movement. The music is loud and energetic and the songwriting is top-notch almost too good to be punk (this may have been a reason why they were cast out). The Boys take no prisoners as they churn out classic after classic song. From the all-out rebellion that is the opener Sick On You to the f***-everything attitude of I Don't Care to the amazing Living in the City (which the Sex Pistols were never quite able to outdo in terms of raw power) you'll be turning this album up louder and louder until you can't hear anything else around you but you won't even care to.There are no weak songs here. Catchy riffs and hooks are all over the place in just about every song. This isn't punk for the sake of punk this is quality rock'n'roll that also has all the elements of punk including loud vocals distorted guitars and definitely an overall feel of youth aggression. Whereas other bands were busy coloring their hair and sticking safety pins on their clothes The Boys channeled the spirit of punk into the music itself. Do yourself a favor and buy this album if you want to hear the real deal. ",5.0

" We met Dr. Smith when recently in the Amazon in Peru. She cured my husband's plantar fascitis with a shot of lidocaine which we feel enabled him to walk properly and thus stretch the fachitis. It cost 25cents for the lidocaine and needle and he had spent way more of that in the States with a cordisone shotMRI special night boot creams to rub on his foot etc. In any event we love this woman and have begun a correspondence with her and her foundation. Her book tells how she left a thriving practice in Wisconsin to come to the Amazon and open a clinic. She is a very special lady. Her story moves quickly and is interesting. If you ever were tempted to do good in the world this woman takes you step by step on her journey. Truth is often better than fiction. ",5.0

" This is an inspiring book that's a pleasure to read. It gives the reader the vicarious enjoyment of being part of a noble endeavor. In an age of 'road rage' and the obsessive accumulation of more and more things (which often do not make us happy) it's exhilarating to experience a taste of Dr. Linnea's life.Dr. Linnea shows us how one can give up almost all the material possessions and creature comforts of the modern world and still find meaning happiness and personal fulfillment. Dr. Linnea has created for herself a significant life. A life with much to teach a troubled world.While missionaries have long sacrificed themselves to serve God win the eternal salvation of lost souls and earn a place in the pantheon of saints Dr. Linnea does it for the pure humanity of the effort. Goodness is indeed its own reward in this Amazon outpost.Because of Dr. Linnea's 'wonderful life' many lives have been enriched and some even saved. More importantly countless hours of suffering have been alleviated. This is the most humane thing",5.0
" As the author of a book about the same region HIDDEN AMAZON I found Linnea Smith's book fascinating. From Wisconsin Linnea tells why she has gone to the Amazon (she's still there) and how she feels about the conditions the jungle and the people. Perhaps most instructive is her detailed account of the medical conditions she encounters and how she treats them under the most primitive conditions. She works lives and eats at Explorama Lodge a popular stop for trekkers in the area. This is one of the few jungle lodges with a doctor on the staff. And LA DOCTORA is one of the best books about the rain forest and its medical services. ",5.0
" I met Dr Smith last month at her new clinic while vacationing on the Amazon River. This book was especially meaningful since we were in many of the places she talks about. I can understand completely why she came to the region for a vaction but never left. Her book provides a beautiful insight into the Amazon region and it's people. The Peruvian people in the Amazon have very little by American standards but they appear to be very content and happy with the lives they lead. And she chronicles this beautifully in her book both the positive and the negative aspects of practicing with very little equipment or supplies.She provides from an outsiders perspectivethe problems with practicing medicine not knowing the language and have to go thru so much 'red tape' to get the supplies and the Peruvian medical degree needed to legally treat the people she cared about.Fortunately she has been able to develop a great support system in Wisconsin people who are able to acquire the supplies needed to built and outfit her new clinic. She is a testament to the medical profession one who practice for the love of it after falling in love with one of the most beautiful areas of the world.A fantastic diary of a doctor making a real difference in the lives of people who had only the 'medicine men' of the Amazon...

You dont run into too many albums this complete from 1st track to the last. the sparse instamentation and productioin are such the canvas for Lhasa to paint her musical/vocal paintings you hear and feel such passion fire hunger distain in her voice it pulls you in and you cant help it. a nod to her collaborator Yves Desrosiers-what a fantastic musicain on a level few others achieve- playing multiple instraments with such a deft touch and a knowledge of where there place should be in the overall mix of the songs.

When shopping for a speakers this was one of the discs I always used as a reference. ",5.0
" Lhasa's voice is simply haunting. I cannot find any other way to describe it. Her interpretation although I would say it sounds extremely personal it is so emotional that it reaches way beyond her inner sanctum into the ears of any listener. The lack of major musical arrangements allows her voice to be heard in every breath. I can only compare her to Lila Dows in terms of her delivery. This album is a must have for any serious collector of world music and if you don't have any of Lila Downs I suggest you get hers too. ",5.0

If you want to spend a very very emotional moment get the CD it's a very good investissment. Special greatings to Yves Desrosiers guitarist and arranger. One of the best ones I can swear. My life has really changed since I've heard this voice so do the same and enjoy!! ",5.0
" With the recent release of Lhasa's new album I thought I'd take a moment to say how much I've loved this one. I happened upon it in a Borders listening station. It was during the brief flash of public interest in Cuban music and I guess somebody thought it fitted the mood. Well bless them for thinking so for I otherwise would never have heard it.I was pretty well sold by the first track. I had never heard such a 'rainy' song - it is held together with the rhythm of rain and water and Lhasa's voice was instantly enrapturing like as (I think) Susan Power wrote 'liquid sorrow beaded on her vocal cords.' (She said that of Patsy Cline but the impression is the same.)Thank goodness for the bilingual liner notes - my four years of high school Spanish helped me catch the occasional phrase but these lyrics are too good to be misunderstood",5.0

I'm allways on the lookout for interesting artists being one myself and I've been involved in the music industry for a long time working in a recording studio. I can't tell you 'Buy This' because I think it is great-that's a personal opinion. But I can tell you 'Buy this' because I like it and so will you and anyone else you play it to.

" Este Cd ha sido mi sorpresa del ano 2006 Puede ser un CD de musica mejicana una obra maestra???. Si la respuesta es YES entonces La Llorona='Obra maestra'. Lhasa no tiene una voz de las que podriamos calificar de 'bonita' pero si que es carismatica y tremendamente expresiva. Si a ello anadimos que las canciones presentan unas letras originales con sentido y mensaje unos ritmos que se meten en tu sangre y te acompanan alla adonde vayas unos arreglos musicales 'teatrales' en el mejor sentido del termino y unos instrumentos musicales irreprochablemente bien tocados el resultado dificilmente puede mejorarse. No tengo ni idea si Lhasa esta arriba o abajo en el raking de las cantantes superventas. Pero si es lo primero....es logicoy si es lo segundo...esperemos que tarde o temprano LHASA se haga justicia con tu forma de enteder la musica. ",5.0

" I recently heard this tape being played in a shop abroad and immediately enquired what it was and ordered it from Amazon the moment I returned home.

" Growing up on the border in South Texas and traveling through much of Mexico over the yeras this recording brought back a lot of memories through De Sela's Rachera style.

" After reading all the rave reviews for the past few years I decided to break down and get this CD. The art cover closed the deal. I was even more impressed to find out she did it. Where to begin describing something so unique and different? There is only one Lhasa de Sala there is no mold so they'll be no copies. The only voices I've heard that remind me of hers are Linda Ronstandt on her excursions into Espanol and Edith Piaf. Listen to the opening track 'De Cara a la Pared' as she hauntingly invites you into her own cabaret joining in as though her voice is a violin softly seductively enticing the listener entry into her world. The comparisons to the two above mentioned artists stop there and really do no justice to her brand of music created with Yves Desprosiers. This is really a collaboration as Desprosiers pens many of the songs with her and plays no less than eight instruments! He also is the producer. Of course the focus is the voice of Lhasa but the guitar and acordian work Desporsiers lend to the CD give it the sidewalk cafe sound. It is not just her vocals and the beautiful arrangements but the cutting lyrics that stand on their strength alone. Although the songs are all entirely in Spanish a non-Spanish speaker can understand the songs because the booklet is bilingual. To say that Lhasa's songs lament would be an understatement the pain comes out in her voice even if you don't understand Spanish. There is a mysterious quality to the songs a spiritual quality music from deep within her soul La Llorona cries out. I like to say which songs I particularly like but all the songs are strong and stand out with individual characteristics. If I had to pick one song it would be 'Los Peces' because of it's theme The Virgin Mary and the simple poetic lyrics she so eloquently demonstrates. The CD is a triumph for a first effort and will probably be hard to match. Although considering the talent and her last words in her acknowledgments 'Viva La Evolucion' she probably will make another stunning piece of music. If you like Gypsyesque-Spanish music tinged with folkloric Argentinian and Mexican melodies soulful interplay into categories undefined but refreshingly fresh this is a CD for you. I suspect Lhasa has much more to say and those that heard this CD will be waiting for her sophmore effort. I should have bought it long ago. ",5.0
" Some of Lhasa's songs on 'La Llorona' sound like they could have come from a Parisian (or Montreal) bistro as easily as from Mexico. Some songs feature accordion and klezmer. Lhasa de Sela is a Mexican-American who lived in Montreal until recently. She grew up travelling across Mexico and the United States in a schoolbus.'La Llorona' (the Wailing Woman) is the name of a legendary Mexican woman who threw her children into the river in her anger and jealousy. The villagers found her dead as well the next morning and her ghost continued to roam the earth wailing for her lost children. That title is appropriate enough for this splendid unexpected collection of songs (only three are not original).Lhasa's voice is haunting much like the mythical wail of 'La Llorona.' There is an urgency and passion in her singing. My favourite song has to be 'De cara a la pared' a haunting waltz with unusual sound effects (rain splashing musical saw). I heard Lhasa for the first time on the Canadian TV series Due South which actually introduced me to a host of lesser-known Canadian talent. I fell in love with the songs and rushed out to buy 'La Llorona.'This is my absolute favourite Spanish-language CD in my collection. It is mysterious uplifting joyful and energetic like Mexico itself. If you're looking for something uniquely Mexican in flavour something mysterious passionate and soulful or simply a change from the ordinary look no further than Lhasa de Sela's 'La Llorona.' ",5.0
" I heard Lhasa de Sela last June in San Francisco at the Lilith Festival. Although I myself am a struggling musician with my own CD's to sell I was enthusiastic enough to want to buy several copies of La Llorona. Unfortunately it wasn't availabe in the US and over the past several months I had searched for a copy to no avail. I was given the CD last week and have listened to it non-stop since.Lhasa and her band are obviously deeply steeped in the traditional music of Mexico Argentina Spain and Central Europe. But she has an authentic and original voice that is able to transform those influences into something truly original and transcendent. When you hear her voice and melodies you know she speaks the truth. She sings like a woman of passion who has no place in her life for cynicism or boredom.Luckily she has a band that knows exactly how to support her vision. The music balances on a strange edge between the haunted loneliness of flamenco and and the topsy-terviness of a small-time circus band.I will be buying several copies of this CD. ",5.0
" I've been listening to Lhasa De Sela all summer in the bistro where I wash dishes. Every time it plays Life seems to become more poignant. I can feel the clients en-Joying their food just that much more we are all trance-ported to the rythmns of this exotic and hauntingly beautiful music.I finally borrowed it to make a tape for myself. I was surprised to realise the singing is in Spanish. The music is just that international that the actual language is of the Heart!I have one critisism",5.0
" This is a masterpiece. Lhasa has a unique and powerful voice - flexible sexy and captivating. So subtle in its beauty it will make you tremble. And the laments will crush your heart.

" It's such a shame how relatively unknown this series is. Granted it does not appeal to everyone as it is a very subtle and quiet series. The genre is historical romance set in Victorian England.

However I only wish they dubbed it as well...I would've loved to hear it in English since the story is set in England after all. ",5.0
" This second set of Emma begins with a textbook example of how to do a recap episode as Vivian's reading of Romeo and Juliet prompts Hakim to coyly recount to the audience what's happened so far in the grand fashion of a Shakespearean prologue. As it ends with him proclaiming that the 'Second Act' is about to begin we're off with the continuing story of Emma and William.As it begins Mrs. Stowner's sad but natural passing has left Hakim - who isn't going to be in England forever - as the only remaining champion of Emma and William's relationship. Emma is fortunately not out on the streets as she's quickly employed by mischievous unconventional German expatriate Dorothea Molders - the woman she met at the train station at the end of the last set - who turns out to be a wonderful employer. Meanwhile to Hakim's disappointment and dismay William proposes to Eleanor in an attempt to please his father and forget Emma.Of course this is a romance so an outrageous coincidence throws Emma and William together again and William realizes his terrible mistake. But by that time Emma has started spending time with Mrs. Molders' gruff but kind handyman Hans with whom she has alot in common - and if William humiliates Eleanor and the Campbell family by breaking the engagement at a late stage it might ruin his father's business his brothers' employment prospects and his sisters' marriage prospects all in one shot in addition to profoundly hurting Eleanor who he doesn't love but considers a friend...Can William convince Emma that they can defy convention as well as convince his family that she is worth the financial downsizing they might all face if he leaves Eleanor for Emma?The answer is no surprise pretty much given away in the new opening sequence and by the fact that Hakim's one-episode prologue is delivered in a fairly light tone in spite of the Romeo and Juliet springboard. It's the execution of the story that's so wonderful. The new cast members are engaging and the scenery of the Molders' country estate expands the Victorian world largely limited to the stunning depiction of London in the first set.Ultimately Emma ranks at the highest level of slice of life anime and is a must for the collection of any fans of that subgenre - as well as period piece fans or even anyone who simply wants a change from the action/adventure genre of most anime.

" Emma season 2 was a surprise. It felt much more grand than its subdued classy first season.In season 2 of Emma our main character moves away from London to get away from the struggle of her affair with a noble and begins life as a maid in Germany where her first day is met with an accusation of theft. Things lead to an emotional but very happy ending and Emma finds herself a favorite among the maids and the masters of the house. Emma's love Will back in London can not get her out of his mind and falls into depression but finds comfort in Miss Campbell a sweet noble girl. The two begin to fall in love. Things seem to go smoothly until Emma and Will's lives cross paths again and the story takes a dramatic turn.Nozomi's release comes with perfect subtitles and a great set of extras. It's a quality release.I can't recommend Emma enough for anyone who loves a good story. ",5.0
" In Season Two we see Emma and William living apart in two households which when you come down to it are both upper crust but have different views on class money power and their places in the universe. As one review pointed out this is a very subtle and quiet anime and many people may not enjoy it or even watch it because it just isn't their thing. Like the first DVD set this one has a extra in the form of a book with few extras within the DVDs themselves. It is also like the first DVDs subtitled. It WOULD have been nice to hear English voices but I don't mind that much. On the other hand would have been nice to hear the German accent of the Molders maybe?Like the first series the plot is realistic and the characters very solid very aware of their place. They are characters of their time and don't pretend to have 21st Century values in a 19th Century world. And I still want to kick William in the butt - he is such a good character that he REALLY generates a emotional response from me. Mostly the need to smack him around.And the character of Monica felt off. The Campbell family came off as so proper and aware of their image...yet they allow the oldest girl to dress and act like that?!?!? Funny thing is I was starting to feel sorry for the Campbell family till...well that be spoilers. I guess the Japanese needed a villain for the piece. I think it would have been better off if they left out the Bad Guy and let the lovers have to deal with the real problem - deciding if their love was important enough to break away from their class their culture and their society. Would they be strong enough to believe in themselves? Sad to say we will never really know. The ending was not as realistic as I would have hoped and did leave some loose ends. True it suggests happy endings for all but we all know that there would be a LOT of fallout from such a ending.Enjoy with good English Black Tea (from India) and scones (from Scotland) and try to give the Maid the day off while you watch the DVDs.

" Emma is working in a new household with a team of other maids and servants. Certainly something she's not used to. William is seeing Eleanor Campbell. It's obvious both sides want marriage between them except for Eleanors father. You'll see why when you watch it. No matter how much William told his father he loved Emma in part one he's totally against him being with her. He wants William to marry into title to secure their place in the gentry.Eleanor is foolishly head-over-heels in love with William even though William has admitted that he just doesn't want to be lonely and likes her company. There is a scene that will floor you about how desperate Eleanor is. She is so naive! I love the blast from the past which tells how Williams father and mother met.William thinks he'll never see Emma again and Emma is accepting living without him and being a maid. Eleanor's older sister tells William off and gives William an ultimatum. William proposes and Eleanor the silly girl says yes. Hakim leaves England. It's not until Emmas new employer visits her friend 'Mrs. Trollope' aka Williams mother that things get more interesting. Emma nearly ruins her chances to go to London again with her employer but when she does go she is to accompany Mrs. Trollope to a party. They dress her up and sure enough she looks like a true blue blood and all eyes are on her.Of course William and Emma meet each other at the party where she learns that he is engaged. My favorite part of the movie! I also love the support from her new employer. She stands back yet encourages the match. From William breaking the engagement Viscount Campbells revenge Emma considering Hans a fellow worker Prince Hakims return to Williams unwavering devotion to Emma as well as his family it ends with the woman who started it all. Perfect! I wish there were more movies like this. ",5.0
" Most western animation for children is to put it simply really wretched. At best it's tolerable.But a shining exception would be the tale of the Avatar of all four elements and to restore the balance in the world. The first two volumes of 'Avatar The Last Airbender ' serve as a solid start to the series -- they smoothly introduce the characters and sets up some nice story arcs without skimping on development of either.South Pole Water Tribe siblings Katara and Sokka stumble across a glowing iceberg with a young Airbender boy named Aang (and his flying bison) inside. All Airbenders were killed long ago. You guessed it (and so does Katara)",5.0

" After purchasing and watching this movie I can see why there is such a cult following. The movie was obviously made with very little budget but the quality blew me away. The movie follows a town that gets taken over by vampires. They attack innocent people and drink lots of blood. The similarities to other vampire movies stops there however. The acting in this movie is non-existent but the action explods off the screen. The gore and death scenes are great and I was shocked (Thats real blood people). Chainsaw weilding maniacs and ghouls of the night.This movie took WAY too long in production but the special features and movie transfer are WELL worth the wait.Great (Dare I say 'B') vampire genre film.Keep in mind this IS very low budget-so if you're expecting 'Blade' you will be dissapointed.

" This is an excellent two disk set filled with tons of extras. The film is a gore soaked saga pitting a group of young people against an ever growing vampire hoard. Filled with tons of bloody spurting gooey deaths it should be a delight for gore-hounds. The film moves at a nice fast pace and is never boring. Where the DVD really shines is in the extras. Multiple commentary tracks are included with the cast and crew. This commentary illustrates the love these people share for the film as well as being very insightful on the makings of low budget renegade cinema. Also included is an original cut of the film that is also worth watching to see how 'Darkenss' morphed over the years into the current version. We are also given a nice set of interviews with many of the cast as they look back on their experiences making the film. All I can say is this movie is a lot of fun-check it out. ",5.0

" I usually buy the salted version of this butter since I mostly use it for spreading and for that I like the flavor of the salted version better. That being said there are a number of recipies that call for unsalted butter and then the unsalted Lurpak is as good as you will find.Note that Lurpak is cultured butter (not sweet cream butter like most American brands) and as such it has a deep and rich flavor that no simple sweet cream butter can match. Cultured butter of this kind is produced by fermenting the cream with lactic bacteria that convert sugars to lactic acid before churning the cream into butter.In my opinion the Lurpak Danish butter holds its own in comparison with far more expensive butters. I actually prefer Lurpak over brands like Echire etc. ",5.0

" The front man for bands like Not drowning waving and My friend The Chocolate Cake has released what I consider the best CD I have heard in years. There are too many great songs on this CD to name a standout track. (Not one 'skipper') Gentle piano soundscapes over a wash of atmospheric sounds and Bridie's unique vocal arrangements make this the best CD of its kind since David Sylvian's 'Secrets of the beehive' in 1987. This is a must have for anyone that enjoys fragile but moving music. It amazes me that this CD and this artist will never get the recognition in the USA he deserves. Thanks Australia! ",5.0
" The album 'Act of Free Choice' is a superbly crafted series of songs incorporating orchestral arrangements piano balladry electronica and David Bridie's own husky lyrics. The net effect is sublime with many thoughtful ruminations on traditional Australian life and also the people of Irian Jaya whose struggle for independence from Indonesia is one of Bridie's most public causes.This album is quite unlike a typical rock or pop work and it totally eschews the hackneyed and over-produced musical fare that typically dominiates our airwaves and album charts. The songs have a lyrical atmosphere that combines both melancholy and quiet joy - particular highlights for me are 'Dive' 'Kerosene' and 'Deserters'.Although this album was released around 4 years ago (in 2000) it seems to reveal more every time it is played. It gained quite an amount of radio airplay at the time of its release (largely on the independent stations) and is widely regarded in Australia as one of the best new releases of the past few years.For American and other non-Australian listeners who want to gain a sense of the best of contemporary Australian music ignore Kylie Minogue and her ilk - try this album instead. Also definitely worth a listen is Bridie's more recent release 'Hotel Radio'. - Pallando Sydney Australia ",5.0
" Australian Rock looks to be in good shape right now with the likes of David Bridie and Powderfinger flying the flag with excellent recent albums. It's evident on first listen that Bridie's 'Act of Free Choice' sounds like nothing else out there at once urgent graceful and haunting you can expect these 11 songs to take over your mind and senses for a good while to come. The sparse beats and subtle atmospherics may find an influence in Massive Attack yet Bridie goes one further marrying these tracks to lovely unfolding melodies. Nowhere is this more evident than on 'Dive' which just envelops you in it's sheer beauty 'Kerosene' too has this power. Even the more minamilist songs have a hypnotic pull with Bridie tackling social/political as well as personal themes. It's one thing to enjoy an album another to come away from it feeling transformed and somewhat beholden from the experience. It may not be widely heard ...yet but this is essential listening. ",5.0

" SOREN AABYE KIERKEGAARD (1813-1855) 'stepped' into history as the master in managing the weapon of irony. As a young student he was fascinated by SOCRATES and the German romantic thinkers and writers. This is one of the 4 most important works of him. Some Kierkegaard lovers even call it his magnus opum. In fact this rather early work (1841) is a dissertation which in particular addresses Socratic irony (and the German romantics). The irony was to him a protest against bourgeoisie and a strong weapon against the speculative philosophy from Rene DESCARTES (1596-1650) - Kierkegaard was the first person to demask the lie of Descartes i.e. his 'cogito ergo sum' 'I think therefore I am' - up until Wilhelm Friedrich HEGEL (1770-1831).

" When this album was cut in 1956 participants Kenny Burrell Pepper Adams Tommy Flanagan and Paul Chambers were all young modern jazz players just making names for themselves on the scene; it wouldn't be long before all were considered stars. All four of them were from Detroit - thus the title(only house drummer Kenny Clarke didn't qualify in this regard). It's a very relaxed date with just about all the tunes assuming a medium groove. John Lewis's attractive AFTERNOON IN PARIS gets an excellent treatment with Flanagan's piano solo being especially fine. Tommy is also brilliant on Kenny's original blues TOM'S THUMB a tune that reverses the order of things a bit by starting out with Burrell and baritone saxist Pepper Adams exchanging 4s at the beginning rather than at the end of the tune. YOUR HOST another Burrell original is perhaps the most relaxed tune on the date with everyone producing quiet yet swinging jazz; Kenny Clarke's brushwork is particularly delicate and delightful. This is a solid mainstream-modern jazz album from the mid-50s - definitely worth looking into. ",5.0

" Listen up folks if you want to add to your music library. I know a little bit about good music but of course that's just my opinion.If any of you our there are fans of classic 70's kind of music this is a CD that is obscure but you shouldn't pass up. I looked for this album for nearly 10 years and finally found it about a year ago. It is now safely tucked away in my safety deposit box. That's how good it is to me.If you like artists like Gino Vanelli or Steely Dan you need to check this out. Roger has an absolutely stellar voice and the musicianship (sp?) on this CD are simply fantastic. These guys who the heck ever they are are fantastic musicians.My favorite tune is well you don't really care about that but trust me please try this album you won't be disappointed.Great voice fantastic lyrics touching melodies. I can't say enough good things about this album that I thought was lost to me forever. I wish he were still recording!A '10' (well '5' to Amazon) if ever there was one. ",5.0
" There is no doubt that Anthony Callea has one of the best voices of all time. This DVD was recorded after his first album was released. It has a great variety of songs including his big hits like 'The Prayer' 'Per Sempre' 'Bridge over Troubled Water' and 'Rain.' I think my favorite might be 'Wanna Be the One' which is infectious and upbeat.Though this wouldn't play on my old DVD player I had no problem playing it on my computer. Besides the concert there are five videos a making of and a behind the scenes. All in all it's one of my favorite concert DVDs ever. Now I hope my dream comes true and he duets with Leona Lewis someday. ",5.0
" This may be a 'crib' but it is possible to learn a great deal from it. It is not only about the two plays but also contains a short biography of Sartre and summaries and analyses of his major works the novel 'Nausea' and his major philosophical work 'Being and Nothingness'.It also contains a summary of the essay on 'Existensialism' one of his most influential works.It does not however as it was published in 1983 contain the latest revelations about Sartre's life and work. At the time it was written my sense is Sartre's reputation was more unimpeached than it is today. This guide stresses how much of a 'humanist' Sartre was  and how he always focused on the human situation and how deeply his writing is involved in the social problems of mankind.But Sartre's gung- ho Communist Anarchism is seen by many today as less than commendable. And his personal life shown to be far more contemptible and exploitative than was previously thought.In any case this work which rightly see Sartre more as writer than philosopher provides an excellent introduction to his overall accomplishment.

I worshiped at Greg's church years ago and have kept up with him over the years and marvel at the anointed power of his messages. When I heard this story for the first time I had no idea his life had been so difficult growing up. To see what the Lord did for this broken lost little boy is a magnificent testimony to His colossal love for us. Greg has been tested on the anvil of adversity and his story has profoundly affected my life and faith. As powerful as his ministry was before it is even more so now.

" This drawing textbook is a great deal. It has over 200 art lessons and meets the high school fine arts requirement. For the price you can't get a better deal. ",5.0
" I love to draw and have done so most of my life and yet have known so many who say 'I can't even draw a straight line'. I have found this book to be a great and simple manual to teach out of. I have personally known both adults and children who found the artist within from using the Drawing Textbook. This book gave me a way to explain some concepts simply that I didn't have the words for. To be able to do but not be able to understand HOW has been the chasm around drawing101. This book is your bridge over that chasm. It is great to teach out of but I doubt a child would want to pick up this book on his or her own to learn out of that isn't talented to begin with. The feel of it seems more mature than that.For those who can draw well this book was not made for you. It was made for beginners and those who look at drawing as something 'talented' people do. It is made for teachers like me who need words to describe things they know how to do. If you fall into one of those categories I really do not think you'll be disappointed. ",5.0

This course is part of our basic curriculum. ",5.0
" The author argues that everyone can learn to draw in a way that enables him to express his ideas in pictures just as he can learn to express ideas in words through writing. It takes no special talent and only a very tiny minority will be unable to acquire this skill.Conventional art education says that art is used solely to 'express yourself' without ever learning the basis of art - drawing. This is as silly (and frustrating and ultimately discouraging) as giving a child a violin and telling him to express himself through music. We can be taught the fundamentals of drawing just as we can be taught the fundamentals of music and while most of us will never achieve mastery or beauty we can at least achieve proficiency and have a new lifelong skill. This simple inexpensive text delivers on its promises!My 5th grade daughter and I have used this text and now can communicate readily via pictures for art math engineering (me) structural design etc. I've used these skills to renovate my master bathroom!

" David Remnick's 'King of the World' is one of my favorite books and it encouraged me to take on this meaty Pulitzer Prize winner. Remnick was on the ground as The Washington Post's Moscow bureau chief and in this work he strings together all of his exhaustive reporting for a compelling account of the collapse of the Soviet Empire.If you're running a mock U.N. at your school I'd rate 'Lenin's Tomb' as mandatory reading. ",5.0
" Reading David Remnick's unmatched work chronicalling the demise of the USSR may well have been responsible for my decision to major in Soviet History. As a professional student of the Soviet Union if I could recommend only one book on the USSR of the dozens that I have now read this would easily be me choice. It is as informative for the novice as it is challenging for the expert. If you have even the slightest interest in the demise of a world superpower and the twentieth century's most influential - and murderous - ideology you simply must read this book. ",5.0
" Despite the book's Pulitzer Prize I'm a little ambivalent about saying this in one of the best books I have read. For sure some of the best parts are that Remnick seemingly has open access to all the major Soviet political players while he was there. And he doesn't even brag about it. The titans of Soviet politics seem to be open to all who want to speak with them though Remnick's day job as the Moscow correspondent for the Washington Post certainly helped...a large part of his life in Russia then that he totally did not to write about.It's fun to follow him track down figures and weasel his way to get access to whoever he wants to talk with. He clearly is excited to be there during the transition and is personally invested in the story as he speaks Russian and both his parents and his parents-in-laws have Russian ancestry. On the other hand the book is a rag tag contemporaneous collection of personal reporting and interests lacking to some degree the broad overview that only comes with the passage of time.Doubtlessly you get the feeling of what it was like living in the Soviet Union during the Gorbachev years and the transition to Yeltsin and the end of the Communist Party....with the addition of having Remnick magically inserting himself in front of whoever he wants to talk with to fill you in on the inside story.Enjoy it.

Because it is agreatly written story about the most important event in thiscentury ",5.0
" Remnick writes eloquently and grippingly. He amazes the reader with one heartbreaking vignette after another. It seems amazing that though while only spending a few years in Russia he seemingly met everybody who was anybody and traveled to the remotest parts of the dying empire.Remnick does not try hard unfortunately to maintain objectivity. He deifies much of the intellectual dissident movement even repeatedly callling Andrei Sakharov a 'saint.' Remnick turns Gorbachev into nothing more than a well-meaning Pandora responsible for and unable to control the breakup of the Soviet Union.Remnick does show what I believe to be responsible for the breakup of the USSR- namely the rot corruption and inefficiency endemic in the Soviet system- but he seemingly relegates it to symptomatic and not primary status. The empire would have inevitably broken up with or without Perestroika and Glasnost. The book should rank despite its flaws among the best books of contemporary history ever written-doing for Russia what Democracy in America did for the US. ",5.0
" Remnick masterfully kills the Republican/Conservative myth that Ronald Reagan 'a triumph of the embalmer's art' in Gore Vidal's words led the demise of the Soviet communist empire through buying ever too many useless weapons. By showing the implosion of a very cruel very corrupt poorly managed state there can no longer be doubt about the reason for the demise of Lenin's dream. It's interesting to note that since capitalistic democracy has been introduced in Russia living standards have actually dropped (in large part because of corruption and cronyism). I definitely want to read Remnick's follow-up Resurrection to learn more about this. ",5.0
" David Remnick reported on site for the WASHINGTON POST during the Soviet Union's last days. He interviewed many persons from society's bottom to society's top from homeless derelict to Mikhail Gorbachev. That and his readable prose help explain how he won the Pulitzer. Of course it also helped that he was against totalitarianism and for humanity.When I read history I prefer a firm grip on the date. Overall this story does flow in chronological order from 1988 to 1992 or to 1994 if you get the most recent edition with its afterword. But the story jumps backward occasionally when Remnick tells the history of a character and at other moments I was vague on the date. I think chapters should have been subheaded with dates and more spots within chapters should have stated the date.Nevertheless do not let my preceding quibble deter you. I think this book is already something of a classic and I'll be darned if I'm going to give it anything less than five stars. Does another book do as well as what this book does which is put you into the scene of the collapse of the vast Soviet empire?I would have advised Mr. Remnick to include a double-paged map of the U.S.S.R. and a glossary of names events and institutions. We do get source notes bibliography index a list of interviews and twenty-two pages of relevant photos.The Vintage trade-paperback edition is over five hundred pages in small font. So be ready for something to settle back with. It will be worth a portion of the limited time you have in life. The story and the people are phenomenal and they will expand your existential horizon.

" A stupendous chronicling of history in the making! We are presented with several differing viewpoints on the collapse of the Soviet regime and its splintering in these truly tumultuous years. As the author points out whereas other empires like England took decades to recede and change - this took place within a few years. Within days sometimes overwhelming transitions took place.The efficacy of this book is the internal focus on the people in the country itself; there is none of this hyperbole on how Ronald Reagan solely dismantled the evil empire! The book is about the Soviet Union - there is little on the break-away of the Eastern Bloc countries like Poland or East Germany. Mr. Remnick presents us with a wide array of people across this vast land - from various dissidents to various neo-Stalinists. We experience their anguish as the grim and brutal history of their country becomes revealed as once secret archives are exposed.This book is well-written engaging and sprinkled with some wry humour. If you are interested in this epoch it is a truly marvellous and first-hand account. ",5.0
" The book is a compilation of short stories (each chapter a dozen pages or so) about the author's first-hand experiences in the Gorbachev's Soviet Union. From Baltic to Sakhalin and from coal miners to Gorbachev himself from Stalin to Yeltsin and from Solzhenitsyn to Sakharov the book paints the picture of the monolith's fall. This colorful collage describing the critical period in Russian history combined with keen commentary creates for the reader the distinct flavor of the time.For Russia it was the age of confusion and disillusionment. Gorbachev's half-hearted reforms (the interest in truth ended where the Party interests were concerned the pursuit of democracy gave way to the pursuit of the runaway republics etc.) were matched by the half-hearted '91 coup (no real plan no propaganda with the military Lenin wouldn't have approved).For generations Russian people did not know much of the sad history of their country and less still about the life in the West. The blissful ignorance was one thing that helped them in their miserable existence. Their various degrees of belief in the grand ideals were the other. With glasnost Gorbachev aimed at opening the gates of truth while preserving the faith. In all honesty it was impossible",5.0
" Remnick's frank insightful analysis of the Soviet Union's final days filled me with inspiration and sadness. I'm inspired by the inhuman perseverance of the Russian and Soviet bloc people and saddened by the intense and lethal persecution of millions at the hands of their so-called leaders. Remnick shows a society led by decades of fear - citizens who feared persecution and leaders who feared the loss of power. The author flows easily from dissecting the Communist party and power brokers of Soviet society to eating cabbage with Siberian miners who don't expect to live past 35 to intense discussions with the Russian intelligentsia who fought the system quietly and desperately. It is a long book and at times I found myself needing a Russian history reference guide. But Remnick is not writing a history filled with facts and statistics. It is all about the people. Lenin's Tomb should be read by any journalist who feels the urge to go beyond 8 graphs. Truly wonderful. ",5.0
" It's hard to imagine there was any dissention from the Pulitzer committee over 'Lenin's Tomb'. This book excellently combines top-notch journalism and fine precise descriptive writing for an increbidly enjoyable and informative read. Considering how most such 'good for you' books are long slogs about as exciting as bran 'Lenin's Tomb' was a surprising pleasure.I came to this book with minimal knowledge of Russia in general let alone the Soviet transition and disliking what I had encountered of Russia's culture and people. 'Lenin's Tomb' manages to explain the basics to ignorant laypeople like myself without condescending or dragging through too much history. What you need to understand what was happening Remnick provides no more and no less.'Lenin's Tomb' proved an eye opener about the Soviet experience but it also reflects on the larger ramifications of Communist autocracy. So many of the explorations of the Soviet erosion of society and culture gave me a sense of Deja Vu compared with China only China has perhaps been less scathed by the shorter span of its bureaucratic red terror. Also while 'Lenin's Tomb' did not make me like Russia or Russians any more it did present the context of how and why people can be a certain way so that I now hold it against them less.'Lenin's Tomb' is almost novelesque in its readability a page-turner and easily beach or plane fare. I doff my hat to Remnick's ability to carve dense political stuff into an involving compelling narrative. Perhaps Russia scholars would find points to criticize but from a journalistic perspective 'Lenin's Tomb' is the book all of us wish we could write. ",5.0
" Mr. Remnick has given us a masterwork. He seamlessly meshes intimate portraits of Soviet citizens within the larger landscape of the last days of the Soviet Empire. He has a rare ability to blend the micro and the macro in a soul-stirring narrative. This is a profound work that is filled with compelling stories. Lenin's Tomb is so superb that even those who avoid 'history books' will relish it. Could not more highly recommend this book. The scads of glowing reviews below are all well deserved. ",5.0
" In the Pulizer-Prize winner Lenin's Tomb David Remnick offers the reader a trip through history that is at once frightening and enthralling. Beginning with the horrors orchestrated by Lenin and continuing through the rise of Yeltsin to power Remnick intertwines political and social history with first-hand accounts which he gathered during his time in Russia during the 80s. The result is a work of unparalleled genius taking hard facts and presenting them in a personal way that makes the reader feel as if he is actually experiencing them. The end result is a chilling dose of reality for those who have idealistic notions of the world in which we live. I highly recommend this work in which Remnick portrays the brutal realities of socialist life as well as the inevitable downfall of such a system. ",5.0
" Now that we are a decade removed from the fall of the Soviet Empire it is a wonderful to look back and read a fabulous primary source about the events. Remnick the Moscow correspondant for The Washington Post during the late 80's and early 90's (and since the editor of the New Yorker which was a well deserved honor for a fabulous journalist if I may say so myself) was right on the scene when the incredible collapse of Communism took place. He interviewed hundreds if not thousands of people who had lived through the Soviet regime and who played some role regarldless of how small and seemingly insignificant in the transformation of the nation and this research paid huge dividends. He combines all these personal stories into one great book that explains and analyzes why and how this happened. It is very well written and while being comprehensive remains comprehensible. It is a wonderful book and anyone who is interested in Russia (or would like to become so) likes history in general or enjoys good semi-academic writing this book is for you. ",5.0
" Lenin's Tomb is an autopsy of sorts performed by one present during the last death throes of the Soviet Union.

" Lenin's Tomb by David Remnick chronicles the point at which the rot at the center of the Soviet system became more powerful than the Communist Party's iron fist. Remnick is a storyteller telling the story of a riveting period in history. As he writes 'To live anywhere between Bonn and Moscow in 1989 was to be witness to a year-long polical fantasy. You had the feeling you could run into history on the way to the bank or the seashore.' Lucky for us Remnick spent 1989 (as well as the years before and after) in Moscow. ",5.0

" David Remnick has given us two things",5.0
" Remnick's book is easily the most graphic and accurate account in English of the Gorbachev years between 1985 and 1991. It is unlikely to be surpassed. I judge his accuracy from his account of the August 1991 putsch which is excellent given the information that was available. As the renegade agent that triggered the June 'constitutional coup' KGB Chief Kryuchkov's August 6th decision to draft coup documents AND the August 14th decision to again start drafting the documents I have referred to Remnick in my research on the coup and the events that lead up to it. Suffice it to say that Kryuchkov's final decision on August 14th was triggered by the Bulgarian President who fired the two KGB appointees at the head of his intelligence service at my instigation. I had disclosed to him some intelligence secrets that compromised both the KGB and the British MI6 and proved that his intelligence chiefs were communist puppets which was hardly surprising since Presidents Bush and Gorbachev had agreed to leave Bulgaria in the Soviet sphere of interest at Malta in June 1989. Like a lot of people in Bulgaria I disagreed with that decision. One of the best ways of judging the accuracy of a book like Remnick's is to see how the information given in the book dovetails with the secret stuff and his book does so nicely. ",5.0
" A great fresco of the dramatic death of the communist URSS. The author lived as a correspondant in moscow for many years during the final years of the cold war and describes the tragic living conditions of the common people the corrupt style of living of the burocrats the disgusting privileges of the elites. An enclosed empire founded on corruption lies violence and misery where the dream of a better life for the masses promised by the communist leaders in the decades only became a rotten shell of deception and misery. The author interviewed hundreds of people of any social class from the miners in the urals to Mr. Gorbachev from Yeltsin to the moscow houseviwes including scientists artists poets smart people confined to the edges of the empire because of their open mindedness and acumen. This book is another important tragic witness of a wrecked dream a tale told by hundreds of different voices that all tell thesame story of treachery and indecency corruption and stupidity. A great history book that I highly recommend and that clearly helps us to understand why now Urss is governed like an authocracy by an ex kgb officer. Great book. ",5.0
" This book is a fascinating exploration of the last days of the Soviet Union providing a background of the broad mix of events and people involved both before during and after the Gorbachev era.

The watershed approach addresses environmental issues within natural hydrologically defined geographic areas taking into consideration both surface and ground water flow. Important within the watershed approach is the cumulative impact of a wide variety of human activities and the prioritization of critical issues within a given watershed. Dr. Reimold points to work in the Chesapeake Bay and the Florida Everglades as two good examples of decisions being made and focused integrated actions being taken on a 'whole drainage system' basis rather than by controlling point sources of pollution only. Water Management spans case studies in the U.S. France the Nile River basin the Pacific rim and former Soviet Union. The book contains a foreword by Dr. Eugene P. Odum. Dr. Odum professor emeritus at the University of Georgia is a recipient of the Crafoord Prize-an equivalent of the Nobel Prize-for excellence in ecology from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. It is well-annotated subject-indexed and authenticated quantitatively. Robert S. Frey M.A. Editor/Publisher BRIDGES",5.0

" I loved this book- as a neopagan it gave me insight into how much of Wicca and in turn neopaganism developed. I realize it does only focus on Wicca itself and that there were several other movements contributing to the rise of Neopaganism but the book's title states the topic so no reader should be expecting much else! On the flip side because they helped contribute Freemasons Aleister Crowley and others are covered even though they themselves were not Wiccan. Overall excellent book well-written and a must-read for any and all people even interested in Neopaganism Wicca or modern witchcraft! ",5.0

" I love the realistic damage and the crazy ways you can race in this game. The only downside is it's difficult to race multiple opponents without getting knocked off the track as is most race games where the AI is pretty aggressive.

I've even run over my driver with my own car which I've never done in any racing game before. ",5.0

You forget you have anything on your feet. They have a very cushiony sole which feels delicious to walk on - kind of airy. I'm going on a trip in October and I'm definitely taking them even though the cooler weather is here. The jewelry in the design held up beautifully - nothing fell out or came apart or needed fixing. I ordered them in a size 11 so that's a lot of shoe. The straps across the top are secured toward the back of the shoe which all but completely removes that flip flop sound. They stay on the feet are quiet and are good even in the rain because of the non-skid sole. This has been my favorite thong ever and I will definitely be ordering more from White Mtn. and Amazon!

" I love this thermometer. Don't get me wrong it is definitely an expensive purchase. However the money was well spent. My husband and I went through a considerable amount of trouble in regards to our children and trying to determine if they were truly having fevers. For a period of about 6 months our kids were having fevers ranging from a low grade to a true textbook definition of having a fever. Well we were under the impression that they were. We have made several trips to the doctor's office even switching pediatricians a few times in order to try to figure out what was going on. We were using an Exergen thermometer (which our doctor's office used)that continuously showed higher temperatures. Now I'm not knocking the thermometer in fact it's helped us during other incidents of true fevers. But based on what our pediatricians kept saying the only way to get an accurate temperature reading is with a rectal temp. Now the basic rectal thermometers that can be purchased at local pharmacies/walmart/target/etc never work for us. This Welch Allyn thermometer is accurate and considerable fast considering how long it takes to get rectal temps. So for parents who have been having difficulty finding an accurate reading of your child's temperature save yourself the stress and purchase something that will definitely match up to your standards. It's expensive but will save you money in the long run. ",5.0
" Item is exactly what I wanted and expected. I decided after purchasing several other Probe Ear and Temple Thermometers and them not work properly as well as not being accurate it was time to spend the money and use exactly what they use at the Dr.'s office.

" My health condition requires frequent monitoring of my temperature. The inexpensive thermometers were inconsistent and replacement batteries were hard to find. The Sure Temp Plus 690 costs more but is very accurate easy to use and AA batteries can be purchased anywhere. I feel confident in the readings. A back lit display would be nice but is not essential. It probably would run down the batteries faster. I would recommend the item to anyone needing fast and accurate temp readings. ",5.0

" We were left with flexible spending money at the end of the year and thus decided to make the plunge and purchase this. This thermometer is expensive but worth it.

I'm very satisfied with it so far. ",5.0
" Very sturdy. Holds up well and performs accurately for long periods even in the context of high humidity and difficult conditions in a developing world hospital. ",5.0
" I got one of these for our office. This model is a big step up from the previous model (679) that it replaced. The 679 has only 1 button from which to access all functions. The 690 has 3 buttons so you can quickly access the function that you want. It appears to be durable & accurate. Highly recommended. ",5.0
" I love having this thermometer. We have three kids and one is an infant.I got rid of my pile of cheap thermometers! I don't have to second guess the reading like I did with the cheap ones. If you have an infant you will need a rectal probe. I ended up buying that and switch them out depending on which kid we need to check. It's easy to switch out and I recommend spending the money to have that peace of mind. ",5.0

I consulted with a health practitioner who recommended the Welch Allyn Suretemp Plus 690. It works. It gives consistent temperature readings.

We just replaced the well and probe a few months ago. The casing finally cracked after all of this time. We have only had to change the batteries twice too. It is still working perfectly and we would recommend this thermometer to anyone who really needs to take temperatures often. It is so reliable. This one gets 5 stars!!!!! ",5.0
" This thermometer is great. We went through a number of less-expensive thermometers before finally finding this one. As a parent of a young child it's really important to be able to quickly and accurately take a temperature. After an unexpected hospital stay we noticed the really awesome thermometers used by the hospital staff. While this model is not quite the one from the hospital it is the exact model used by our pediatrician. We can always count on it to be fast and accurate!If you have any money left over in your annual healthcare savings account I recommend spending the money on one of these! ",5.0
" My wife has some health issues and needs to monitor her temperature regularly. We have gone through all of the cheap digital thermometers we could find I finally got sick of having the variance in readings(some were off by as much as .5 degrees!) I decided to find the best one I could get. this is it. the same one found in hospitals and doctor's offices the 690 is accurate fast and reliable. It also has a history which makes reporting to your doctor if you need to easy to do. if you only need to take your temp once in a while don't bother with this but if you even have to take it weekly I would say this is the only one to consider. make sure you get extra probe covers and replace the battery regularly but otherwise using the model could not be faster or easier.

" In rich and poetic prose Kincaid powerfully describes the life story of Xuela a woman with an alienated and barren soul who cannot love and does not want to be loved yet surprisingly is very sensual. Kincaid points to the role of motherly love and the bond to the homeland in forming the individual personality and consequently one's flow of life.My quote",5.0
" I think more readers should read this in context of Jamaica Kincaid's own personal life especially regarding her torn relationship with her mother. It would then become extremely touching as Kincaid really writes this to save her own living. While other reviewers have found this book to be harsh or dirty in some sense we should gain the sense that this narrator is really at a loss for love that there is so little to love but was able to find love in herself. ",5.0
" If you understand the culture of the Caribbean then you will certainly understand and enjoy this book. As I read it I remembered all the intresting characters from my childhood that resembled the characters in The Autobiography of My Mother. Jamica Kincaid's style is so richly descriptive it takes you 'home' again. Xuela is a very strong female character and although fate has made many of her choices for her she ultimately takes control of her own destiny. A very good read as are all her other works. ",5.0
" Autobiography of My Mother is a powerful mesmerizing and other-worldy tale of Xuela a woman of Dominica West Indies who is a worthy subject for Kincaid's musical cadences and rapturous prose. Boy can this woman write - and she infuses all her prose with the lilting voices of her compatriots. There's no way to read her work aloud without finding yourself lapsing into the patois sing-songy style of speech that comes thru so clearly in her writing. This book is a painful tale the recounting of a difficult life without much love shown to the girl as she grows from motherless infant to strong and bitter young woman who aborts her pregnancy and remains defiant the rest of her life. Raised motherless herself she determines never to mother others. Taken on a metaphorical level the woman's story could be the story of Dominica torn by suffering racism power and the unbreakable bonds that bind them together.Powerful writing on so so many levels. ",5.0
" Although her story may not leave one with a warm feeling for Dominica just reading this book made me ache for the places in her story and I see every inch of the road the mountain the sea like it was in front me. She weaves it all together into sad life and yet how can you not long to see Giraudel and Mahaut Trois Piton and all deep green of that mystical place. I read it over and over and over. ",5.0
" Jamaica Kincaid's most recent book The Autobiography of My Mother is a poetically rendered account of a woman's journey through loss longing hope and strength. Kincaid's writing here is imagistic and human so that the reader can enter the character's life. The work questions our distinctions between poetry and prose fiction and autobiography the personal and the political. This book is a sensual and intellectual pleasure ",5.0
" Wonderful book! This book synthesizes the experiences of a young woman growing up on a Carribean Island. It provides a point of view into a world few people experience or understand",5.0
" This amazing novel succeeds at its ambitious and worthy goal which in my view is to show with precision - intellectual emotional visual auditory olfactory - the sinister mechanism and the devastating results of maternal abandonment. Kincaid's narrator suffers a grievous loss and the circumstances of her life reinforce and magnify that loss. No one has ever protected her and she hangs onto life by a thread. Though amidst 'family' she is truly alone in the world. Franz Kafka wrote that one should only read novels that hurt because those are the works that raise consciousness. This straightforward and skillful novel is replete with imagery of anger sadness and layers of detail that provoke utter despair in the reader - and that's just Kincaid's point. Kafka would have approved of this gripping story. ",5.0
" I think this is the general consensus from the reviews gathered here but I will add my voice to the chorus so to speak. This book is haunting. This is not one of those books that you forget about as soon as you've finished reading the last page. I've personally never been to the Caribbean and I do not think I will ever be able to personally visit Rousseau for instance but Kincaid's literary ability to make the descriptions jump off the page is something to be admired. there is a caveat to all of this of course. This book is not for the faint of heart. There are portions of this novel that are quite graphic and that is putting it lightly. That is not to say that it distracts from the work itself merely that it is there and certain sensitive readers may take affront to it. This is a rich text that can withstand multiple readings because you find something new every time. I came to this novel after reading. In a previous work ' A Small Place' and gratefully on my part the author was redeemed in my esteem. Not that I'm someone of any great import but I had completely sworn off the author as someone I could never enjoy. this book is really hard to describe beyond the utter basics to someone who has never read it. in order to do so I would need to commit a great disservice to the book and the author. There are elements of biography and autobiography as well as magic realism and what could possibly be construed as a cultural critique of the West. It is not necessary to see each and every one of these threads to enjoy the book I merely use this as a way to comment that the author certainly has an intellectual project in mind.of course this review is not an introduction to English. sufficed to say this book is worth your time.

" Those familiar with the dearly departed Miracle Legion (poster boys for the 'Should Have Been A Household Name Foundation') and the under-rated Upstate New York Americana-rockers Subduing Mara will find this little release to be a pleasant surprise. Sparse intimate and demo-ish (in the best of all possible ways) Mara frontman Peter Hutchison and the Legion's legendary Mr. Ray have combined efforts to create a casual and intimate folk-rock gem. Difficult to catagorize this short-but-sweet offering is reminiscent of everything from David Gray to Supertramp to 'Me & Mr. Ray' era Miracle Legion. Although the disc credits Hutchison with the songwriting Mr. Ray's Legion-flavored 6-string sonic stamp is readily apparent throughout. Despite the fact that it's a far from perfect disc ('Promise' for instance sounds like an exercise in 'we better put a pop song somewhere on this thing') 'exquisite corpse' has a distinctly unique character and is both beatific and quirky in turn. Unfortunately for Lucas Shine this record defies being shoved into any convenient little boxes for the sake of marketing. Fortunately for the rest of us however there are people still out there making this kind of music... hopefully we'll hear more from these folks down the line. ",5.0
" This disc contains Ornette Coleman's pioneering 37-minute 'Free Jazz' PLUS 40 minutes of shorter pieces recorded in the same year. So for a little less money than the American release of 'Free Jazz' you get about twice as much music and the title track is the final piece a fitting climax to a great set of music. That said the jazz on this disc may be more challenging than some listeners would like but among the extended collective improvisations of the sixties besides being the first this one is more immediately accessible because it SWINGS and it COOKS! And you can tell the musicians are actively listening to each other and responding to each other's work not just showing off or venting their emotions. So in a nutshell 'Free Jazz' is less cosmic than Sun Ra's 'Magic City' less cerebral than Cecil Taylor and less primal than Coltrane's 'Ascension' but probably more likely to hook you into an intensely brilliant musical world.

" This book is a paradox. It is written in a casual conversational style yet it contains very scholarly information. Ostensibly aimed at a young adult or even younger audience it appeals just as well to adults. The main text runs about 105 pages with an appendix. It gives detailed information on the arms armor and fighting style of the Germanic peoples that overran the Roman empire in Western Europe from around 400-800 A.D. It is the little details that really appealed to me such as how the sword hilts were constructed different makers marks on blades and centers of manufacture. The excellent illustrations by the author compliment the text nicely as well. The author ended this study around 800 A.D. because that is when new metalworking technology changed the types of swords being made thus beginning a new era in weaponry and swords in particular. I will definitely be reading more books by this author. ",5.0

" I started taking Vitex after reading about it on many fertility sites. My husband and I have been trying to conceive for over 6 months and are trying everything to make it happen before he deploys. I have always had irregular periods- even my first one was. I had been on birth control mainly to regulate my periods before meeting my husband and then afterwards to prevent pregnancy. I was having two periods a month or one every 45 days- just all over the map. Since coming off of birth control 7 months ago my cycles would vary in length between 25 and 35 days. It was driving me crazy having to wonder for weeks at a time if I was just 'late' again or if I was pregnant. Then when the cycles were shorter my luetal phase was not long enough to carry out implantation thsu preventing pregnancy. So I ordered Vitex. I have had a regular 27 day cycle for four months now. I can even pinpoint the exact day I will start my period which has NEVER happened. I will be taking this from now on instead of birth control (after a pregnancy- hopefully!) to regulate my cycles. I highly reccomend it. ",5.0
" I have been reading about vitex for a year or so. I tried using another brand of vitex and I would feel very weird (dizzy light-headed super heavy flow)...I guess it was because the levels of vitex varied with each capsule....so I was never able to get the correct dosage. So after reading the reviews for the Solaray Vitex I decided to give it one more shot. I highly recommend THIS brand of Vitex because the ingredients are standardized...meaning you are guaranteed get the same potency with every capsule.I have been seeing my doctor for two years now to correct my infertility problems. He told me that I was not able to ovulate on my own. I would have to take drugs. I wanted to try a more natural way first. Last month I wasn't taking vitex....and I did not ovulate. This month i am pleased to say that I have a positive on my ovulation stick! I was so happy that I took a picture of it to show my doctor!! It is definitely working for me.

On a side note about two years ago I bought some Vitex for PMS and it didn't seem to work. Later I found out from reading that it's the Vitex Extract that is supposed to be more effective for these feminine problems and what I had purchased before was just Vitex Fruit. I'm not sure whether or not the Solaray Vitex Extract I'm taking now is helping my PMS crabbiness but I think it is helping with my bloating. ",5.0

" I spent a lot of time researching natural remedies to help with fertility. My husband and I had been trying for 2 years and no success. I am 36 years old with no children and it started getting frustrating. I had 100% normal periods 28 days exactly every month. I had read some reviews that said do not take Vitex if you have normal periods. I also get migraines. BAD migraines usually the exact day before my period.Because of this economy my husband moved out of state to look for work and so we have been seperated for the past 9 months. We timed out visits with eachother around ovulation. Still no luck. In May 2010 I started taking vitex. My first period happened as normal as usual but this time no migraine! In July I planned a visit up north to visit my husband. Upon returning to Florida I discovered I was pregnant! This after 2 months of taking Vitex!SO I am a believer in this! I'm sure there may have been other factors involved the food is much fresher and healthier up north and we were just haning out having a good time no stress. If nothing else if you get hormone related migraines I would try Vitex. I have had migraines for many years so bad I have been in the hospital for them and I have a high pain threshold! Still have a long way to go and I am considered 'high risk' because of my age but an thrilled with Vitex! Highly recommended even with regular periods. ",5.0
" This works! It is AMAZING! It helps your body to produce progesterone. You don't need to take progesterone if you take this. It made a huge difference with my emotional symptoms before my period. I am like a new person! And it helped with spotting that I was having from not having enough progesterone. I didn't have to take the risky progesterone my doctor wanted me to take- I cured myself with this. Make sure that you take the Vitex that is the extract with .5% Agnuside (this one). Don't take the one that is just Chaste Tree fruit. It does nothing and it's a shame that they make it because people might try it and think that Vitex doesn't work. I want every woman who is suffering needlessly to discover Vitex because it helped me SO much! ",5.0

" I have always had a normal menstral cycle until about a year ago when I stopped getting my period.

I read in a book that Chaste Berry Extract could make that possible. It said it could take a few months but I thought I would give it a try. I have been taking it (one pill a day) for months now and for the first few months the change was minimal but I could tell a little bit of a difference. Now it seems to be working it is a lot more regulated than it was. I've only had to take the Provera one time during the first few months of taking this extract. Hopefully soon I won't need the Provera at all! I will continue to take this product for a long while. If you are having the same problem as me I STRONGLY recommend this!

" This is the most awesome product ever! I used to have regular periods till I hit my late 20's then my system started going crazy. I'd miss a period then get one the following month. Then I went for 3 months without...hence a trip to the dr and left with a prescription for Provera. I started researching Provera and only found bad stuff about it being synthetic... my search lead me to Vitex and since its natural I thought it's worth a try. I took one pill a day and the following month my period was right on schedule...and each month since!! I think it works wonderfully.Before writing this review I read the others and noticed one lady writing about the decreased migraines. I used to suffer from migraines at least once a week and they were bad & horrible. Bad enough to make a trip to the ER sometimes as I was sure something much more was wrong...they were that intense! I noticed in the last past few months that I've had less migraines and they were less intense some that I could skip taking a pill. Upon reading the other ladies reviews I'm now confident it was Vitex regularing out the hormones that were causing the migraines. I too found that I'm less irritable and moody.I want to call Vitex the magic 'lady fix'. ",5.0
" When I found this product for my daughter she was 20 years old and just diagnosed with PCOS. She had moderate beard growth very overweight and extremely painful periods. After having a CAT scan done that diagnosed PCOS (they found cysts on her ovaries) and a blood test that showed an extremely high testosterone level (way above the normal range) I was quite alarmed when the doctor told us that he wanted to put her on Yaz birth control pills and spironolactone a potassium-sparing diuretic (it acts as an anti-androgen but then you have to monitor your potassium intake). I didn't want my daughter on these powerful drugs that both can have dangerous side effects (strokes for Yaz cancer for spironolactone). So I decided to research a natural supplement that she could try first before resorting to the prescription medications. I found Vitex Chaste Berry Extract and I started giving my daughter two capsules per day. There have been no side effects from taking this product. My daughter went back to the endocrinologist 6 months later for another blood test. I admitted to the doctor that my daughter had not taken the meds he had prescribed - that we had tried her on Vitex for the past 6 months. I promised him that if the blood test showed no improvement in her testosterone level we would start her on the meds. Lo and behold when the results of the blood test came back my daughter's testosterone level was reduced to one-half of the previous level--and it is back in the middle of the normal range!! I was thrilled! This is a great product and I highly recommend it for lowering testosterone levels in a female. ",5.0

" From the charming opening sequence of memories from Rosemary and L. Sprague de Camp to the interesting list of Heinlein's 'Unwritten Works' this volume provides a fascinating insider's look at Robert Heinlein's life and work.It purports to cover every one of Heinlein's published works ... short stories novellas and novels all ... and I believe that claim. If it is missing anything I would be unable to name it. The book generally assumes that the reader is a Heinlein fan and has read all or most of his work. You won't find much in the way of plot summaries here. What you will find is information about various drafts of novels where information is available and for these it is interesting to see how an original concept was molded into published form.There are some notes and tidbits about every work often including information about Heinlein's inspiration for the work as a whole or for elements used here and there in the story. Other pieces of trivia are liberally mixed in.Oddly the author makes a number of mistakes when trying to enumerate various plot ideas. For example when listing Heinlein works which use time travel as a device he forgets 'Farnham's Freehold'. In listing books that use the surface of Venus as a location he forgets 'Space Cadets.' However I can forgive these oversights. If nothing else it gives the reader a chance to 'participate' by knowing that you remember something about Heinlein's work that this researcher overlooked or forgot. ;-)If you haven't read at least most of Heinlein's novels and many of his short works then this book probably isn't for you. You'd be completely lost in not knowing the context of the discussion for most of the works. Without an abiding love of Heinlein's fiction much of this could be deadly dry.For someone like me who literally grew up reading Heinlein (I read 'The Star Beast' during the first month of 4th grade when I was nine years old and I'm pretty sure that was the first sci-fi I'd ever read) this book is a treasure and I wish I had happened across it long ago. I don't agree with every conclusion drawn by the author but there are many things about Heinlein's writing that even two die hard fans will disagree about.If you haven't read a lot of Heinlein the information in this book is not of the type to often inform you or inspire you to read particular Heinlein works. For folks like me who have devoured his every word often many times each page contains interesting information.Highly recommended for every Heinlein fan. ",5.0

Instead of a dramatic presentation it's a deep exploration of choices and alternatives and risks that such a mission would face.

" The amazon.com reviewer hits it right on the nose regarding this set. Stravinsky was not a conductor at the start of his career but began to conduct his own works in public in the 1920s when he was in his mid-forties doubtless in part because he needed the income. Some of his earliest recordings are not entirely successful (at least in my opinion) but by the time he made the ones in this set in the early 1950s he was truly expert in getting his players to produce what he had in mind as much as any composer/conductor I can think of. Sometimes his recordings feature studio or pickup groups that are not quite on par with the top orchestras but they often are and his performances are always well worth hearing.Amazon's reviewer mentions the splendid Histoire and Octet. Stravinsky did stereo versions in 1961 though the stereo Histoire features Los Angeles musicians including violinist Israel Baker rather than the New York-based musicians in this 1954 version which includes violinist Alexander Schneider. All of these are excellent but the Histoire and Octet here in excellent mono sound get my vote as more dramatic and exciting overall.The original LP of the Histoire and Octet is a rare collector's item (the excellent notes to this set by Tim Page actually mention this) and the CD sound is superior to that of the original LPs so it's great to see this set at a low price again. Grab it quickly before only the expensive ones are left. ",5.0

" Having gotten tired of passing by my bathroom only to hear the vent fan roaring away from having been on no telling how long I looked around and found this simple one-to-one swap for my existing switch. Design-wise it is a spring loaded timer that can be set for anywhere from about 2 to 15 minutes. Setting it causes the fan to come on and then the timer simply winds down to cut the fan off after the set amount of time. The unit comes in either white or beige (which for some reason costs more on Amazon). The installation package includes screws for the power connection screws for the switch plate a plastic knob and a small plastic plate with timer markings and retainer nut. The timer plate is flanged to fit a traditional switch plate and is sized to fit into a decora styled plate. By the same token the unit has screw points for either style. In my estimation the thought that went into the design makes this a 5-star product. Obviously it does require an electrical installation and if you don't have the confidence to replace a wall switch by all means call an electrician or a more confident friend to do the work.If you are doing the install here's some info that might be useful. The unit's connection points are clearly marked as 'line' (for the input power 'hot' wire) and 'load' (for the appliance it is being connected to in my case a fan). It's usually pretty easy to determine which cable is bringing power into the junction box and normally the black wire for the cable is hot (that being said it's always best to check using a volt meter between what you think is hot and the ground wire - you obviously should drop power to the box before proceeding to installation). The timer may work if hooked up in reverse but I assume there is a reason the manufacturer has designated which connection is to be hot. The connection mechanism uses a screw with an integrated wire clamp to hold an inserted wire easy to do if you have plenty of wire to work with. In my case I didn't have long enough wires in the junction box to make this kind of connection so I first attached a pig tail wire to each connection point. For the actual install I attached each pig tail to the line and load wires in the junction box using wire nuts. Just a thought but that may well be an easier approach even if you have plenty of wire to work with. ",5.0

I was hoping that there was a more attractive alternative and the FD15MWC switch was exactly what I was looking for. So I replaced the old FF15MC with a FD15MWC and my new timer switch fits in beautifully with the two adjacent light switches and has performed flawlessly.

" Firstly let me tell you that if you are an elite critic and watched this movie ask yourself why. Do you even like the action-movie genre? No? Then don't waste our time by writing reviews about stuff you don't enjoy. We like it here and we like Hollywood. So astalavistababy.For all WWE Fans and those who have come to see John Cena blow things up by more than just his fist - this is an awesome action flick. I too came to see this movie because I am a fan of WWF now known as WWE and because I admire John Cena as a person and not just as what we see him do inside the squared ring.The first 5 to 10 minutes of the movie needs to be passed over. To be forgiven. It is not the best start to an action movie. And this is an out and out thriller of an action movie. But then Robert Patrick shows up and everything rocks and everything is cool again. Yes I came to see Cena and got bowled over by Robert Patrick. Patrick carries this movie. I would say he saved the movie. Cena is great. He is our hero. And we cheer for him throughout the movie as he gets beat while trying to rescue his dear wife. But you can't help fall for Robert Patrick. He waltzes in all bad-a$$ and mean. He is ultra uber-cool. He makes the badguy role come alive and give meaning to the whole story. As in any story for the hero to be a hero you need a strong adversary. We get that in the form of a team of criminals led by Robert Patrick.The action is non-stop. As soon as the villain has done his first job in the movie - the action keeps up the tempo and we get big gunfights and bigger explosions. The crazy black dude routine is well played here by a henchman of Patrick. I was a bit disappointed with the truth behind the 'rock candy story' - they should have made it as big as it sounded. But there is plenty of more fun in the movie. Some dark humour and Cena is incredible as he chases down the bad guys in the mandatory car chase sequence and then on in the swamps. This is thrilling from there till the very end. Some good hand-to-hand fights. Cena gets punished and he triumphs. The deviation with the 2 other crooks in the same swamp thinking Cena is a cop looking for them is also brilliant turn of events. More action. More a$$-kicking. The scenes with the explosion are very well shot.The two big ones with Cena at the petrol pump explosion and him at the shack in the swamp exploding are incredibly well captured. You could feel Cena getting the fury of the fire. Awesome stuff. And Patrick is unstoppable too. He is determined and he has the wife as a leverage and hostage. There is the essential bad girl accompanying the villain Patrick. She does a great job better I think than the actress who plays Cena's wife. In all I would rate high the casting as the team of Patrick is well picked bunch of actors doing what they do best. These bad guys are worth cheering for.Cena of course makes it to the climax. An epic one it is involving a truck a motorboat explosions fistfights splattering of blood and the suspense of whether Cena's wife will survive this ordeal or not.Watch this one and make sure you reload the popcorn.

" The Marine DVDIt's interesting to see Vince McMahan and the WWE going into another form of 'scripted entertainment' i.e. diversifying. Smart business move.This is in fact a terrific action/adventure movie in the mold of the Rambo or Schwarzenegger films (e.g. 'Commando') or the Indiana Jones series. The violence is not accurate in depiction of results but neither is it in any movie where female stars takes full-power strikes and come bouncing back. If reality counted in the movies there would be no girl-star action movies.The violence is actually toned down in favor of action. For example Sgt. Triton chooses to takes out two very tough villains in exciting brawls when he has a good fighting knife with him. Reality would have been different .... and much bloodier. Not much gore or blood in this picture however and you can safely take your pre-teen or teen son. Or yourself. My wife liked it too for that matter.Don't be surprised to see the knife on the market soon ala Rambo.The acting was top-drawer within the context of the plot. I never heard of John Cenaso I can't be considered biased. Triton was seen first in front of his commanding officer then interacting with his wife. He was supposed to be emotionally restrained with his commander and strong but a little reflective with his wife. He was. Then The Marine had a mission. He had to complete it not emote and burst into tears. After the adrenalin high wore off he'd probably start shaking but while things were going on he didn't have time to be upset. Man haven't the sweetie-boys who have panned his acting ever been in a fight? I never heard of the starbut he turned in a very believable good performance for the part. The excellent-looking wife did a fine job as well. No nudity in this movie. Unfortunately.In sum a fine example of its type and highly recommended for all. It requires some suspension of belief but most action movies do.Recommended for fans of John Cena the WWE and Arnold and Rambo for that matter.GunnerGunner December 2007 ",5.0
" The Marine is quite a phenomenal action film! The amounts of insanely addicting and devastating-looking action scenes are overwhelming. The film stars WWE wrestler John Cena in search of his wife who was kidnapped by a bunch of guys who weren't afraid to die or kill anyone who unfortunately happened to get in their way.Anyone who enjoys action films with lots of hand fighting and lots of shooting (and I mean LOTS of these things) you will definitely find yourself enjoying the Marine. It's nothing but total nonstop action for the last hour or so. The movie clocks in at 1 hour and 23 minutes (even though some other places have said the time length was a bit longer it's actually not). The negative reviews are really strange to me- John Cena himself promoted the movie as nothing but an action film. It doesn't pretend to be anything else. It's just lots and lots of ACTION!My favorite moments were the exploding gas station and the bad guys shooting Cena's car WHILE it was flipping around in the air! These are truly some of the greatest action scenes a movie could ask for. Anything better than this would be impossible! ",5.0

" I can't remember the last time I read such a dire book. I howled with laughter all the way through wondering how much worse it could get - and sure enough it got worse. If the writing is bad the plot is ludicrous. A preacher comes to offer condolences the same afternoon that the heroine's husband is shot dead. Within moments they are having sex. The sex is not sensually treated or beautifully described - no all they do is stick their tongues down each other's throats. The preacher goes to tell his paralysed wife. Her bizarre response - wait for it - is to stick her tongue down his throat. No wonder he veers away. The heroine runs off to work in the heart of Liverpool in a rose garden ten miles long (I kid you not). Did I mention she is dying? But never mind she'll make a miraculous recovery. She meets another man - even though conveniently he's dying too and she's pregnant by the preacher by now (and oh joy she hears the heartbeat of the fetus at a week... truly a miracle)! The other man lives in castle and is very rich. Of course. They consumate their affair when she sticks her tongue down his throat. Not to worry she doesn't have to perform this crude tonsil-tickling for long. The preacher turns up again. Everyone in the way drops dead leaving the coast free for the 'wicked saints' of the title to romp without blame or shame into the sunset.I could have kicked myself for buying this book; but I had been fooled by reading a mention of it by a so-called reviewer of The Mermaid Chair (which is a good book.) Then I checked all the other reviews done by reviewers of Ms Haddon's book (you can click on 'other reviews' to see what I mean) and believe I have spotted a scam. The reviewers appear to have chosen the same half dozen best sellers to review -- each on the same day! - and in each review of these other genuinely good books they mention Wicked Saints in the most glowing terms. This is cynical piggy-back riding on bona fide books made worse because this is a very badly edited (and badly written) self published book. I hope few people will be fooled as I was - and as Amazon has been. Be warned! ",1.0

" The topic explored by the author is the practice of forgery in late Antiquity to substantiate a religious cult's legitimacy. As a revised version of the author's doctoral thesis and his first book it has page after page of unnecessary excerpts whose sole purpose seems to be to let the reader know that the author really has passed his language proficiency exams. These are then followed an apology trying to explain why they really were worth quoting. It is a very boring read. Besides these stylistic annoyances the entire structure of the book takes the form of a survey of various instances of pseudepigrapha... which are then dutifully stretched back to the initial lackluster thesis. There are no fantastic insights in this book. Unless you are doing a specialization in this field I would not recommend buying this book. There are many better books in the study of religion to be savored. If you must have it for a specialization I would recommend finding it at a university library... though it may have a limited availability since it is only a revamped standard doctoral thesis that is not widely applicable in many areas of study.

Furthermore mixed in with these insane babblings are religious and political ramblings which he tries to pass off as the only possible truth.My recommendation unless you want a good laugh or evidence of the under-education of many Americans pass on this book.

No obvious indivuality or anything new to offer. Then we get to the vocals. The closest thing I can compare them to are Alison Moyet or Anthony and the johnsons. I don't mind Anthony and the Johnsons but this guys vocals and the music just don't rock. Which is fine. It's ok not to rock!

" Lewis Keel is a music teacher in the New York public school system and while my hat's off to him for devoting his life to this worthy profession I have to say that he sounds like a high school musician. Having been a high school saxophonist myself I can honestly say I recognize talent when I hear it and it isn't heard in high school bands very often.He has the technical skills to get around the instrument as he adequately demonstrates on 'Day by Day' and 'Anthropology' but he has no real touch or feeling for what he's playing. Moreover he's prone to squeaks and squawks a la the kids who play woodwinds in public school bands. Maybe I'm just tired of hearing some of the old stand-bys like 'Love for Sale' and 'Lover Come Back to Me' but if so Lewis Keel is contributing to it. His treatment of 'Quiet Nights' is about as clinical as it gets a style I would call 'Bossa Snora.'I'm sorry Lewis.

" If you can read the above lines out loud with a straight face you just might be able to take Max Brand's Donnegan seriously. The novel has several weaknesses but the one that turns it into a spectacular failure is its ludicrous framing story.Donnegan a short red-haired tramp rides the rails in search of a man named Rusty Dick (please no snickering). Having discovered that his quarry is dead Donnegan jumps off the train forces his way into a stranger's house and falls in love with the owner's daughter on the spot. The owner one Colonel Macon sends Donnegan with his daughter to the Corner a mining town hoping that the girl will win back her lover Jim Landis from the shadowy Lord Nick who has horned in on the Colonel's profitable business arrangements with Landis. Failing that Donnegan is to kill Landis.This nearly intolerable beginning then gives place to a fairly good second act; the Corner turns out to be an interesting place with interesting characters. Donnegan wins himself an ally a giant black fighting man named George Washington Green while the beautiful scheming Nelly Lebrun proves a formidable obstacle to Donnegan. Jim Landis proves to be no opponent at all but a mere human football whom the real players are fighting to possess.Donnegan's character gets more fleshed out in the second act. As in Destry Rides Again Max Brand shows a talent for portraying a hero who is severely and obviously flawed - lazy an almost pathological liar perpetually needing to prove his manhood - yet nonetheless lovable for that. Indeed Donnegan is so flawed that the story seems to be inevitably heading for a tragic denouement that might redeem the absurdity of the first act.Unfortunately there's no such luck. Almost from the minute the shadowy Lord Nick walks on the stage (his true identity should surprise no one) the story careers off into utter absurdity again. The characters' motivations none too credible to begin with now contort into self-parody. Don't feel bad if you can make no sense whatsoever out of the last few chapters; everybody including the characters themselves is just as confused as you are.Unlike many later Western authors many of whom preferred to tiptoe around the question of racism Max Brand places race relations front and center in this novel even more than in Destry Rides Again. This time we get a clearer picture of what Brand's own racial attitudes were",1.0

" Don't buy this game because you will forever wonder why you did so. This is the worst racing game I have ever played. The bonus games are crap and are all the same thing. If this was even a decent game there would be a reason to play the bonus games. But there's not. Sure you get money but with the best car in the game fully upgraded (why did I waste my time) you can't tell a difference in the race from a crap car. All the upgrades do is take your money and waste your time.The actual racing is just as bad. Sometimes when you hit a cone you will keep right on going and even get extra in your boost gauge. Other times I have gone flying off the track because of a single cone. I don't know why and at this point I really don't care.The races beyond the very first ones are way too difficult. It is more luck than skill. In other words there is almost no way to get first and you will only get in the top 3 if the other players take themselves out. Computer cars beat the best and fully upgraded car off the line and can turn corners in about half the time without losing speed. All you can do is watch them drive away.Oh and one last thing the shortcuts suck. They are not shortcuts and usually end up taking longer because it is like threading a needle and with the handling being so bad. If you even stray a little from the exact route you will be out of bounds and have to reset. If you hit anything even going very slow you will be thrown from your car and lose time. If you do manage to do it right you might still come out behind where you were. I have only found 3 races out of 75 or whatever it is that actually have a shortcut that is worth taking. And by worth taking I mean doesn't lose you time and doesn't gain it either. Talk about a crap game. Please consider not buying this game.Bottom line",1.0

" I purchased this thermometer because we wanted an accurate thermometer and were tired of the generic drug store thermometers. We definitely need to be provided an accurate on spot temp due to my daughters health issues. I was super excited to receive this thermometer right away!!! Shipping was GREAT! I opened it read the manual and then took her temp ( knowing she was hot ) it said 98.8. I pulled out our old thermometer and it registered 100.4 THIS IS AN ISSUE! I thought maybe it was just this one time and tried it again later that evening knowing she was still running a fever. It read 99.9 old thermometer read 100.9. YET AGAIN AN ISSUE!!! I continued to try both thermometers the next day while she still had a temp and STILL had the same large variation in temps. My husband decided to call the company. No answer no answering service. He called WelchAllyn since we had no response from the Medical Supply Company. They asked if we purchased this thermometer in June? He said ummm no we just bought it 5 days ago. The associate said well this thermometer is registered as being purchased in June and we aren't sure if this Medical Supply company is a registered seller of these WelchAllyn thermometers. They are having a supervisor call us tomorrow. We called the Medical supply company yet again and finally had someone answer unfortunately they seem like they could care less about the fact that it is not working and they definitely do not care that this could have been previously owned and returned. They told us there is a 15% restocking fee for returning it unless WelchAllyn says it was previously owned. WHAT!!! So they don't know if they are selling items that are previously owned and obviously faulty? The associate at WelchAllyn said this may have been returned due to being faulty and now is being sold as 'New' through this company. THIS IS RIDICULOUS CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SALES SERVICE!!!! These thermometers may be PREVIOUSLY OWNED AND USED AND BEING SOLD AS 'NEW'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will update this as soon as a I speak with a supervisor tomorrow! ",1.0
" This was the first book I've read by Jamaica Kincaid and it will be my last.This book was not only BAD it was depressing. Xuela didn't loved anyone because no one loved her. She was a bitter and angry person. The line 'I did not know my mother because she died at the moment of my birth' was repeated about 100 times throughout the book.I don't know why the book was named 'Autobiography of my Mother' because she never knew her mother and constantly throughout the book said so. She hated her father because he was in a position of 'power' and took advantage of others. One other thing that bothered me about this book was her habit of touching her private parts in public and smelling her hands after. I found this hard to believe that Xuela would be so 'free' in Dominica at the time period in this book. Touching ones self is taboo among most black people whether you're born in Africa America or the West Indies.The only interesting part about this book is when her lover's wife confronted her in the street.Maybe if the book wasn't written in such a 'defeated and depressing' way it would have been better but the author's tone contridicts Xuela's 'I-don't-care-about-anyone' attitude. Xuela stated she was content or happy with herself but the tone didn't suggest that at all. ",1.0
" I really wanted to like this book based on the title and the cover art. Instead I found myself not caring about the narrator whatsoever. She repeats the same few thoughts throughout the entire book. She reminds the reader that her mother is dead and that nobody loves her so many times that I stopped caring about her situation. Her repetition and monotone voice stops the narrator from being truly developed as a character that we can connect with. Some parts of her story seem unnecessary and pointless as they don't really lead to anything of interest later on. Her characterization was too direct and left nothing for the reader to consider for themselves. The title is extremely misleading as we learn absolutely nothing about her mother- aside from her death during childbirth. I am unable to find anything positive to describe about this book sadly.

The problem with the Umbra rods -- all of them -- is NO tension. I have tried these repeatedly.... Why? Because my local hardware store carries them and they are readily available elsewhere and I have opted for form over function. Every single Umbra rod I have used fails drastically. They simply cannot bear any weight. Or to put it differently they cannot exert enough force against the surfaces they extend out to for them to bear any load. Worse the springs that are the key element in sustaining the tension tend to fail. When those springs fail anything you have suspended by the rod will come down.

" Three or four years back I wrote a screenplay about a Marine who comes back from IRAQ. He is struggling to adapt to civilian life and hold onto his relationship with his wife when she is abducted in a bank robbery.As his life crumbles and the police seem less interested in recovering his wife he goes the vigilante route tracking interrogating and diving into dangerous situations ultimately leading him to Las Vegas where he uncovers a large scale plot that is bigger than he or anyone could ever imagine.Other than the fact that my script is more complex and has better dialogue the biggest difference between my script and THE MARINE is that the lead character in my script is REAL. A real flesh and blood human being Marine with vulnerabilities emotions and he actually bleeds. He's a real person like somebody you might know from your town who went to Iraq.While THE MARINE'S John Triton (John Cena) is bulletproof explosion proof dives through walls unscratched hangs onto semi-trucks while it drives through buildings and despite the bombardment of boards pipes and tin sheets he rolls off and groans before jumping up and kicking more butt. Not to mention I don't think a scene goes by that he doesn't remind everybody that he's a Marine and it's the only thing he knows. By the way the tin sheets would have severed him easily.Oh and of course the name Triton is appropriate to refer to John Cena as a Greek God or the largest moon of Neptune.Ridiculous is an understatement. This movie insults our intelligence with a symplistic unrealistic poorly written story. Deplorable acting from all involved. Was this movie trying to be a comedy? The jewl thieves are idiots and are more concerned with trying to be comedic than to try to come up with a plan to escape.The real shame is that my script is pretty well useless now. The creators of this movie make dozens of references to my script in the early goings and now my script is old news. Unfortunately hollywood big wigs have put their MONEY behind THE MARINE a silly poorly written poorly thought out poorly acted piece of junk.You need more than dozens of unrealistic and over-the-top explosions to grab this reviewer. Unfortunately I have a brain and I need more from my action movie than this stupid movie that has absolutely nothing in it that is memorable or meritable. ",1.0

The marine chases after these guys killing them one by one. You'd think they'd just give him back his wife. She means nothing to them. Give her back and they can go on with their criminal business. But no. They hold on to her.The marine runs/jumps in slow motion away from explosions at least 4 times in this movie.

" This film is complete and total garbage i mean its really bad. John plays a Marine who gets kicked out of the Corps after defying orders to save the lives of some Marines. I wont even get into that rats nest of crap. So he is discharged from the Marines and is trying to start working a civilian job. While on a road trip with his wife some people who robbed a jewelery store and happened to stop at the same gas station end up kidnapping his wife and begins his outrageously stupid and ill scripted pursuit. Fact is John was able to track his targets through the marsh and swamp while quite often they were on a road. The thought process that i have would be is that they could take any back road/dirt road or anything that connect to the main road they would be gone and he would be heading in the completely wrong direction. However somehow he is always able to find the bad guys. My biggest complain is that it is a movie about a Marine and he never really uses a gun he takes them and never uses them. I think the person who wrote it doesn't realize that every Marine is a rifleman and i cannot think of one who wouldn't use a gun to protect his wife. This movie is your standard WWE/WWF film that solves everything with hand to hand combat scenes. I mean come on if i would of wanted to watch a fighting movie then that is what i would've bought. However i bought a movie titled MARINE i fully expect there to be FIREFIGHTS and shooting. That is what really irritates me along with the pathetic acting is that it doesn't make sense. Marines are trained to use guns but this guy doesn't seem to use them even when his wife is in danger.I'm not really sure i can convey to you how bad this movie is.It would be a good film for people who prefer hand to hand combat and like movies with really bad acting and holes in the plot so big you can drive a semi truck threw them.This movie starts out bad and just gets worse and worse.Horrible Movie 1/5 stars.

" I gave this movie a chance because Robert Patrick was in it. He couldn't give it any justice at all. The action was over the top and unrealistic. The criminals were all cliched especially the African-American criminal. (Don't know why they always have to make African-American characters have a smart mouth it's too stereotypical) John Cena can't act his way out of a paper bag and he's too damn bulky with his cucumber fingers. The car chase scene with all them bullets hitting the car and Cena is still driving and able to avoid every single bullet. He's hit with multiple objects but still no mark on him. The wife gets knocked the hell out so many times but no bruise on her at all. This movie was ridiculous don't waste your time unless you're a Cena mark. ",1.0
" Now The Marine doesn't try to be a good movie it lets you know right from the beginning what it is going to be. A huge muscleman marine is told to wait for the rest of the soldiers on a mission. He says 'not enough time' and charges in to blow things up. Next scene he is being discharged and has to go find a job as a security guard. This is all in the first 2 minutes of the movie. The thing that really bothered me about the movie was that everything that went on really had no point and did not make a difference later in the film. That isn't the only thing they weren't able to complete not by a long shot. The bad guys have this big black guy on their side and he is not unfunny they just don't give him anything funny to say. I seriously think that he didn't complete a single joke. In fact the liquid metal guy from Terminator 2 stars as the main bad guy and they even throw in a reference to that and it was the only joke they actually completed. I thought that it was the least bad part of the movie.Now the reason I went to see this was becasue I was told it had great fights. The shootouts were nice to look at and the explosions became so repetitious I almost fell asleep but the fights were once again just the same old I hit you and then you hit me style. The best fight of the movie included 2 characters who were never explained and this scene could have been from entirely different film for all I know.

" You really have to give it up to wrestling promoter Vince McMahon. He has failed miserably with the WBF XFL and programs on MTV & he couldn't sell a quality meal in New York City. So Vince now tries that magic business touch in the film industry. Huh?It appears that Vince has just a little jealousy towards 'The Rock' Dwayne Johnson and his great success making movies to the point where he doesn't need to do any bumps for the WWE and the McMahon family. Granted Vince receives a nice sum of cash for Johnson's wrestling moniker to be used for movies but that just isn't enough.And where Johnson has long-since passed up the 1980s-styled superhero genre here comes Vince lumbering along in his powerwalk with his answer to The Rock John Cena. Yes that John Cena who was going to be a hip-hop star; until he proved that he has no hip and zero hop in his mic skills.But have a script comparable with Sylvester Stallone's ridiculous Rambo character - with Cena's mannerisms that could be termed as the nephew to the fictional tough-guy - blow all kinds of things up and Vince is in business. Hardly.The first weekend in theaters October 13-15 2006 The Marine did a tepid $7 million in box office sales and then sank faster than a pay-per-view main event featuring Fit Finlay.Cena plays his WWE role well but he isn't a real actor. Vince is a wrestling promoter who has failed each time he has stepped outside the family business. The Marine was produced 20-plus years too late to have anyone but the biggest WWE Cena fans taking time to see it in theaters.And Vince better keep that cozy economic reality in mind for the next flick.

Im not going to go into every stupid part of this movie but ill just say its EXTREMELY unrealistic. its so bad i think a 5 year old can point out the ridiculous things john cena 'can' do. for example hes able to practically fly and jump onto a moving truck from standing on the ground. he is also able to survive being inside a building that blows up and looks as though the atom bomb was dropped on it yet somehow he still is alive. also i might be crazy but im pretty sure if you were holding onto a truck and being rammed through a building at fast speeds you wouldnt live. also not many people i know can run through walls and not be hurt. speaking of not being hurt there is an instance in the movie while inside a burning building john cena is hit by falling burning wood and is unaffected. this movie is awful and i would recommend if your looking for an action movie to look somewhere else. i cant believe people actually buy this movie and can watch it without wanting to cry.

" ...really quite staggeringly breathtakingly bad - unless you're particularly fond of big explosions that is in which case you'll absolutely love it. If you don't prepare for a totally ridiculous tale woodenly acted without much conviction. Not even Robert Patrick's nasty chief villain can save this monumental turkey.

" I am a huge fan of science fiction and fantasy and have been reading these books for 20 years. I picked up the Foundation books because Asimov was supposed to be so great and I really enjoyed his short stories. This book - all of the books in this series - is so amazingly boring it could be used to replace Thorazine. The concept was solid but the characters made me not care at all. I kept hoping they would die simply so there would be something interesting happening. If you must read it check it out from the library and save your money. Unless of course you're a chronic insomniac; then by all means buy this book. ",1.0
" I bought this book because Asimov is supposedly one of the sci-fi greats but if this book is a good example of his work his reputation is overblown. I found the characters to be flat and one dimensional. The story uses unrealistic plot devices. Yes I understand that it's science fiction but I find it strains credulity to think that the characters were able to invent a religion worlds-spanning religion in 30 years. It also didn't seem very likely that a 12000-year-old empire would so quickly crumble into the stone age (I'm exaggerating slightly). I realize that this book was written in 1951 but the high tech stuff in the story was hardly high tech back then much less in an empire spanned the galaxy.Bottom line",1.0

" I enjoy Asmov's science books. They are informative clever and witty. But his science fiction is another matter. They are poorly written. And worse I didn't believe a word of Foundation.

Just one example of the difficulties of prediction",1.0
" So many people like this book and have called it a 'classic' - I felt I had to read it. I am not a hard-core sci-fi reader but I did enjoy reading books by Herbert Heinlein Bradbury and the like. So I though I'd give Asimov a chance. To my surprise I didn't like this book at all.I have read some bad books in my life but this is the first bad book I bothered to read all the way through. I kept waiting for it to get better. I kept waiting for the 'eureka' moment when I finally understood why everyone likes this book so much. It never happened and when I finally came to the end of the book I realized that Mr. Azimov stole a good two hours of my life and gave me NOTHING in return.The story sounds interesting and in the hands of another writer it may have bore fruit. Unfortunately in Mr Asimoz's hands the story falls flat in the implementation. Had the writing not been funny I would have been completely bored. Of course Mr. Azimov did not intentionally make me laugh - sadly his understanding of the human condition appears to be based largely on old cheap pulp fiction novels. The characters are completely one dimensional and unconvincing. I truly cannot understand why anyone would like this book - but calling it a classic is simply unbearable. I can only assume that most of the people reviewing this book favorably are children. In any case they are certainly not familiar with truly good writing. My advice",1.0
" Being a sci-fi fan myself I decided I wanted to try reading some of the works by the giants of sci-fi. I had always heard how great 'Foundation' was so I thought I'd start with this one. I was thoroughly disappointed! Asimov used way too many large words ('using dollar words where dime words would suffice'). The story seemed to jump around from one time to another. The characters were very one-dimensional and very flat...I didn't have that 'I wonder what's going to happen next to ---'. I just didn't care what was going to happen next to the characters or in the story. There didn't seem to be anything to propel this story along; nothing to develop the characters or the story. I read over 100 pages and I still had no interest in what was happening. (Even Stephen King who can be pretty tough to get into his stories has me hooked within 50 to 60 pages!) I just don't get what all the hype is over this book. Could someone out there PLEASE tell me! I will try to get into his Robot series...maybe he has better character and story development in them...I hope! ",1.0
" The Foundation is completely undeserving of the fame accredited to it. Had it been more eloquently executed the collage of textbook style narrative and bad dialogue might have been sufficient to generate a bearable story. All the social concepts Asmov brings up are well worn and ill-portrayed on the backdrop of a generic illogical sci-fi universe. His writing style is bland and every one of his characters can be found by an other name in star wars. ",1.0
" After somehow assiduously avoiding Asimov's seminal 'masterpiece' for over 50 years since I began reading sci-fi I decided to dip into this ponderous tome.Oh forsooth the ancient bard's Shakespearean language came alive once more only this time more than 12000 years into the future.But lo some things have never changed",1.0
" I just finished reading Foundation and was extremely disappointed. Maybe I was expecting too much something grander along the line of the Dune series. But the book in of itself is an extreme disappointment. I realize Asimov was young (21) when he wrote this but his style leaves a lot to be desired. I'll take an early Arthur C. Clarke book over Asimov any day. This is the first book by Asimov I've read and I'm not sure I want to read another. His style is very dialogue driven with very few if any detail given to what the characters think. Everyone is very two-dimensional. And he never describes any of the scenes were all of this dialog takes place. Part of the interest in science-fiction is exploring new places seeing different things. This entire story could have taken place on an empty stage. In fact it seems like it's written more for a play than a novel. As for the story it starts out interestingly enough. The Empire is going to crumble and to avoid thousands of years of dark-ages a Foundation is set up to preserve the past learning's of the Empire. Well that's what the original thought was at least. Soon we discover there's an alternate motive to this. Once we learn of this motive the story goes straight downhill. Asimov skips decades from one page to another. Characters are introduced that we know practically nothing about and he never tells us anything about them. I've read history books that had more character development than he gives the people in this book. By the time I got to the end I found myself saying 'So what'? Am I supposed to continue on reading this series because it's been called a 'classic'. I've seen the word 'classic' thrown around a little too much sometimes. This is definitely one of those times.

" Recently finding myself with a lot of time on my hands after having just graduated school I started picking up and reading a lot of the 'greatest' works of science fiction. After having noticed all the editorials reviews and awards attributed to the Foundation series I didn't hesitate to order all the books in the series. What a mistake! I'm not sure what people are seeing in these novels but in no way do they even come close to approaching some of the other hallmarks of sci-fi like Dune Ender's Game you name it. This book has a semi-interesting setup about trying to preserve civilization during a coming galactic dark age but beyond that the book devolves into stupid scenario after scenario about how the Foundation is threatened but through the citizens' skill (i.e. sheer stupidity and dumb luck) they manage to somehow make it through the crisis only to face another yawner a few pages later. In between each crisis numerous years elapse so by the time Asimov sets up the next unrelated crises the entire cast of characters changes -- you barely have time to figure out their names much less get to know any person in significant detail.This series of books did nothing but put me to sleep on multiple occassions when normally if a book is good I'll stay up all night to finish it. My advice is to steer well clear from this series and try one of the other highly rated sci-fi books out there -- there are so many others that would be far preferable. ",1.0

It probably could have been rewritten replacing historical language instead of spacefare and it would not have mattered in the slightest. The only science fictional element was Psychohistory which is not developed at all due to the nature of the plot. If this is a classic I shall stick to more obscure and worthwhile reads. Blech. ",1.0

" I have not read James Marcus' book 'Amazonia' but in a recent NPR interview he insisted that during his Amazon tenure he was never pressured to write positive reviews of things he found crappy. However Amazon's editorial review above makes me doubt such a claim. If the guy had said this movie is so bad that it's good I could accept that. But to suggest that 'Mean Guns' has redeeming qualities that anyone involved with it actually intended it to have? You've got to be kidding.Also do not believe the overall user rating for this movie or the low ratio of helpful to unhelpful votes that my review will inevitably get (assuming anyone ever actually reads it). Most people who have rated it are probably Christopher Lambert fans so they obviously have no taste. For anyone who realizes Lambert has less acting talent than a dead dog let me inform you that 'Mean Guns' is actually terrible. I will admit that I found it to be enjoyably bad -- the incompetence of everyone involved gave me a few pretty good laughs. But enjoyably bad is still bad. I will say this -- at least it was not nearly as horrible as the previous Pyun-Lambert project 'Adrenalin",1.0
" MEAN GUNS is a vile pointless movie with no redeeming qualities. The horrible acting of Ice T has never been so flagrantly evidenced as in this loser.

Armed with not only guns but baseball bats the movie is one long let's see how many people we can kill in ninety minutes. The murders are offensively brutal and with a plot that limps along one has to wonder why this movie was even made. How can we root for anyone when they are all heartless cold-blooded killers? Christopher Lambert the stone faced hero of B movies even brings along his little daughter to wait in the car while the murders go on. The movie tries to embrace some kind of code of honor among murderers but is there honor among these low lifes? One female actress who plays Barbie is so obnoxious I couldn't wait for her to meet her demise and it takes a long time to happen too.

This may be the only movie in which a character not only does the splits while wearing a suit and a tie but he also does it in khakis.8. Does he punch someone in the balls? To be honest I can't say I remember it happening. However given the fact that I dozed off during several scenes it's entirely possibly that JCVD performed a fistectomy.9. Does he do a series of flying or 360 kicks? In every single fight.10. Is his enemy unbeatable? Hardly. He's just a little Asian guy with big hair and a black belt.11. Does he overcome an injury or other hindrance? Aside from being a Belgian acting as a Russian and speaking in broken English...not really.12. Does he win? It doesn't matter - the viewer loses.Some planes go down over the Mediterranean and three were carrying top secret laser guidance systems. The rest is a race to get them before the Russians. Somehow a Japanese guy codenamed 'Black Eagle' goes in for the United States and a Belgian guy goes in for the Russians. And that's probably the movie's biggest problem; it's nearly incomprehensible the majority of the time because of various language barriers that aren't overcome.A fan of JCVD action or good movies will be severely disappointed. He's barely in the movie and the rest is just bad. When you begin to crave the acting talents of JCVD then you know the rest of the movie is slop. This is definitely a blemish on his career; I'm just not sure if it's wart or a zit. ",1.0
" Now don't take this into the wrong direction. I like Van Damme as well as Sho Kosugi but even they couldn't save this film from being so boring and so abysmal. I was so bored by this film that not only did I fall asleep during the film I couldn't even finish the thing.An F-11 holding a device that the United States government cannot afford to lose crash lands in the Mediterranean. The KGB lead by Andrei (Played by Van Damme) unfortunately are much closer to finding the device than the CIA. The United States government decides to send in their best man Ken Tani The Black Eagle (Played by Kosugi). Tani decides to head to Malta with his two kids (Played by Kosugi's own children) to find the device before the KGB does.I have nothing else to say about this crap except that even if you're a Van Damme superfan don't bother and just leave it in the $3 bin at BigLots! I'm actually quite surprised Van Damme's career wasn't ruined by this travesty. Then again he was just getting started.Not Recommended.DVD Extras",1.0

There is nothing in this book for a parent in the thick of childrearing.

" I bought this backpack when I wanted to have a new bag for my laptop. I got a good JanSport Backpack for my niece a few month ago and she liked that one so I chose JanSport again. It's out of question that JanSport is generally a good brand.But this particular backpack is really poorly made. The texture is made by some cheap materials and definitely looks not as good as the picture shown on the website. There are not many compartments in the bag with poor paddings and the space is not as big as that was described at all. Nevertheless the laptop sleeve is too wide for my 15' widescreen notebook. So I bought another backpack of Swissgear this weekend when I saw it on sale with only one third price of this JanSport. And the quality of my new bag is Much Much Much BETTER than this one.Don't buy this backpack! ",1.0
" I had a Jansport pack which I dragged all over the world for 12 years. It finally needed some serious repairs and I sent it in.

I'm 6' and don't have unusual proportions so this is kind of disturbing.Second the weird laptop pocket in the main compartment is an incredible design flaw. The rigid support at the bottom is about two inches above the bottom of the backpack so if you load the pack whatever you put in can't ride against your lower back and effectively pulls the backpack into a curve so you feel the very straight rather uncomfortable stays at the bottom of the laptop pocket and the top of the shoulder straps.It's simply not an acceptable pack for day to day use as it's designed.

" As a molecular biologist & a HUGE red sox fan I was very excited to see how Polidoro handled the controversy associated with his subject. Well he didn't... in the story as he presented it there was no controversy with the exception of a few animal rights activists. Are you kidding me?!? The entire story was unbelievable baseless naive and repetitive. On top of that it was also incredibly poorly written. Which brings me to the question I ask in my review title. Did anyone edit this book? The dialog was cringe-worthy the story flowed horribly and there were numerous grammatical errors. Not to mention the huge errors in timeline continuity! My favorite involved a character telling her husband that she's just found out that she's pregnant and attributes it to a sex act that took place over 8 months earlier in the story. How does an editor not catch that? All in all it's typical of a book by someone who has what could be a very interesting topic but thinks that all you need to do to write a good book is put together a happy ending story and randomly plop in a bunch of lame pop culture historical and geographical references (what do the swans in the public garden have to do with anything??)

Billed as an erotic book of essays it did not succeed with its task.The author seems to dwell in his promiscuity but bores us with stories about his furniture and odd stains on his upholstery instead of telling us how those stains got there.In another essay he tells of his dying lover in the hospital and the last time they performed together then at the funeral his lover's nurse comes to tell him that he was 'with' the lover several times--and the author thought that was comforting. Yet there were no details of any of these couplings.There is a point when trying to write erotica intelligently which I am all for that the writer inadvertantly eradicates all hints of passion and heat. The author completely leaves his readers cold and unmoved and still not in the mood which is unfortunate. This book could have been very steamy and still maintained its dignity had the writer moved into the scenes and relived the physicality of his sessions. But no we are to read about distant memories that have no feeling or touch attached.Instead of this book being labeled and marketed as erotica it should have been listed as autobiographic...and if these are the highlights of a life I feel sorry for the subject--how can one lead a life so boring?

It tends to get scorched on the stove top plus takes a long time (not so long in hindsight).

It seems to only be available online either from Amazon or Walmart (online only).

The manual mentioned that white rice would be ready in about 30 minutes but did not mention how long it took for brown rice to cook though it had some suggested recipes. I just cooked basic brown rice in a small quantity. Well it took one and a half hours for it to be done and it was quite soggy. I was not willing to keep the item and 'tweak' the process to try to get decent rice so I cleaned it up and repacked it and checked on the return process.

The 2002 edition ought to be much better and probably quite a good study guide. I however have not seen it and do not know for sure but PR should be a fairly respectable test prep. company.Happy GREs...hahaha ",1.0
" Many computer books and study guides are sold on the basis that they are huge and - by implication - full of wisdom and knowledge. On closer inspection they turn out to be weak and muddled. This book falls into this category and then some. It is about the worst I've come across. Obviously rushed out to meet some kind of marketing need and consequently packed with errors. I actually came to Amazon to see what others said about it after struggling to understand the logical errors I thought I was coming across. Here's a nice but rather obvious example",1.0
" This book has a different approach of studying for the GRE Chemistry exam. Instead of spoonfeeding you all the correct answers to the questions it gives you all the wrong information so that you will be forced to think if every single item is correct or not. Since Chemistry is a very strict subject meaning if one atom or bond is misplaced everything becomes invalid reading the book becomes a tedious experience rather than an enriching experience. It is very sad that the Princeton publishers did not even bother to proofread the book and if they ever even bother it is most likely for grammatical purposes rather than for the Chemistry content. I have written to the Princeton publishers reagarding this issue and all they can say is they are very sorry that I am disappointed. Do you think that is enough compensation to the disappointment I have regarding this book? I have heard that they are planning to release a new edition. Honestly with this kind of previous editions I would discourage anybody to buy this book. I think it would be more effective if you just stick to your old textbooks. ",1.0

" As other reviewers have suggested this book is FULL of errors. I used this book (along with the official guide and the REA book which is much better) for my preperation and found it to be virtually useless. There are so many errors that I found myself unable to trust the book as a source on any information that I didn't already know to be accurate. Which of course defeats the purpose of a study guide. Many of the mistakes are obvious but perhaps more problematic are the several instances where the author explains a subtle point in error.This book is not worth the time. ",1.0
" Poor chemists -- don't you wish a book existed that could meet your needs at this level? This book as previously noted contains more errors than you probably made on your last organic chemistry exam. Some mistakes are obvious but I highly recommend avoiding this book because even the little things may mislead you. If you are looking to study for the GRE I recommend picking up the Harcourt Brace College Outline Series books on College Chemistry and Physical Chemistry if you haven't already. If you want a book to study for organic chemistry try finding a Kaplan MCAT book on organic chemistry or at least one that has an organic chemistry section. As for instrumentation and inorganic go back and ask friends or reread your notes and textbooks. ",1.0

" As other people have said this book is full of typos wrong formula names mis-representation of structural formulas etc. I can't underestimate the number of mistakes in this book. I bought the new edition of the book hoping that these issues had been addressed and resolved but they have not. New typos have arisen and are in the same magnitude as the first edition.It is a nice general concise review but only if you want to double-check every fact in the book that may seem questionable. I have been using this book to review for my Qualifying exams for grad school and find that it's frustrating to use. However it does keep you on your toes and constantly running to your text books to double check facts. I'm not sure if that is a good thing though... Come test time it wouldn't be hard to become confused between what is right and what you saw in the book. A much better review book would be Schaum's Outlines but they are much more detailed and not as general. This is both good and bad. I was hoping to have a general review book that I could use to supplement my undergrad texts. Obviously this is not the book.In general run away from this book.

" This book based on limited family input collected circa 1856 then written after all of John Mercier McMullen's siblings were deceased in 1902 has been proven by his genetic male descendants based on DNA testing and extensive genealogical research to have been a political fabrication. It was not published in 1902 or following his death in 1908 by any surviving male relations of John M McMullen including his own sons. Rather it was a maternal grandaughter who published it in 1960. His motivation in modifying fabricating or in several cases actually eliminating truthful information appears to have been a desire for acceptance by the British aristocracy of the day in his Upper Canadian village of Brockville. This resulted in an effort by John McMullen to position his historical family as pro-UBE anti Irish and of lowland Scot extraction. The facts suggest exactly the opposite with oral history as provided by sibling descendants genetic DNA test results and actual interviews with Irish families in the village of Kells Co. Kilkenny (where John came from not the north of Ireland) who knew this family as late as 1950. An example of fabrication would be his statement that James McMullen was one of the 13 apprentices of Derry exposed as a falsehood in correspondence with the association itself.

" Tom Lehrer once said that political satire died the day Henry Kissinger was given the Nobel Peace Prize. Thus it is with cinematic satire as this film won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. There is no story of any worth here. It adds nothing to our understanding of the human condition (which other reviewers seem to imply is where its value lies) per se it is merely a series of sketches in search of a coherent theme which fails qua entertainment. McKellan and Redgrave do their best but with such prosaic material to work off they cannot save a very boring film whose raison d'etre escapes the ever increasing somnolent viewer. That it won an Oscar for the screenplay says far more about the Academy's often appalling decisions than anything else. Perhaps like the American Presidency lobby money can buy anything. ",1.0

" James Whale is an old deceprit man. He has lived a life of fame thanks to his direction of the first two Frankenstein movies. When Whale begins trying to sketch his new gardener Clay Boone memories of his past begin to flood his mind. Boone eventually finds out that Whale is homosexual. While this makes him uneasy he returns over and over again. The film follows their strange relationship.One of the problems I have with this movie is the fact that it focuses entirely on Whale's sexual preference. Are viewers not supposed to care about anything else besides his homosexuality? Because I do.Also the relationship between Boone and Whale is a perpetually bizarre one. Despite how uncomfortable he sometimes becomes when in Whale's presence Boone cannot keep himself away. I found it quite unbelievable.Lastly this movie is incredibly monotonous. Nothing really interesting occurs until the last thirty minutes.Near the end James asks Clay 'Do you believe people come into our lives for a purpose?' Well I believe that all films should have a purpose whether that be to make people laugh cry or ponder. This one simply doesn't. ",1.0

" Sharing my experience with a recent purchase of velodyne vx-11Why i say poor product quality?1. Unit not working and faulty which means no quality assessment and checks2. Volume control knob connected in the ICs are not working which means potential sub standard material. Is this a common issue in china made products and patented in the US?3. Amp was found faulty yet this is a new product.Another example of poor QC check and poor components.Why I say bad service reputation?1. I was upfront when I placed the order that the product will be used in Singapore and even requested for 220 voltage product. My request was declined due to policy though they sell 220 voltage to the local dealer in sg.2. I placed the order and mentioned that I will use a step down power converter to make it work. I was not informed that the unit is not able to support power converter only later on when I reported that the product is not working.3. When I received the unit and found that it is not working I felt they are not committed to help and was told that the warranty has been voided because the product was used outside US. I was informed that the unit is not able to support converter. They even mentioned shipping as possible cause of damage. Any service check will be my cost.4. Went to see a known service center and found that the problem is not due to the converter. Infact the internal components when the service staff open the sub has a 110 and 230 volts selection.

" Two weeks ago I purchased this Black and Decker product from my local CVS store in California. Brand-new out of the package it wouldn't work. I felt reassured that at least it had a two year warranty and was a 'name brand' of Black and Decker. I was shocked when I phoned the Black and Decker service center in Texas the 800-544-6986 that was included with the warranty info ...and they told me that since the item had been manufactured three years earlier (there was a 2007 date-sticker on product) and since this product had been discontinued by Black and Decker they could not honor the warranty for repair or replacement.I informed the Black and Decker service-center manager [Anita] that it was not legal for Black and Decker to claim 'no responsibility' for their warranty and they couldn't refuse to honor their warranty just because they discontinued the item (particularly because I had just purchased it two weeks prior & had my receipt). She then gave me a local Black and Decker service-center phone number in California where the representative ('Dave') informed me that because the item was discontinued by Black and Decker 'I was out of luck' and there was nothing they could do. It was just suggested I return the item to the store.Beware consumers! Black and Decker is setting new precedents in skirting their legal responsibilities regarding honoring their product-warranties. It seems that since the volume of complaints are so high regarding Black and Decker products not much attention is being paid to this negligence on Black and Decker's part (and who has the time and money to bring a 'breach of warranty' case to court for a $50. item?)After this experience I will never again have confidence in the Black and Decker name and I urge you to consider researching consumer-complaints about this company's customer-service before purchasing Black and Decker products.Tom in Encinitas California ",1.0

Keep in mind that this story occurred in 1820. I hardly think that the use of the politically correct term African American was even conceived at that time. The author also seems to want to build the case that because the black members of the crew were the first to die that there may have been racial reasons for this to occur. He discusses the difference in body fat content between blacks and whites and the closeness of the Nantucket Quakers which may have accounted for the whites being treated differently while trying to survive at sea.

" 'In the Heart of the Sea' is a classic story of sailors stranded at sea. However it does have some gruesome parts that classic stories like 'Moby Dick' and 'Two Years before the Mast' don't have. For instance there is much death and cannibilism. The story is told by a narrattor and is about how the Nantucket whaleship the Essex is wrecked by a sperm whale and how they must survive in three whaleboats with built up sides. The story is true and what the book Moby Dick is based on.This book is very imformative but I did not like the way it was written and it dragged in many parts. I would not recomend this book. ",1.0

" I tried getting this adapter to work on my own for a month and half. Every once in awhile it would work. But very rarely. Unfortunately there are very few settings you can access in TIVO to troubleshoot any problems. It would also fail at different steps so I think I received every error message TIVO has. I finally called TIVO support. The only thing they knew to try was turn the TIVO on and off (like I had not tried that a 100 times already). They did say they were aware of alot of customers getting N17 error and they had not been able to fix on their end. They said since it had been more than 30 days since I received the device I would need to buy another one and they suggested not buying a TIVO adapter this time.On a positive note I called and explained to Amazon that I could not get the thing to work. Since it was a gift they were having trouble finding the original order. But stayed at it until they did. They then said they would send me another unit. THANKS Amazon!

" I bought this wireless adapter for my TiVo Series 2 DVR planning to eliminate the phone line I used to connect to the service and allow enhanced TiVo functions. Unfortunately it never worked. I followed the instructions carefully. The power was on based on the light on the adapter but the thing never recognized my wireless network. My apartment complex has many wireless networks. It could not even recognize one of the many I can see in my wifi selection list. This was not a matter of the password being needed. It simply did not recognize the presence of a wireless network.I checked the connection to the USB port and followed all the troubleshooting suggestions on the DVR screen as well as the TiVo website.I wasted 2 hours on the phone with a TiVo tech support guy. He wanted me to open ALL the ports of my router and a few other things. I have an Apple AirPort networs and a Lynksys network as well. The tech support people at both manufacturers had no idea.I finally gave up. I connected my TiVo directly to the internet with an ethernet connector. Since I have only one internet modem and hence use only one wireless router I have to manually connect the TiVo every couple of days and let it download the programming data. Then I reconnect the ethernet cable to my wireless router so I can have internet connection available for my computers.If the TiVo USB wireless adapter worked I could have constant internet connectivity to my TiVo making it a much better DVR.As it is I have TiVo which I love without the many enhanced functions I wanted.

The wireless router and modem are barely 30 feet from the TiVo box with open space throughout. My laptop easily achieves 12Mbps without a hitch.For a goof we moved the wireless router and modem to the kitchen table and hooked it up to the laptop.

" We received our Baby Born doll today and quickly got our son to distract our daughter so that we could get a quick peak at her Christmas present. At first we thought the doll was adorable. However after our daughter went to bed we got it out of the packaging before wrapping it (it is one of our pet peeves to spend Christmas morning wrestling with wires and cardboard) and attempted to discover all of its 'functions.' Supposedly it 'squeals with delight.' I kept looking for some way to make this baby do something -- anything -- and then my husband took it and forcefully squeezed its left arm and finally a pitiful squeak came out. It is not a 'squeal of delight' but more like a dog toy squeak. Not only that but no 38 pound girl could muscle up the strength to make this doll squeak. It came with two tubes and no directions as to where to put these tubes. I have edited anatomy textbooks so I'm not dumb as far as where the possible orifices might be! There was just no logical explanation for these strange tubes that we could find even after reading every single piece of paperwork. So tossing the tubes aside we tried to give her water. It leaked out of her neck (no surprise what with the missing tubes). We packaged the entire sham back up and really really hope that they give us our money back -- minus the shipping charge. What a scam. We are hoping for better luck with Corelle. I'm just happy we didn't keep it in the packaging only to have our daughter be the disappointed one on Christmas morning while she discovered its 'functions.' ",1.0

When you give the doll water it instantly starts peeing better when it is laying down than when it sits on the potty. No matter how you turn it and how you close or open the valve IT LEAKS. I could not see any tears no matter how I turned it. Overall big waste of money I would STRONGLY RECOMMEND AGAINST IT.

" Factually shaky at many points pedestrian prose self-aggrandizing and a page turner only for wanting to finish the awful thing.

Having been on climbing expeditions before there is a great deal of stress raw feelings etc but the raw and condescending behavior of the author and trip leaders is disgusting.

" I give this book one star because it made nice lining for my bird cage. Others have described more eloquently than I can why this is not a good book to read. I found the author mean pompous and racist. As a climber of many years I can honestly say I would never tie into a rope with her. ",1.0
" Ruth Anne Kocour the greatest female climber of all time documents her extreme valor in saving all souls on the mountain. Climbers live by a certain code we help each other. Ms. Kocour apparently believes she is above and beyond helping the sick and dying climbers. She believes that 'the best thing mountaineers can do for others is to take care of themselves'. When sitting in camp not even a particularly high camp at that climbers help one another. The summit is the goal but it is not what is most important. Ms. Koncour could not find the time to help out a climber who was in need of medical attention because she was busy clearing snow from her tent something she did every few hours. she could not help this wretched soul? Remember she is only at 13000 feet. While this may sound high it really is not. Conditions in a storm of the magnitude experienced that half week on denali are not fun but the situation is not like K@ or Everest where medical help and resupply may be an impossobility depending on ones altitude. THe height that Ms Koncour refers too is still well within range of airplane and helicopter support. What we learn from this book and Ms. Koncour is that if ever we are on a climbing team with her find another team you wont regret it. Based on rep alone i would not climb with her. ",1.0
" This book would be a joke if it were not dangerous. There's nothing wrong with being guided on a mountain...in fact it may be a comparatively safe way to enjoy an outdoor experience (and it keeps many climbers employed. There's also nothing wrong with writing about the experience of being guided...David Roberts Jon Krakauer and others have done that entertainingly and tastefully. But to title it 'the extreme...true courage...death-defying survival...a quest' shows serious signs of self-delusion. I am most concerned that some innocent will pick this book up enjoy it and do something really stupid.Hint",1.0
" I received a copy of this book as a gift and out of courtesy I read it despite misgivings spawned by the liner notes. In a poorly writen poorly edited poorly researched tribute to herself the author tries to describe the horrific ordeal she and her team mates (mostly her teammates on whom she was merciless in her criticisms) endured on Denali. They were 'trapped' at the 14200' camp on Denali in a severe storm that claimed 11 lives in May of 1992. The 14200' camp is as large as any k-Mart parking lot and just as flat. The idea of 'clinging' to the mountain from this camp is ridciulous. The camp had a ranger hut staffed by park service rangers and volunteers as well as a medical station. I am sure that their stay there was uncomfortablebut far from life threatening. The author attempts to exaggerate her own situation at the expense of those who were truly in danger on the mountain and those who died there. Her attraction to a body bag containing the remains of a man who died at the 14200' camp (of natural causes) was ghoulish and nauseating. She put me in mind of the rear echelon soldier who presents second hand stories of the horrors of war as his own. The author claims that on 'the mountain' the other climbers called her 'The Woman'. I would venture to guess that her team mates called her a lot of other things as well. In summary the Author attempted to portray a professionally guided climb on the easiest busiest route on Mt. McKinley as something much more than it was and did so at the expense of others. *Note to the editor* Orizabo is not the second highest peak in North America. Mt. Logan is much higher and far more difficult. Talkeetna is about 70 miles from Denali not 250 as stated over and over in the book ",1.0
" One unfortunate outgrowth of the success of excellent climber/writers such as Jon Krakauer Greg Child and Bill Sherwonit is the publication of books such as Facing the Extreme which seek to capitalize on the sudden interest in human suffering in the mountains. Facing the Extreme by Ruth Anne Kocour and Michael Hodgson is filled with many seemingly small factual errors which in the end add up and made me question Ms. Kocour's journalistic credibility (though she is not a journalist by trade it is still her responsiblity as an author to get it right). Though not a factual error in the Author's Note Ms. Kocour tells us that she has changed the names of her fellow climbers (with the exception of the guides) as she cannot '...speak for them or tell their story'. What she dosen't come right out and tell you is that her portrayal of her fellow climbers is focused almost entirely on both their personal and mountaineering shortfalls. If we are to believe Ms. Kocour she was the toughest mentally and physically the most skilled and the person with the fewest personality shortcomings. After elevating herself she clearly had no choice but to change the names of her fellow climbers. My biggest problem with Facing the Extreme comes with the obvious lack of fact checking. Ms. Kocour states that Talkeetna is 70 miles from Anchorage when it is approximately 114 miles. She also tells us that Denali is 250 miles from Talkeetna and the single engine Cessna made the flight to Denali Base Camp in 40 minutes an obvious impossiblity. Denali is actually only 60 miles by road from Talkeetna. In addition there are serious climbing factual errors as well all the more shocking considering Ms. Kocour's oft repeated (in the text anyway) expertise. Ms. Kocour claims that while camped at high camp at 17200 feet the climbers had now entered the 'death zone'. Actually the 'death zone' as it is known to climbers begins at approximately 26000 feet nearly 9000 feet higher than high camp on Denali. In fact Base Camp on Mount Everest where climbers spend close to 2 months at a time is at approximately 17700 feet some 500 feet higher that high camp on Denali. Ms. Kocour also states that she '...had been to 23000 feet on Aconcagua' difficult to do since Aconcagua is 22841 feet high a seemingly small error but an important distiction to climbers. If you want to spend money reading books by female climbers/explorers I suggest The Climb of my Life by Laura Evans or Artic Daughter by Jean Aspen. ",1.0
" I really wanted to like this book. Most climbing accounts are written by superstars of the sport. Ms. Kocour's book held promise of an honest account of an amateur 'weekend warrior'. The struggle of a group of amateur climbers thrown together to climb Denali has all the elements of a superb human drama. Unfortunately the depiction of the human spirit is perhaps the Mt. Everest of writing and Ms. Kocour is not an Everest climber - in either the mountaineering or the literary sense. Her character development is one-dimensional at best. The guides are all-wise guardian angels whose cosmic connection to the mountain is boringly infallible. Her fellow clients are either hapless bumblers or selfish dolts who would run off in panic were it not for the heroic presence of the author. Ms. Kocour's dialogue is downright silly. She apparently equates crudity with authenticity which perhaps accounts for her preoccupation with the many ways to defecate and urinate on the mountain. Upon her deliverance off the mountain she gushes to her guide 'You did a great job of leading - a tribute to your family's storied mountaineering and guiding history'. Do you think she really said that? Do you talk that way? Ms. Kocour compounds the problem by trying to portray her trip (and her role in it) as an astonishing mountaineering feat which it was not. Sure there was a bad storm but while Ms. Kocour was spending several chapters admiring her own ability to sit in the tent waiting for her guides to cook her dinner Park Service rangers and mountain rescue personnel were out in the teeth of the storm working to help climbers. Their presence is barely acknowledged. Climbing Denali on a guided trip is a tremendous physical and mental challenge and Ms. Kocour is right to be proud of it. However her trip should not be confused with a right of passage to 'serious' mountaineering. Any reasonably fit individual with three weeks and a few thousand dollars can sign on with any one of several excellent guide services to be led up the West Buttress of Denali. Hundreds of people do it every year. Ms. Kocour's very accomplished guides told the clients when to get up what to carry what direction to go and where to camp. The customers including Ms. Kocour followed their guide every day tied in line to a rope. To assert as Kocour does that being led up the West Buttress of Denali along with two or three hundred other people qualifies her to climb Everest is the sort of hubris that has contributed to so many deaths on that mountain. All in all this is just a bad book. It could have been the story of an individual's triumph over her own limits. Instead it was a tiresome tribute by the author to herself. Were it not for the mass market success of Jon Krakauer's Everest account this book would have been rightly relegated to the bargain bin. I won't even start on the editing ",1.0

" I hate when historical dramatizations treat facts in so frivolously fictitious a fashion that one ends up wondering why the thing was ever made. Why invent when any given reality is ever so more precious?I don't know all that much about Brummell (and learned very little about him in this flick) but I do about Byron. To perfidiously suggest that Lord Byron played a large part in bringing Brummell down is what is truly scandalous in this silly telling. Scrope Davis Byron's life-long friend was a crony of Brummell's - but Byron's interplay with Brummell is marginal if even that. Yet even beyond the slanderous suggestions of Byron's dissolute and desultory effects on this biopic's supposedly charming hero there is the matter of Matthew Rhys attempting to step into Byron's boots one of which was fashioned for a lame leg. Simply put if the historical Lord Byron was anything at all like the one portrayed in this film no women would have swooned and fainted when he entered a room (and if they had it would have been out of fright!) nor would they have scrambled across continents to 'unphilosophize' him. Unlike the actual Byron who was according to one of his innumerable lovers famously judged 'mad bad and dangerous to know' - Rhys is well just 'bad.' And NOT in a 'good' way! It hardly helps matters that he looks more like a cross twixt the young Steven Spielberg and the young Barbra Streisand than one of the most beautiful faces of the day.But apart from Byron if one knew hardly anything whatsoever about Beau Brummel about a quarter way in one might be wondering why in the world they were watching this film. It is minimal to an excessive degree. And apart from the Spartan script there is a truly threadbare feel to this entire undertaking. The whole story is alloted a few cramped sets - and no sense of the true style of the era is conveyed. I also understand that the modernistic music score is supposed to hint at Brummell's futuristic sense of style and all ('the dashing designer of modern dress - and disgrace') it says on the DVD cover - yet the music isn't great - it merely grates. And even though people came from far and wide to watch our fashion-plate hero dress I highly doubt if he permitted them to watch him attire himself from a ballsy state of complete nudity.In short I wasted money on this one money I could have placed on a number at the nearest gaming table.

I wanted to know how people reacted to his darker colors and simpler masculine less-effeminate style. How long did it take to change men's fashion? Brummell made a courageous statement in fashion and yet there was no grandiose cinematic show of it. There was one scene where gentlemen came to watch him dress but there was little explanation as to why they would waste their time. Wigs and perfume were all used to mask the lack of bathing and yet there was no significant statement of the change Brummell enacted. How did he convince men to bathe more often and how did he influence the importance of personal hygiene for both men and women? There was more to be told of the story and the movie failed. ",1.0

" This pocket size book attempts to teach the reader basic phrases and sentences in Danish by printing them phonetically in English. This is a great concept- but instead of spelling things foe-net-ik-lee they use all of those annoying symbols that one generally finds in a pronunciation key at the begining of an american dictionary (the upside down and backwards e the little lines over an a or an e etc. for example). So unless you are an English major and understand the meaning of these american language symbols- you will never understand this book. Also even when you try to figure out what all the symbols mean- the pronunciation that you end up with sounds nothing like the danish word. My husband is from Denmark and I have been struggling with the language for years. I suggest that you get Colloqial Danish with the audio tapes if you don't know anyone who can demonstrate the pronunciation for you. ",1.0

It seems as if the writers were really inspired and concentrated on what the text means more than how the text is presented.Don't forget the fact that since the books were written by different authors there are many plot holes that make the story very hard to understand and will leave you saying 'But why...'.

" First off my opinion comes from a musicians veiw.I began listening to At the drive in when they hit the scene in the mid 90s....i was turned on by their weird time changes and aggersive vocals. When the band broke up i was upset and i felt that the void would not be filled. When i heard Omar was fronting The mars volta i knew he would stay true to experimental music and indeed i was correct.I can not say the same for Sparta how ever i find that Cedric's vocals are often flat and they sound more like an unexperienced singer. Their music falls short maybe more production could be used to beef up the songs. I find comparing the mars volta to sparta an unfair comparision. The songs in general are caught up trying to be punk when they sound more like un inpsired emo tunes.......i guess maybe they are trying to hard to please......have you seen the videos! ",1.0

" Okay....with the break up of ATDI It is pretty obvious that all the talent went to The Mars Volta. These guys don't suck. They are just boring. They sound like every other band I have heard before that is out there making music with no uniqueness really. People think just because they can play an instrument that they can get a deal and start a band. This is what Sparta did just like all the other 500 bands in the industry who all sound exactly alike. The MArs Volta has tried new things and these new things have separated them from the 500 other bands. Like Tool Led Zepplin Pink Floyd And Queen...Mars Volta tried something different which has gained them a great amount of respect. Sparta? I can name a million other bands similar. ",1.0
" Of the two bands that ATDI splintered into it should be obvious at this point which one is actually worth listening to. The Mars Volta makes intelligent frenetic insane polyrythmic guitar-prog music while Sparta have found their niche in the world of tepid whiney radio rock.There's nothing interesting about this album. There are songs that are slightly catchy but nothing well written or particularly original. Even the cover looks stupid. Waste your money elsewhere. ",1.0
" If you're looking for a true 'collection' of some funny Stooge moments it's best to buy the Sony pictures chronological series. This 'collectors' edition' contains the same old shorts and other material you've probably seen countless times.That's not to say the four included shorts aren't funny (in fact 'Brideless Groom' with Shemp as the lead character and Malice in the Palace also with Shemp are both probably in my top five favorites) it's just that this set leads one into thinking they're getting some real gems here and not just the old public domain stuff we've seen for years and that we could get cheaper at any dollar store.One version of this 'collectors' edition' from Madacy is packaged in a fancy-looking tin lunch box with a whoopie cushion inside like that's going to fool anyone into thinking you're not just getting Brideless Groom Sing a Song of Six Pants Malice in the Palace and Disorder in the Court again along with the same old unfunny animated cartoons from the 60s and live-action segments with the almost aggressively unfunny Curly Joe DeRita. Those live action segments are only worth it to see Larry and Moe and also Emil Sitka from time to time but it's best to just tune out Curly Joe. Talk about sucking the air out of a room.In summary four public domain shorts and a small batch of unwatchable animated cartoons and some obvious filler do not justify this release's claim to being a collectors' set nor does the actual product you're getting merit its fancy packaging. To claim that this is a '75th anniversary collection' is an absolute insult to the stooges.Also the Curly impersonator who intros some of the fluff material needs to shut up already. ",1.0

First off like every other reviewer mentions these guys want to be the Beastie Boys so bad but believe me friends these guys can't even hold a candle to the Beastie Boys. This whole CD is dreadfully boring and now 'Stick Em Up' is starting to sound just a little to manufactured. Nothing caught my ear on this CD I was just so bored.

The only thing that made this CD worth it was 'tarfur.' it's supposedly the first rap song written entirely in Icelandic.

It will entirely pollute that part of your mind that the book developes so delicately and will leave you feeling deeply frustrated and disappointed. Worse still though if you see the film before reading the book you will be driven from the subject entirely too repulsed to give the book a chance not to mention the topic in general. The 'visitors' themselves represent a new low in film effects and appear to be at best discount inflatable puppets motivated by discarded animatronics. In total I feel an urgent sense that this film does a terrible disservice to Whitley Streiber shifting the story of his experience from a place of thoughtful contemplation into the realm of the comically yet absolutely disregardable.

And what's with the cover of Deep Purple's Space Truckin? The guitar tones are weak the drummer doesn't seem like he knows what he's doing and the song writing is just plain BAD.

" Plan 9 from Outer Spacewas an Oscar-winning performance compared to this dread of Hollywood. Actually I'm a gigantic fan of 'Plan 9' but I could find nothing whatever here to whet my usual fancy for almost all of the older black-and-white horror films.From the opening credits (which was reminiscent of some minor reprobate holding a cheesily scribed piece of poster board because it sort of 'moves around') I sensed that this one wasn't going to make my Hit Parade. Then in the very first scene the viewer is hilariously treated to a gal (who was ugly enough prior to make-up) who's wearing a pair of those paraffin buck teeth that we use to buy at the candy store back in the 50s for a nickel punctuated with the furry eyebrows of mouse-hair rivaling those of Martin Scorcese on a bad hair day.The devastating uppercut came with a performance by Page Cavanaugh and His Trio which the director clearly viewed as a big plus for his film. I'm inclined to not share his enthusiasm for that threesome of un-renowned musical geeks.I realize that this is 'troubled youth in the '50s Drive-in' fare and the movie should be viewed tongue-in-cheek... but an aardvark doesn't have enough tongue for this one.

" Alright folks. This is one of those films. Adjust the rating depending on your preference. If your looking for a GOOD Horror movie than apply the one star review. If your a masochist and/or a bad film nut than give this a full five star review!Frankenstein's Daughter(1958) was the brain child of Director Richard Cunhaa director who could have given Ed Wood a run for his money as he directed some of the most hilariously awful Horror pictures of the 1950s including She Demons(1957) Giant From the Unknown(1957) and Missle to the Moon(1958).The idea for this film must have sprang from the idea that since Frankenstein already had a son(Universal's 1939 'Son of Frankenstein' which was a GOOD film) why not make a film about his daughter? Well Cunha and his writers made the same age old mistake of confusing the doctor's name with the Monsters'. So instead of a Crazy foxy female scientist we get what is supposed to be the female Monster of yet another insane male scientist in the family.This Frankenstein is played by Donald Murphy in one of the hammiest mad scientist roles of all time. Murphy's Frankenstein is a lecherous megalomaniac creep who likes to hit on young hot jail bait which he either drugs them with a serum that makes there faces look like a bad halloween mask or run over them with his car which after there curvy voluptous figures are magically transformed to resemble that of a muscle bound man!Murphy plays the role to the hilt and it's a shame that his supporting cast does not share the same enthusiasm.John Ashley does his best Wooden Indian impression as a hapless boyfriend of Sandra Knightwho is equally bad. Knight only amuses when popping out of her tight black bathing suit. Veteran actor Felix Locher may have been the worst elderly actor of the period hamming it up to a degree that would shame even Murphy's eye rolling!This film features many of the most unintentionally funny moments in genre history including the horrendous make-up designed for the Monster which according to Hollywood Legend WAS supposed to be a sexy female Monster but instead(and quite improbally) became hulking actor Harry Wilson(!) who is not remotely attractive and/or female.Sandra Knight is briefly turned into a oatmeal faced Monster who runs around with her bathing suit on(!) causing a newspaper headline to describe a 'Bathing suited Monster on the Loose!'.The death scenes are CLASSIC bad cinema including some guy that gets crushed in a door(what is he shouting before the Monster crushes him? Is it 'Ma!'?) and the admittebly violent demise of Murphy's character who gets gruesomely scalded with acid by the worst miss in Hollywood history courtesy of Non-Hero John Ashley.I should probally also note that Harold Lloyd Jr. is in this film singing a very bad song and telling some terrible jokes not quite on par with his gifted father.And with that noteplease proceed at your own risk Movie Maniacs and enjoy this stinking piece of Trash cinema from the Golden age of the Drive In Movie.

" 'The Story of a Man of Character' as described by Thomas Hardy is somewhat flaccidly applied to this novel. In fact a better description of this novel comes from a colleague of mine Professor Neale Scott of the Baltimore University who remarked 'I realise now I had mistaken the dullness of Henchard's character for the dullness of the whole novel.'. Ultimately Prof. Scott is quite accurate in his assessment of the text. The characters bumble around waiting for circumstance to attach itself to their groins and do very little of plausible importance at all. Henchard himself is without doubt one of the most irritating characters to be placed in 'classic' fiction and one can't help but wish that the death of our tragic hero had happened an awful lot sooner such as before the novel started. The character of Elizabeth-Jane wonderfully parodied by Helli Kitchin of the Moscow State University is so blase towards her constantly changing parenthood that it completely ruins any sense of empathy that the audience may have for her. The least convincing Scotsman ever can also be found in this text in the form of Donald Farfrae and I am inclined to agree with Dr Daniel Greenfeld whose thesis 'Hardy makes the heart grow colder' points out that the author would not know a Scotsman if one jumped up and bit him a way that most of us admittedly meet them. To sum up - I discourage my students from reading this shambolic text. Avoid this novel like the plague - it is so soggy you couldn't even burn it to stay warm. Attempt perhaps to read something a little more plausible with something other that a praetorian wanderer and an intransigent hay-trusser to tantalise the imagination something that the author was obviously lacking - Wessex indeed.

" Modern novels can be so pretentious with their needless philosophizing and conscious experimentation with the language. So isn't nice to read a classic novel with straight-forward writing that aims for no insight into society or people? Actually no it's kind of depressing. The Mayor of Casterbridge relies on coincidence melodrama and as the afterword in my edition puts it 'the constant exploitation of chance happenings to determine situation and hence the fate of his characters.' I chose this Hardy novel because it was supposed to be character-centered. The story starts with Michael Henchard selling his wife and child at a fair. I thought this book would examine his redemption it would be a Lord Jim type tale of profound psychological insight. A strange event like that is a good way to get a book started but the crazy unlikely events just keep a-coming. You feel nothing for the characters ever. You learn nothing in the end except life is cruel and if something can go wrong it will. Read something else. ",1.0

As a veterinarian and graduate of The Ohio State University College of Food Agriculture and Environmental Sciences I can testify that the quality of such 'natural' products is often much lower than their farm-grown counterparts. Furthermore the agricultural processes decried by this author in fact serve to make our food supply safer than ever before. Certainly this book does not present an 'expert' opinion nor does it provide safe and accurate information for the women who need it most. As far as the rest of the information in this book I found it outdated and in other cases inaccurate. The author apparently has never been through a twin pregnancy herself; she is not particularly sensitive to the emotions of the mothers for whom the book is ostensibly written. ",1.0
" This book was originally written in 1980 and although a few chapters were added in 1991 it still reads like the early 80s - a time when a woman really could 'fail' childbirth! If you are looking for an excuse to gain 50-60 (or even 70!) lbs or an excuse to never drink another glass of milk (according to the author the idea that milk is good for you is just a myth propagated by the highly government subsidized dairy farmers) then this book could be for you. On the other hand if you're on bedrest considering using an epidural or even (gasp) a c-section this book will try to make you feel bad about it.Then there are the chapters about the long term psychological effect of having to share a womb. If you believe as the author does that you can remember back to the day you implanted as a little embryo in your mothers womb then you might think there's something to this. I just had to laugh.The author cites a lot of conflicting studies about twins and draws whatever conclusions she wants from them. All in all I didn't get any of the practical advise I was looking for. ",1.0
" I've read most of this book and the more I've read the more bizarre it is. Noble claims that hypertension anemia and gestational diabetes are natural aspects of pregnancy that can be harmful if treated. She says bedrest is actually harmful that ultrasounds increase fetal mortality and left-handedness (???) and a host of other claims. She implies that those carrying multiples many years ago gave birth to healthy 7-lb each infants with none of the problems that some of us having multiples face today. She is an advocate for veganism water births home births doulas and midwives and avoiding pain meds. Though my twins are big and healthy I certainly didn't take the advice in this book.This is not medically sound advice nor is it objective or open-minded. It is a book of extreme views. ",1.0
" This was the scariest book on twins that I read. If you want to be afraid to eat sleep or breathe during your entire pregnancy than this is your kind of book. Almost every chapter focuses on a negative aspect of carrying more than one baby and there are more chapters on what can go wrong than what to do to help things go right. ",1.0
" Having just been told I was expecting twins I was keen to find a book that could give me the information and reassurance that standard 'singleton' pregnancy books could not. But instead of finding useful information and reassurance I finished this book feeling anxious and alarmed. It focuses far too much on the negative aspects of having twins - loss of one twin preterm labor birth complications vanishing twin syndrome etc. It is daunting enough being pregnant with twins without reading a book that reminds me of all the things that can go wrong. In addition the author offers impractical advice on nutrition and exercise which in many cases is contrary to advice from the medical profession. Not everyone has the money or the desire to eat seaweed and other 'macrobiotic' health store food. All in all I would not recommend this book to any woman expecting twins. It is alarmist and out-of-touch with real pregnant women. ",1.0
" I read this book right after I found out that I was having twins. Although I was a little concerned about the financial aspects of having two children I was very positive about having twins. This book absolutely scared me! Doom gloom and more doom! After reading it I thought that I would end up on bedrest early that my twins would end up in NICU for months and that all sorts of problems would come up. My husband and I later attended a childbirth class for multiple births and one of the first things that the instructor told us was to NOT read this book. There are so many other books out there that do tell you the risks and the problems but manage to stay positive. Incidentally I never was put on bedrest my girls were born at 36 weeks they spent one night in NICU and came home with me three days later. Believe me from talking to other moms of twins and my own experiences this is much more common than this book would make you believe. ",1.0
" I read this book while I was pregnant with my twin daughters and found it incredibly depressing and scary. It was filled with morbid quotes from parents who had a bad outcome along the lines of 'when not even one of the triplets lived I went out and got drunk' and seemed to dwell on every possible problem and complication to the point that I was quite stressed and anxious when in fact my twins were born naturally five days before the predicted due date had none of the complications this horrible book made me worry about and were in excellent health. In fact I so dislike the book that I go out of my way to warn expectant parents of twins to avoid it. In addition the dietary advice is ridiculous and it's impossible for even a hearty eater to consume the massive amounts of food this writer claims are necessary to having a healthy baby. So unless you like being scared I recommend against buying this book. ",1.0
" I was looking for a comprehensive layman terms guide that I can refer to in anticipation of the birth of my twins. This books wasn't it. Its seems as if the author forgot her audience parents that do not have time to completely comprehend each and every detailed paragraph of a page. Extremely busy/expectant/multitasking parents are the norm - they are looking for bite sized data that they can learn from - quickly. Hoping this author takes to heart this feedback and revisits what could be a valuable resource. ",1.0

" I purchased an Under Armour compression tee at a local store in a size Large. The shirt fit fantastic. I wanted a back up so I purchased this one online size Large different color. The shirt arrives on time open the package and it is a Large but does not even fit over my shoulders.... I contacted the vendor for an exchange. They do not do exchanges but will allow me to return the shirt. If the shirt was worn it has to be washed before returning it... no problem for I could not get the shirt on anyway so tags etc were all in place. If you pass 30 days there is a restocking fee of 20% which I was unaware of.When I questioned the vendor why I have a Large and ordered the same size it did not fit. The vendor stated that Under Armour has different sizing charts for different shirts. That just did not make sense. How are you to buy a product with 'floating' sizes.So I went online to Nordstrum to find the same exact heat guard compression tee. There was a size chart that could be pulled up to check size before ordering.... only 1 chart for Under Armour. I did all the measurements correctly to find that I was to order a Large.I know the shirt fits tight but since I already HAD a large that fits and the chart from Under Armor at Nordstrum confirmed that I had ordered the correct shirt size the statement that there are different size charts for different Under Armour shirts ' just doesn't fit!'.I personally will visit a store and actually try it on to avoid the hassle and disappointment of waiting for a product that does not fit seemingly was ordered correctly and then had to be mailed back.

" On their first three albums the Soft Machine were one of the real gems of the psychedelic and then progressive rock scene. Whereas far too many psychedelic bands tried to make it with vocalists who were quite unsuited to the sounds which they were aiming to make and many progressive bands could never play in such a manner as to attract attention the Soft Machine never fell prey to any of those problems. Their music always had a deep feeling to it and the vocals of Robert Wyatt and Kevin Ayers were always truly touching and at times even funny.OnThird the band with a new lineup changed tack completely but to no less effect on three of the sides. In doing so they provided part of the blueprint for such movements as the 1990s post-rock sound with fierce bass work and the unique saxophone playing of Elton Dean.However on the second side 'Slightly All the Time' there was some suggestion that the Soft Machine could lose the plot - and on 'Fourth' and 'Fifth' it is no understatement to say that they did so in a more dramatic manner than could ever have been imagined. Gone is the touching drumming of Wyatt and the intense bass lines that carried so much of 'Third' and in their place are sounds that could have come from almost any jazz-rock band and have utterly no emotional impact let alone the capacity to make a listener want to listen repeatedly. Elton Dean's saxophone work is even more prominent than it was on 'Slightly All the Time' but lacks the balance Hugh Hopper's fierce bass playing provided so wonderfully on 'Facelift' and 'Out-Bloody-Rageous'.Worse still is how the music on 'Fourth' and 'Fifth' seems to drift through a listener as if it were the worst kind of elevator music played with very little interruption. The saxophone sound is also so typical of the worst kind of 1970s jazz-rock as to be distinctly dated.All up this is a case of a band seemingly losing everything in one step just asThird Ear Banddid around the same time with theMacBeth soundtrack. Stick with their first three albums. ",1.0

" Without a doubt this has to be most boring apocalyptic zombie horror book I have ever had the misfortune to read.The story starts off promising enough with an unknown virus which kills millions and nicely introdcues us to the characters but thats where it ends. The rest of the story is taken up with them finding somewhere to live and going out for supplies.The author does a good job of trying to convey the shock and disbelief of surviving such an event but it is overdone. 200 pages into a book I dont want the characters still sitting around in a state of shock.It seems as if David Moody started to write the first few chapters which evolved into a whole book but the early chapters never ended.At no point did I care about any of the characters because they were two dimensional. We learnt very little of their back stories so I never connected with them.Now onto the zombies OMG without doubt these are the most unscary monsters I have ever come across. They dont do anything but walk around and bumb into things. Its obvious that the trio are never really in danger from them. I also find it hard to believe that in todays world if you saw the dead rising and walking around the word zombie would not pop into your head but it seems as if the protagnists in the book are oblivious to the fact that these dead people are indeed zombies.Save your money and buy World War Z.

" Autumn isn't a zombie novel. That's something you'll have to figure out pretty quickly. Sure there are corpses that get up wander around and bump into things but that's really about all they do for over half the book. Instead the focus is on a group of three completely unlikable (and frankly hard to keep track of because they all talk exactly the same way) 'survivors' whose names I won't even bother mentioning.Essentially the premise is that a virus sweeps the world (I assume) randomly killing...well just about everyone. The few left (in the unidentified 'English' city this story takes place in about thirty people out of half a million are left unaffected) band together at a community center with flimsy walls (this exposition is set up rather ludicrously early on and there's not even a pay off) the dead start rising and people start to panic. Unfortunately it's really hard to figure out why everyone immediately goes into survival mode (people panic at the site of a mob of undead only to learn they've simply gotten themselves hung up on a parked car) since the zombies while obviously dead aren't initially any more deadly than the average pot head or dementia patient. They shuffle around and bump into things they freeze up whenever anyone touches them etc. The irrational level of fear people have for them would seem to indicate people have been watching BBC's midnight zombie flick marathon except no one ever seems to make the zombie connection (Moody apparently subscribes to the theory that zombie fiction is best when the word zombie never appears). While I don't really care what you call the undead (be it skels Deadites zombies Darkseekers or whatever) I at least a reason for everyone to be afraid of them.For over half of its over 300 page length we get a series of repetitive sequences that don't really move the plot along all the while mobile corpses (it seems to cheat the term to call them zombies or even undead) wander around in the shadows. True scenes of zombies in the distance do make for an eerie atmosphere (Resident Evil Apocalypse and Dawn of the Dead's far superior remake manage this beautifully) but since for most of Autumn that's all the dead even do it quickly stops being scary (at least for me if not the characters themselves) and starts just being loopy.Let's talk about the characters themselves. Autumn has quite a large cast of them all of whom Moody seems to feel duty bound to name but none of whom really matter. There are however three main survivors. One man has lost his wife and daughter (his only unique feature and one which Moody will keep pounding into us long after it gets old) another man (who I really can't remember anything at all about and I gave up on this book yesterday over 150 pages in) and a woman whose response to this nightmare at first was to simply crawl into bed pull up the covers and wish everything would go away. There are a host of tertiary characters as well such as the man in the first chapter who succumbs to the plague (since he never comes back as a zombie it seems rather pointless to have this scene at all since we get not one but about a dozen similar scenes through the eyes of our survivors) another man who starts off looking for a gas station and quickly reveals himself to be a massive prick two rather pointless old women two equally pointless young women (who both sob a lot) and several others who are fortunately only present briefly only to be eaten off screen when the extremely flimsy building they all stupidly took shelter in ('I can push the walls apart!' announces a main character rather pointlessly early on which terrifies the others for no reasons since there's no danger from outside at this point and is to foreshadowing what a three year-old's finger painting is to Monet). We knew this was going to happen the minute our three main characters left the only problems with the scene are how badly it's set up and the fact that it all occurs off page (including the aftermath) meaning we don't even get to see the results of the suddenly not friendly zombies as they devour everyone. This is frankly a shame since the long and plodding scenes leading up to this deserve SOME sort of pay-off but they really don't ever get any as is the case with this novel as a whole.It's hard to keep the characters straight mainly because they have such a narrow range of personality",1.0

Well at this point in the story the only fight for survival these three charecters have faced is driving around in a van. Nothing at this point has threatened them heck they haven't even run out of gas.

Maybe it was the large anticipation I had incorporated when purchasing the book thinking that post-apocalyptic scenarios were 'my kind of thing' (and they still are). However Moody's book was very poorly written. Not only did I encounter numerous grammatical mistakes but there was absolutely no connection with the characters. It was almost like 'here are the characters now you must try and relate to them and follow through with their overly obvious situations.' I felt no sympathy with Carl's death or any other middle school -written events that occurred. Overall this was a terrible book in the sense that there was no captivation whatsoever.

I expected things to pick up after Emma Mike and Carl struck out on their own but that didn't happen either.One of the best series I've read (zombie themed) was the 'As the World Dies' trilogy by RhiannonFrater. Those books were fast paced full of action and intrigue and the characters were interesting. Plus it also made you think about how mankind really WOULD react if some similar apocalypse occurred. I CARED about the characters in that story and immediately downloaded the second and third books in this series after reading the first. I WON'T be doing that with the 'Autumn' series. ",1.0
" I felt like I was reading the outline for the book and not the actual end result. Like if the author of the Dick and Jane series wrote a zombie story this is what it would be like. I kept on though despite the many many frustrating and confusing misprints typos and grammatical errors because I am in desperate need of zombie reading material. It was slow and annoying because the characters in the book seemed to all be like minded in the sense that there were always ONLY two options and never any more and the zombies don't cause any threat at all until like the last 3 chapters and even then the threat is minimal.Why read a zombie novel only to have the story based on the emotions of the characters and their incredibly uncreative brains and not the trails and thrills of survival in a dooms day like setting? I mean that's what draws me to zombie fiction in the first place... I assume I am not alone in this.All in all I was very disappointed with the story and hope for more books to come out like Justin Cronin's The Passage and the Max Brooks novel World War Z. Also if anyone happening to read this knows of more books similar to the ones I just put out there please do me a favor and comment on this review with the info as I am always interested in quality zombie reading material!",1.0

" I was dispointed with the size of the creamer and sugar bowl. I was given another set(like this set) 3 years ago by my daughter for a birthday gift she got it from the Betty Crocker web site. I was very please with it then as the bowl and creamer was a nice big size. as Betty Crocker no longer carries this line I was pleased to find the set on Amazon.com. the picture was exactly like the set that I have.However This creamer and bowl that came with this setlooks like it was made for a child's tea set they are so tiny neither one holds a halve cup of sugar or creamer. And the Sugar Bowl is oval not round as it was on the online picture. I was very dispointed- as I had planed on giving it as a wedding present to a frend's daughter(who had liked the set each time I used it). I ended up buying something else for her. Now the Butter dish and Gravy Boat are normal size and thats makes them look even more tiny. I'll never buy this again ",1.0

" I honestly fear for mankind after hearing this album. Even more so I worry about everyone who loves it so much. If you're finding absolutely anything about this album to be inspiring exceptional unique or even GOOD in the slightest (with one exception which I'll get to later) you obviously haven't heard nearly enough REAL music and obviously have been inducted into the Mindless Drones With Money to Burn Hall of Fame.Moby's formula is to take a sample loop it and add drums. He does this over and over again. There are no exceptions. For some reason people find this 'deep'.Some tracks are 'ambient'--otherwise known as 'narcoleptic'. When a song absolutely DOES NOT CHANGE for four minutes--and what's there to begin with is hardly exciting--it's left the realm of true ambient music and gone into sleep-inducing terrifyingly bad hype.As for the 'deeper meaning' behind this obvious attempt to [put] out yet another commercialized sellout record (not like he had any talent whatsoever to begin to sell out with) simply put--there is none! Where are people finding meaning and substance in 'why does my heart feel so bad' repeated over and over for 3 minutes? Where is the purpose and direction in 'gunnahunnagumbay'?The lone exception to this rule is the exceptional song 'everloving'--download that and enjoy because if you're looking for that kind of music you'll most likely hate the rest of the album.If you want to listen to real music that actually has substance unlike this amateur [stuff] listen to Delerium's album Karma... Enigma's Screen Behind the Mirror.... Amethystium's Aphelion.... Sorten Muld's III....There is so much good music out there--don't waste your time on this one. ",1.0

Moby has lot more work to do to get into the genre of Prodigy or Chemical Brothers. ",1.0
" As my title suggests I was a bit disappointed with 'Play.' Before I listened to it I had heard so much about Moby and was expecting a treat.The one song that really delivered was 'South Side.' Simply put it sounds great. It is catchy and upbeat and has great music. I loved this song. But the rest of the album isn't as skillfully made.Songs like 'Run On' 'Honey' 'Bodyrock' and 'Natural Blues' COULD have been great but are weighed down by excessive repetition. Eventually it gets to be too much and I don't even listen to those songs. Listen to the 30 second samples of those songs...and you have it all.And then to top it off there are those songs that are just completely horrible. I'm not sure if 'Down Slow' or 'Inside' can even be called songs. They don't really seem to have any sort of structure just a few minutes of drum machine beats and wavering background music. They are just no fun at all to listen to.Get 'South Side' off of iTunes and leave it at that. ",1.0

A rather intresting idea but it comes off as remarkably cheesy and not very catchy either.If self-help books came with musical accompinaments this is what they would sound like.

" I'll try to be even handed about this album. On one hand I accept it is very pleasing to the ear and has sold millions of copies. But does that make it a good album?To many people I'm sure it does but to me it doesn't. For in essence all Moby has done is taken samples of old blues tracks and placed a drumloop and some piano melodies underneath there's nothing good about that. In fact it's very very lazy.Now I do accept he has done it very well but that doesn't change my opinion. I'm not totally against sampling but he does it on nearly every track with no use of innovation then what's the point? At least DJ Shadow knows how to 'use' a sample.The way Moby has shamelessly sold the rights of every track on this album bar one to advertisers means also you have probably heard every track already therefore you may not need to purchase this 'recycled' album.Well of course it's upto you but I prefer the originals!

Pretty sad average if you ask me.That is of course unless you like listening to old blues and gospel remixed with a techno-feel.But I do have to give credit to his label for picking 'Bodyrock' as the first and so far only single to be released.

" First of all the rhythms of the album are not even remotely close to being compatible with dancing. And if any of them are you wouldn't want to dance to them anyway. After reading the introduction to my critique I'm sure the other 196 people that reviewed this album and gave it 5 stars are saying 'it's not about dancing...it brings out emotions' and a whole bunch of other hooey. Okay great...but stick it in another category like blues or gospel. This album has no business being the number 1 dance/dj pick whatsoever. How this album has anything to do with techno is beyond my understanding which is probably attributed to the fact that this album is NOT techno. I wouldn't even call it electronica. It's more of a fusion between blues and synth sounds in an attempt to reflect how depressed this person feels. If you're looking for emotional music in the genre of electronica I suggest CAFE DEL MAR VOL. 5 or UNDERWORLD which fits more in the realm of techno than MOBY does.Don't misinterpret my words.... I'm not saying this music isn't good. It's just that this isn't a dance/dj album...and it may mislead those of us who enjoy genuine techno house and trance. This is just a warning to anyone who finds this album being promoted in the techno section.I'm sure all of the other people that reviewed this album giving it five stars will mark the 'not helpful' circle on my critique as they did to the other people who gave this album a bad review.

" Another overrated record. Moby found some old blues recordings and slapped them on top of disco probably because they are in the public domain and he doesn't have to pay any royalties. Sure he's ripping off the man just like all the white boys of the past and all the kids will buy it not knowing where to find the real thing.

Any CD that during your third time listening to it you start skipping to the next track halfway through the song because you've HEARD ENOUGH OF THE SAME THING ALREADY needs to get dropped off at your nearest CD trading post ASAP.

" If you're expecting a book that details the authors in-depth experiences with Benedictine spirituality or a how-to book on retreats. Then this is not the book for you. This book should have been called 'The Cloister-Lite Walk'. And as a Catholic I found this book to be very offensive.This book centers on the happenings of the author's daily life with a sprinkling of her 'not-so much about' experiences with Benedictine spirituality where all of the chapters are laid out according to the Liturgical year (Saints days / feasts days).For Catholic's looking for some insight on Benedictine spirituality and retreats...be forewarned. This book is written by an author who claims to have returned to her Protestant roots and wants to share how Benedictine spirituality has had an influence on her life.But if you scratch past the surface of this you will find that contained in the book are stories of Benedictine religious who are not in the least faithful to the teachings of the Catholic church.For example on page 12 she speaks of a monk named David....'he purchased an amulet of a whale's fluke... The woman who sold it to him said it had been blessed by a Methodist bishop but he could also take it to a priest of the old religion. 'I did' he said. 'It cost me a six-pack of beer and a carton of cigarettes'You will also find ALOT of ANTI-CATHOLIC BIAS in this book. The author states that the writings of Saint Jerome cause modern women to think that 'women must be either virgins or whores either blessed or cursed while men are simply sexual athletes slaves of lust'. (page 24)Assumes that in the hospital where she was born that the nuns being who they are 'one of them may have baptized me in secret' (page 88) That celibacy in the Catholic church should show us how 'we need only look at newspaper accounts of sex abuse by priests to see that celibacy isn't working' (page 116).The author shows her true ignorance as to the origins of the sex abuse scandal. I recommend that readers get ahold of the book 'Goodbye Good Men' by Michael S. Rose which shows that celibacy is far from being the reason why the horrors of the abuse of children by priests occurred.The author then takes a much-loved Catholic saint 'Maria Goretti' and reduces her to nothing more than a virgin-patsy used by the Catholic Church just like Marilyn Monroe was by those she knew in her life and states that Maria Goretti 'in a curious way she reminds me of Marilyn Monroe' (page 223). On top of this she agrees with what was said in article on Maria Goretti that states 'that a woman was better dead than raped'.... And by canonizing her the church has seemed to many to agree.' (page 224)The author appears to think that it would have been better if Maria Gorretti allowed herself to be raped and shouldn't have defended her virginity. This kind of liberalism trying to pass as a book showing her respect towards Benedictine spirituality whilst at the same time throwing out her little anti-Catholic jabs is reason enough for any devoted Catholic to pass on this book.A final example of her anti-Catholicism is the chapter entitled 'Women and the Habit",1.0

" If anyone is actually looking for a true tale of the plight of California Indians don't bother to look at Jackson's novel.It is inherently racist written by a woman who doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same likes as Upton Sinclair or Harriet Beecher Stowe.On one of her visits to California Jackson called the Native Americans she saw 'loathsome abject and hideous.' In her novel she doesn't stray far from this inherent indignation of another race. In fact she most likely had no idea she was being racist another reason entirely why this book should be burned. ALternately thorughout the book Jackson refers to the indians Ramona and ALlesandro encounter as 'patient creatures' (16) 'poor creatures' (20) 'wild creatures' (47) 'faithful creatures' (353) 'miserable creatures' (324) 'vagabond bands' (286) 'like beasts' without the Christianizing presence of the Missions (231). are they human? possibly. are they equal to the pastoral spanish who enslaved them that Jackson venerates so much? most definitely not.Secondly ALlesandro could be the most anglicized Indian ever. He is most assurredly an abberation physically looked like a mexican was the most devout catholic lives in a house that is like any mexican villa. INdeed Jackson remarks that 'There were not many such Indians as Allesandro and his Father. If there had been it would have been better for their people' (327) and that he 'almost makes one forget he is an Indian.' (101).also she refuses to create an interracial love story. the whole crappy book is predicated on the fact that Ramona is half indian. only when she is indian can she fulfill Jackson's debased notion of racial determinism.Besides the myriad moral reasons why this book is so terrible it could be the most groandiose verbose and pooorly written romance book EVER. the characters lack any moral ambiguity which would make for interesting characterization and are constantly marked by sweeping romantic gestures that could better be classified as trash fiction than a literary classic.You'd find more entertainment from reading the yellow pages than wasting your time.

" I have no idea why this film is practically out of print & why it's so expensive when it's so indescribably awful. I also have no idea why so many people love this film. I purchased a copy of it recently to see what the hype was all about (e.g. the rumor floating around that it had a lot of sex in it & my parents forbidding my older sisters to see it in the '80's. This was surprising since my parents were pretty lenient in letting us watch almost every movie we wanted to when my sisters & I were growing up). To my dismay the sex scenes really didn't show that much. The only decent things I can say is that the cinematography is good (e.g. the orange lighting in the scenes where Jade (Brooke Shields) & David (Martin Hewitt) are making love. Martin Hewitt is great eye-candy for the female viewers in this film.The film's not even so bad it's good. I did recently watch 'I Love the '80's Strikes Back 1981' on VH-1 & was amused by how awful the stars on the show said it was & the jokes they made about it. The acting is awful by everybody & no one is really likable in the film. Jade's parents are morons. The father tries to be cool & smoke grass & drink alcohol with the kids. He usually ends up making a fool out of himself dancing around idiotically. Basically he's only nice when he's under the influence. Jade's mom struggles to sputter out easy sentences & sayings souding like a child learning Hooked on Phonics & is so sex-starved that she tries to pull an a la Graduate & make it with David. Jade's older brother (James Spader) is not happy with David dating Jade even though he introduced the two!Brooke Shields disturbs me in this film. I always got the feeling that she was exploited in this film (as she was in many others when she was young e.g. Pretty Baby as a 12-year-old prostitute The Blue Lagoon in which she's way too young to be wearing barely nothing & having sex) as some unstable young nymphomaniac who acts much younger than 15. This is especially evident in the rape scene that was so nauseating I had to fast forward past it. It's long after David has intentionally set fire to Jade & her family's house & they meet up again a couple of years later & he rapes her making her demand over & over again to proclaim his love to her & she's crying. Afterwards she's still on his bed acting flirty & nonchalant as if nothing happened. What a f@#%*# up scene!After the scene I just mentioned I kept on fast forwarding through the film to stop the madness & because I really didn't care what would happen. I just wanted it to end. Does it have a point? Maybe it does - that arson will not win back the heart of the girl you love? Or maybe that obsessive love will most likely & almost always lead to tragic consequences? But who really cares any way? I suggest you save your money & rent better films about obsessive love like the uncensored version of 9 1/2 Weeks & the 1st version of Romeo & Juliet. ",1.0
" I enjoyed Brooke Shields in The Blue Lagoon so I ordered a VHS copy of Endless Love to see more of her. This movie has a low-budget quality to it including grainy picture with poor sound. Others have laid out the plot and I agree with those who pointed out the weaknesses which made it difficult for me to watch all the way through. Sex and love can get confusing because before long a pair-bonding type of addiction occurs. Too bad this basic message gets lost in the crazy plot of this chick flick.My experience of dating the girl next door (both of us previously married) is one example of the addictive nature of a sexual relationship",1.0

" This film is inconsistent in many ways. Set up as a forbidden love story between two teen agers bitterly opposed by the father of the girl the film stops making sense that you realize that the girl's family is supposed to be a bunch of progressive ex-hippies who encourage their children to experiment and hold wildest parties on the block. Why hate the kid when he is trying so desperately to become part of the clan? The enemy number two is the girl's brother who happens to be this guy's best friend who introduced him to his sister in the first place!Beyond that the film starts falling apart. Father forbids them to see each other for a month because of the girl's failing grades and the kid goes bonkers and sets the house on fire. The obvious question is why aren't they talking in school and what sort of friendship is it that can't survive a thirty day separation? Unless the guy is obssessed with the girl and the girl is not interested.Whatever merits the original novel had got lost in this screen adaptation. No reason for the attraction is given nor does the film show any relationship between the two beyond sexual attraction. The girl's folks are not at all recognizable as former hippies but you can definitely see traces of old world aristocracy in them with the duck hunting and with pretensions to preppiness and upper classdom why then did they introduce the kid to the girl in the first place by a jealous brother no less???Finally the film disgisted me because the guy is clearly a stalker and the girl is objectified and the whole affair is shown as GREAT LOVE! On a couple of occasions the guy forces himself on the unwilling girl and they explode into passionate lovemaking. In the final analysis the message in the film validates every stalker in that the object of their obssession will yield to them in the end if only they get through to her against all odds and against all reason. Except in this story the stalker is the hero and a victim. ",1.0
" You have to be kidding! Maybe endless therapy is a more telling title!Though the book was an international bestseller the movie is only a shadow of what Scott Spencer wrote. Endless Love had the potential to be another Love Story but Franco Zeffirelli didn't pull it off. Perhaps the passage of time makes the film seem shallow and morbid in its sappiness but what comes out on the screen is two love-crazed teenagers driven to distraction. A 15-year-old girl is best off forging a solid core identity and not having emotional turbulence that young romantic love provokes. A 17-year-old boy about to graduate high school should be looking towards his future. The parents are as much to blame in the story line for their lack of guidance and misunderstanding about the overwhelming feelings teenage hormones have on adolescent minds.If you like sappy romance without the strength of acting dialogue and a decent story.... Endless Love is your tale. Otherwise ... just get over it. There are better told tales of the heart out there.Suggestions",1.0
" This CD does not come close to recapturing the spirit of The Box Tops in the 60's. Of the 14 songs on this CD only two are worth listening to. Alex Chilton has lost the distinct tones that were prevelent in his voice in his youth. As you can tell I was highly disappointed in this CD. ",1.0

" Watching t.v. late at night (or too early in the morning)? 'Doppelganger' might be just the right b-movie to keep you occupied. It's interesting enough to make you wonder what exactly is going on but cheesey enough towards the end to make you understand exactly why it's played at 3 in the morning. George Newbern is the best feature of the movie fine acting and seems to be too good for the movie itself. Drew Barrymore(we all know how much she has improved since 'Doppelganger'and I personally think she is a great actress. That having been said-)leaves so very much to be desired. She has an awkward deliverence of her lines but most of the fault I suspect lies in the story itself. The movie appears to be getting good by the middle by falls short at the end. Almost as if it was given to two different writers to finish and neither ending was cut. Overall worth watching for a thrill a laugh or Newbern's acting. ",1.0
" I enjoy movies with Drew Barrymore but this movie must have had the lowest budget ever! Through most of the movie you are not sure of the outcome.

The plot or what little there is is the story of a retarded boy who was burnt to death two years ago at Camp Paradise and has been summoned up from the dead by his sister to kill all her friends who she felt were responsible for her brother's death. Sound familiar? This film is so incredibly bad that when I watched it with two of my cousins we cried laughing so hard. This is one of the cheapest (if the not the cheapest) slasher flick of all time. It's the first movie that I've ever seen that has a full grown man screaming like a small toddler girl! Also why is this movie so incredibly 80's as compared to other slasher movies? Everyone has a mullet or some kind of bad hair and they all drive the same beat-up car! Excellent for a stomach-contracting laugh but terrible for a decent scare. ",1.0

The first one was strangely compelling and I found the second one on sale cheap but I should have honestly stopped there.There is nothing really scary about these 'bodies.'

Eventually efforts at getting rid of them would pay off.There is nothing scary about this book that is except the hypnotic repetitiveness of the narration. If I read one more time the long drawn-out explanation of why the bodies were amassing near the survivors I think perhaps I might have turned into a zombie-like creature myself.I remain flabbergasted that so many people appear to have thought this book was worth 4+ stars.

The addition of walk-on parts for Bob Dylan and Gerald Ford only makes it more unreal. Nor to I need an unbelievable series of disasters from sink holes to collapsing houses to freeway kidnaps to a Los Angeles firestorm to try to inject some plot into this unfocused story.

" I must agree with Schroedinger that this is a poorly written book. It seems that novices who've only seen one or two quantum physics texts in their lives fall for the smooth talking style of Griffiths. Don't fall for it! For example the section on angular momentum and spin is one of the worst I've ever read. Griffiths gets the reader lost in a heap of math without taking the time to describe the picture behind it. (I'm not complaining about the level of math in the book but his failure in communicating the physical insight or feeling of quantum phenomena.)Even the small book by Paul Davies is better written and more insightful than Griffiths.My personal recommendations are the Feynman Lectures on Physics (volume III) and Introduction to the Quantum Theory by David Park (even Griffiths acknowledges in his own text that Park is an excellent book). After these two you may want to hit Shankar or Sakurai. (As I said above the book by Davies is pretty good too.) ",1.0
" This is the worst book I have ever used throughout college. A person who has not had Quantum Mechanics would not understand it by using this book.

This book needs to be discontinued! ",1.0
" This text is much like Griffith's intro to electrodynamics. If you don't need to learn anything and just want a simple answer to basic questions buy this book. If however you are taking a class in quantum mechanics don't waste your money. Griffith brings up interesting questions without ever answering them. He offers no assistance in solving the more demanding problems which would aid the learning process. If you're majoring in physics stay away from Griffith as a whole. Rholf is a much better publisher and writer. Check out his texts if you're serious about an education. ",1.0
" I can't understand why Mr. Griffiths' undergraduate physics books are so popular. The low intellectual level of his writing can only discourage more advanced students yet the physics is so watered down that you won't learn much anyways. His books read like a 'Physics For Dummies' series.Griffiths' Quantum Mechanics book continues in this tradition. He introduces Schroedinger's Equation on the FIRST page without giving any of the traditional 'plausibility arguments'. He bypasses any discussion of the Old Quantum Theory (Bohr's Correspondence Principle and the Bohr-Summerfeld quantization conditions). He gives a watered down introduction to the Dirac formalism which fails to adequately explain Dirac's measurement theory and such important concepts as simultaneous eigenkets and non-commuting observables.There are innumerable superior QM books at the undergraduate level. Save your money and forget about Griffiths. ",1.0

We do not get to know what makes Giovanni 'tick' he is not well drawn and what motivates him. Feehan spent so much time trying to make the castle a dark scarry place that it was overkill. Nicolette the villiage healer is picked as the bride for the local and powerful Don Giovanniwho is cursed after she heals his neice. He persues her and seems to speak to her with special powers that scare her even though she has her own special healing powers. Nicolette goes from being a superstitious weak scardy cat to not caring at all and doing as she pleases. Giovanni pushes the wedding ahead not wanting to wait to take her. He goes from extremely controlling to being very caring and gentle. Giovanni does not care that he takes her from what she loves or what is important to Nicolette as long as she does what he tells her to do. Nicolette finally figures out that the family 'curse' for the Scarlettis is from a family member and frees Giovanni from the curse. I do not recommend the book it was a disappointment to me. The writter spent to much time using words to describe the landscape and the buildings and the rooms and I don't remember what all else and she did not develope her characters. ",2.0

" The Premise for this book follows the old gothic format. Heroine goes into spooky house - falls for tortured hero - danger lurks around every corner. I used to love this type of romance but this one was extremely annoying! The plot was good the hero and heroine were a good match but I could not get past all the breaks in the sentences to inclue a couple of Italian words. It seemed that Ms. Feehan tried too hard to add that touch of Italian to every other sentence by putting in the two Italian words for my bother my mother my father my grandfather my grandmother. It was down right annoying to keep reading these few sets of words so frequently. It was very hard to keep the pace of reading the book when the sentences were broken up so often with the Italian. I have been a romance reading for over 20 years and have frequetnly read romance with touches of another language thrown in here and there but this one was just to choppy for me to enjoy. I don't think I'll be inclined to buy another Feehan gothic unless I get the chance to skim it first. I will however keep reading her Dark series which I absolutely love. ",2.0
" It's difficult to understand all the 5-star reviews this album has gotten. The production is excellent and the performances immaculate but the music is cheesy and lacks soul.

Though it was a commercial success and I'm glad for their good fortune because of it (being from Seattle I have a soft spot for this great band) it is among the least of their albums.

To bring this up to date the more recent Heart -Jupiter's Darling Red Velvet Car and FANATIC far faaaaar surpass this dated 80's hair pop. My disappointment came from the fact that listening to the 'Heart' album I could tell that Ann and Nancy were no longer at the wheel. The 80's material was a money making enterprise not Heart making a great album. With the exception of Ann's voice there was simply nothing of 'Heart' left in the music. It was like listening to Toscanini leading a harmonica band. After they got out from under the thumb of Capitol they began to produce 'Heart' music again. Masterful writing Ann's soaring vocals Nancy doing things to an acoustic guitar that shouldn't even be possible. In short order Ann and Nancy are back at the wheel. And it really shows.

" To me this was the beginning of the end for the Wilson sisters. Sure there are some okay songs on here or so I thought until I recently replaced my vinyl LP with the CD. These songs sound so dated that I can't believe I used to like them. To put it mildly this album was Heart's contribution to the 1980s 'hair band' movement. Synthesizers and drum machines have taken over for Nancy and Howard's guitar playing. Dreamboat Anne and Little Queen still sound as good today as they did when they were released. This CD does not.

" This (shudder) Madacy released disc is of the 1950 Martin and Lewis vehicle 'At War With the Army.' It was their first film together as stars and was a forgettable mildly enjoyable little comedy. It was adapted (and I use that term loosely) from a stage play which is kind of obvious considering most of the action takes place in two rooms. It does contain an almost memorable Soda machine gag along with a truly curious scene of Jerry Lewis dressed as a lady. The most memorable part is probably the shameful song 'The Navy Gets the Gravy (But the Army Gets the Beans)' sung by Jerry at his most high pitched.The DVD picture is pretty typical of Madacy. It's scratchy with poor contrast and visible compression artifacts. It is however easier to make out than a previous video I had bought from Front Row Entertainment.

" When we redecorated/upgraded our kitchen 3 years ago I carefully researched new dinnerware for our 'every day' table. I loved the color (plum) of these and bought them.

I have replaced several pieces but they just continue to chip and they look horrible with a bright white chipped spot in the middle of the beautiful purple bowl or plate. Even those that are not chipped have strange marks and fading on the glaze.I cannot with integrity recommend these pottery pieces as they are low fire almost 'plaster of paris' inside to anyone because if they are like mine have been they will be chipped in very short order -- even with careful handling.Since there was no butter dish to match these plates and bowls I purchased a 'Fiesta ware' purple one and it is still beautiful with no chipping or signs of wear such as the glaze fading. I will be replacing the Waechtersbach with it as I feel that I have given the Waechtersbach more than generous 'try.'I am genuinely surprised that no one else has mentioned this fate to their own plates and dishes.

I was actually ashamed of screen veteran Robert Patrick's performance....silly punchlines and almost a robotic performance. WWE wrestler John Cena's performance looks as if it was painfully rehearsed one too many times...even the exotic Kelly Carlson's (who had probably every man in the theater wanting her to go to her NipTuck ways of nakedness or sexy lingerie.....sorry fellas no such luck)portayal of Kate Triton(John's fiance) leaves her acting abilities a little less desirable. Even the supporting cast of almost relative unknowns...except for Morgan(Anthony Ray Parker who many may remember played Dozer in the Matrix) however his bad punchlines uneven temper and constant 'black man plight' rants couldnt give CPR to a movie that began drowning from the opening credits.

" John Cena is perfect as the former marine who goes on a rampage to rescue his wife from killers. The movie moves fast and its slick production and sets adds to the visual eye candy.My only beef is with the WWF empire that produces these Wrestler-turned-Action Star movies. The WWF gave us Stone Cold Steve Austin in THE CONDEMNED which was fun and Austin was great. But like THE MARINE we see almost zero of the world famous torsoes of these super heroes. In THE CONDEMEND Austin never takes off his shirt for one scene. And he has a body to die for. in THE MARINE you've got about l5 seconds where we see Cena without his shirt and his body is amazing. But after that he's fully covered. The reason I worship these wrestling super stars is because they're so damned good looking and they don't mind strutting their stuff in a pair of speedoes. One can only hope that the next WWF action thriller will give us a super star wrestler who exhibits his chest --like Schwartzenneger Stallone Von Damm--and give us fans something to thrill to. ",2.0
" 'The Marine' has an instant appeal. While not innovative it sports some eye-popping pyrotechnics and chase scenes that don't give the audience a chance to catch its breath. John Cena fans will likely be enthralled especially since his character acquires some boxing and martial arts abilities to add to his wrestling repertoire. (Nine lives don't hurt either.) Even the threads and riveting music draw our attention; both a modest update to 'Miami Vice' (the TV series). Seeming random at first John Tritan (Cena) gets established as a sort of Iraq War Rambo whose prowess will undoubtedly help him save his domestic life. Coming home he finds his new job as a security guard dull even if it gets him on the eleven o'clock news and another chance to come home to Kay (Kelly Carlson) his pretty young wife. The plot is simple",2.0

They decide to take a road trip have a good time together but his wife gets kidnapped oh noo! Yeah so now Mr. Marine must save her. In the process he beats a lot of bad guys.

" Thank god I borrowed this movie from my roommate. I doubt I would have ever even rented it if I was back in the states (I'm in Iraq right now). This is going to be a short review for a pretty bad movie.Before you read my review please take not that I'm an action movie fan. Whether it's a good one with a pretty decent plot or a fun one where you can drink and laugh to it with its whack out plot and crazy actions scenes. This movie just fell short of anything fun or good.The beginning intro with Cena rescuing some marine buddies was action packed but choreographed horribly. It looked incredibly fake. My hopes for a decent movie faded quickly.One of the cooler parts of the movie was a bank heist that was led by Rome (Robert Patrick better known as T1000 from T2). If it wasn't for the horrible direction and script Patrick would've pulled this character off in a very cool way. This scene gave me hope for an ok movie to maybe get a little drunk to and laugh at the over the top action scenes.Then comes the kidnapping. It felt like 40 minutes of the movie we watched Cena run and jump through the woods trying to rescue his girl from the bad guys. Pretty annoying.Then we see the bad guys take refuge in an abandoned bar in the middle of a swamp that the police were JUST in. Honestly I believe there would've been cops that would've stayed there JUST in case this exact scenario would have happened...but whatever... I dont expect common sense to happen in action movies... especially bad ones like this. So we have Cena taking out bad guy after bad guy here till the oh so predictable twist of the movie happens.If you like explosions trust me about this you'll see massive ones every 25 minutes of the movie it seems like.Also Kate (Kelly Carlson from Nip/Tuck) played a pretty good part for such a bad role. What really makes me irritated about her part though was that she gave the bad guys SUCH hell that there is no way they wouldn't have just killed her to get rid of the crap she was putting them through. Like I said earlier I dont mind cheese in bad action movies but this was just driving me nuts.I gave it 2 stars mainly for Robert Patrick. Like I said earlier he played his part as well as he could for the craptastic script. I would love to see him with a similar role in a movie that's in better hands. ",2.0
" When I went to this movie I was hoping for something decent. But instead I found out that it was the worst action movie that I've ever seen. I'm a fan of the WWE but I know that the wresters can't act to save thier lives. But I went to see this movie because I was hoping that it would make me change my mind. But it didn't there was only one good scene in the movie and that was the very first 5 minutes. John Cena's character in Iraq showed how brave our troops truly are even though he went in guns ablazing. I love action movies I love the testaterone pumping flicks like Terminator 2 Predator and Casino Royale. But this movie didn't get me excited in fact it made me laugh. By the end of the movie my sides hurt from laughing so hard. John Cena is about as good of an actor as he is in the ring. His character survives around 6 or 7 massive explosions without a scratch. I don't mind when an action flick has scenes that can't happen in real life but this was overkill. The only reason I gave this move 2 out of 5 stars instead of 1 was because of it's portrayal of how brave our troops are over in Iraq. When I went to go see it with my friend he and I were probably the only people without Cena shirts on so if you're a fan of Cena then you'll love this movie. I for one can't beleive how crappy of a movie it was. Don't waste your money on this go buy a copy of Terminator 2 you'll thank me. ",2.0

" For the first half hour of this movie the viewer may get the idea that the script Michelle Gallagher and Alan B. McElroy is just awful (with good perception!) but as the film's story evolves the idea that this may just be a National Lampoon parody of action flicks - and if that is the case it is truly a funny bit of entertainment - for a while. Then it becomes obvious that the minimal storyline (ex-Marine's wife is abducted by diamond thieves and Marine elects to leave his one day 'security job' and take the initiative to capture his wife and strike down the bad guys in the swamps of North Carolina) is really just a matrix for staging as many pyrotechniques explosions as possible. It does get tedious.The 'star' of this noisy 'Unrated-for-destructive-violence' film is one John Cena another wrestler from WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) being promoted by the director John Bonito to follow the path of The Rock",2.0

" Patrick was the only real enjoyable part of this whole movie and he kept it entertaining which is the only reason I could think of anyone (who's not a kid or a Cena fan)wanting to see this movie. The movie pretty much portrays Cena in the action film genre as the WWE portrays him as a WWE superstar invincible unbeatable and never get's injured. The way bullets and explosions always seem to miss him make it seem like John Woo films (such as Hard Boiled)are realistic enough to be documentaries. The 2 scenes I can easily point out as examples include when Cena is driving a car at the car the villians are driving and 2 or 3 villians are unloading magazine after magazine rounds at the 'front' of the car shattering the window destroying the hood and yet not one even scratches Cena who doesn't even try to dodge most of them (there's one part where he tries to put up a bullet proof vest but that only lasts for a couple seconds and you mine as well forget it ever happened when compared to the rest of the scene). Then the part at the end fight (with Patrick) where Cena takes a sledgehammer to the gut at a full force impact then continues the fight 15 seconds later like nothing happened.The movie is good as a one time popcorn flick with a few buddies but even then it would still not be enjoyable since like in 9 out of 10 Cena matches in the WWE Cena wins and the opponent(s) people are really cheering for and who are overall better than Cena (in this case Patrick has better charisma and acting skills) lose.See it if you want but I would put it on the 'pass' list. There are worse movies than this. ",2.0

" If you overlook the fact that they use a Army cover (hat) instead of a Marine one and you over look that the Officer salutes and enlisted man first and not the correct way which is the other way around and if you over look the unbelievable plot and you overlook the poor acting and you over look the over the top explosions and seemingly bullet proof cop car (except when it flying through the air upside down) and you over look the campy dialog and you overlook the super human aspect of a number of the characters like being beat mercilessly with a steel pole and they can still save the day nearly unfettered and if you over look all of that and so much more you'll have an enjoyable film.It is your by the book boy loves girl girl gets in danger boy saves girl they live happily ever after with overly excessive explosions and no surprises no intrigue predictable from the opening scene to the last one type of low grade movie. If none of these little quirks and so many more do not bother you then you might enjoy this. It is at best a `rent it' and not a `buy it' if you must see it you have to see it. But if you opt to skip it you're not missing much in the least. I give it 2 stars and I'm being kind. ",2.0
" You know those movies from back in the day that you thought were great but you watch them now and think they are the worst movies ever made? This movie could certainly fit the later but whether you think it is any good in the first place remains to be seen. The quality of this movie or lack thereof as the case may be is evidenced in the filming sequence (you've seen it a 100 times before in every B movie that has come before it) and the dialog (painful) of the opening scene. There is no plot nor dialog to be had in this movie.This movie is about WWE style action and John Cena. Some good points the death of Angela was a fun scene as well as John's police car going over the cliff. That sequence was excellent but of course the 5 minutes that preceded that of the police car getting shot up was way over the top and beyond belief. I hope they were just making fun of bad action films but I think they were actually just being one. There are a couple of other so unbelievable scenes that I was actually left feeling the director could care less about the intelligence level of his adult audience.So I really can not recommend this movie and thought it bad enough to write a review. If you are a fan of WWE and John Cena and want to see action no more believable as what you might see on Smackdown you may very well like this movie. There is nothing wrong with that if that is your bag and the 16 year old WWE fan I took seemed to like it. But if you expect to get more for your money then I recommend passing on this one.I did want to add a few comments. First I seem to have hit a nerve with some fans. Sorry. That is my honest review. Don't smack-me-down because I really hated this movie that you may have liked. As I said it may very well be likable by some people as it was by the 16 year old I took to see it. Heck I actually enjoyed Paris Hilton's one hit wonder but I'm honest enough to know that many people think even less of her then I did of this movie. All the more power to them as long at they are honest in their review. So give me a break on that please. I did also want to add one thing I liked about this movie which is at least it was cheaper to take my fiance and her son to see it then it was to pay for one pay per view smackdown. ",2.0

" THE MARINE proves yet again that an action movie needs to have the focus on the hero and his motivation. When a film like this one has some truly outstanding fiery explosions to maintain a viewer's interest that attention span will last only for as long as do the FX and even with that there are diminishing returns. John Cena the WWE wrestler is John Triton an ex-Marine discharged from the Corps only because he disobeyed orders to save the lives of three fellow marines. You would think his commanding officer would have understood. He takes a job as a security officer and gets fired immediately again for just doing his job. The primary problem with THE MARINE is the expectation that one has in terms of why one sees this film. I choose to see action movies that have a hard to achieve balance between the exploits of the action star and the believability of the plot. Stallone had no problem doing that in any of his RAMBO films. Cena has a long way to go to find this happy medium.Robert Patrick is the Bad Guy. He mugs makes unwelcome advances to Cena's wife and generally conducts a criminal campaign on the fly. You know that an action film is off kilter when the Bad Guy by default becomes the focus of interest. Cena does little more than take beatings give beatings narrowly escape death in fiery car crashes and scowl on cue. If Cena has a future in acting that future is probably in the ring as a wrestler.

" This movie is almost a joke. The beginning starts off quite nicely with our 'Marine' taking down 9 terrorist with a machine gun and hand-to-hand combat without even being touched. The problem is later in the movie our same 'Marine' is knocked down with a fire extinguisher a branch and a bar. Apparently terrorists trained in the military with machine guns are much less capable than a man with a fire extinguisher.Second the 'Marine' was knocked unconscious by both the fire extinguisher and tree branch yet being punched hard multiple times tied to a chair he is left un-phased.Third our 'Marine' seems to get punched a lot for being such a skilled fighter. Even going up against hill billies he gets thrown through a table. Which also shows hill billies are skilled in hand to hand combat a reality this movie taught me.Fourth no one seems to care that our well respected 'Marine' leaves a wounded cop unattended and steals a cop car. Throughout the movie he causes hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage without being reprimanded.Fifth a good portion of the movie consist of our 'Marine' following people through the woods. That's it.... Wow.... Exciting.....Sixth our marine jumps out of a flaming car over the edge of a cliff. 10 minutes later he is walking on land. Apparently it is left to our imagination how marines can fly.Seventh When our 'Marine' gives CPR its just pathetic. It looks funny to begin with because John Cena's arms are as big as his wifes body but its even worse because he doesn't do CPR right to begin with.I'll be fair there were good fight scenes. There was a girl-girl fight scene (which lasted about 1 minute) though it was much more entertaining than the WWE girl-girl 'matches'. This movie was not action packed it had action but was not action packed. ",2.0
" This movie was not meant to be taken seriously....I think what they tried to do here is re-live the 80's action flick experience. If you watch this movie you are falsly lead to believe that you can be blown up and still survive take a fire extinguisher to the face and get right back up and can be shot at 100's of times and not take a hit. The dialouge is silly however the acting is pretty good. Sit back and enjoy/laugh. ",2.0
" I really hope the American Military didn't support this movie considering how things are going over there in order to recruit more bodies. If so that was a poor attempt. After watching this movie it left me quite speechless. War is entirely different and should not be made glamorous for recruiting purposes.'The Marine' is a very simple film with a few minor twists here and there. In the tradition of The Rock John Cena has begun a movie career after gaining notoriety as a wrestler. Both wrestlers/actors are muscle bound former college football players. Whereas The Rock has now proven he can act in a variety of roles Cena has just proven that he can do action. His role in 'The Marine' is evidence that he may very well be successful in films but he will need to find better material than this. The directing here is nothing special but seeing this is John Bonito's first feature I have nothing to support my cause as I have nothing more to base it on but he is able to deliver a film that is very easy and even if Bonito got a little explosion happy. The plot however is pointless. Throughout this movie these imbecile thieves call attention to themselves every chance they get. After robbing a jewelry store they don't just stroll away as no one outside knows what they did. They blow up a cop car. Why? I have no idea. One member of the group is prone to telling sad stories of his youth. Too often the camera lingers on the bad guys and then quickly gives us a shot of Cena running. Sure Patrick is a bigger movie star than Cena but this is Cena's movie. I really did not care about the bad guys other than how Cena is going to kick their [...].I will say that Cena has the build and look of an action hero in the grain of Jean-Claude Van Damme. He fits right in with the 'unstoppable 80's action hero mold.' He is 90% muscle and 10% charm. He has few lines of dialogue but does well enough with what he has. Robert Patrick hammed it up but seemed to relish playing a wise-cracking psychotic murderer. No one else is worth mentioning as it seems paychecks were just collected. Cena who is also a rapper had also been wearing military attire at his matches. No doubt he is doing so for publicity sake of this movie which celebrates Marines as heroes which is great but nothing he can do is going to generate enough interest to make 'The Marine' a success. ",2.0
" 'The Marine' reminds me of the old-fashioned action films made in the 1980s like Arnold Schwarzenegger's 'Commando.' If you remember this film our hero is a retired elite commando single-handedly saves the kidnapped daughter and kills all the bad guys. The story is incredible I know but fun nonetheless.In 'The Marine' WWE's John Cena plays that hero John Triton a marine discharged for disobeying the direct orders. The difference here is that the hero has to rescue his wife kidnapped by the diamond robbers and the gangs' leader is played by Robert Patrick. And watching 'Commando' is more fun.Frankly I don't care the wooden acting of the cast and the predicable (and unrealistic) story as long as the film provides good actions. Actually I found John Cena is not that bad as critics say and Kelly Carlson as his wife did a fine job. Also 'The Marine' has one car chases with good stunt and one funny one-liner about Robert Patrick's career making role.But things start to look silly when these actions are drawn-out. There are scenes big explosions but they only help lower the film's tension as the poorly-written storyline and choppy editing make it clear that none of these poses a danger to the protagonist who can easily survive and go to the next set-piece. Moreover it's not exciting to see the baddies fighting among them more then once. It's not thrilling to watch them trudging through thick mud of the swamp either.'The Marine' is an old-school action film that needs someone capable of handling the materials (themselves not bad) in a much better form.

Then it offers impassive photos of the Warehouse Arts District and dilapidated fence structures of no particular aesthetic merit interest or relevance.The few published photos available to the buyer are quite nice. Nonetheless the book itself offers little more in the way of exotic balcony gardens or lush French Quarter design to inspire ardent gardeners.

" Asimov had some interesting concepts in this novel. It's unfortunate that he killed them with his stale characters and unbelievable plot devices.

" I read this book based on overall good reviews of the series and Asimov in general. The story had some interesting moments and actually started off quite solidly. But then the politics took over and the Sci-Fi aspect was completely lost. This book felt like a drama class play that could have taken place anywhere and almost at anytime. I never felt like I was in space or that anything related to Sci-Fi was present. I didnt mind the story so much but being a Sci-Fi book means that I expect some technical 'sciency' details and didnt get anything in this book. I also did not like the huge jump from each major chapter regarding time. Just when you feel that the plot and characters are 'settlling-in' you jump 80 years and have to start all over again. Lastly there was very little scene setup. I rarely knew where the dialog was taking place or what the surroundings were...hence the comparison to a stage play.If you like Arthur Clark's style of Sci-Fi like me and prefer the Science aspect of Sci-Fi to be featured in books you read then I would not recommend this book. It is somewhat over-rated and isn't really Sci-Fi In my opinion.... ",2.0
" The first time I tried to read Foundation I was six years old and it was simply too complex for my developing mind. Just a few months ago however I was cleaning out my attic and came across the same old book. To ascertain it's actual nature as interpreted by the adult mind I read it again. I was amazed not only by the sheer brillance and ingenuity of the ideas contained within it not only by the grandiose size of the subject matter but mostly by the writing which I regarded as absolutely horrid. The plot is clunky the conversations roll off the tongue like sandpaper covered in peanut butter and the descriptions could have been written better by some obscure species of mosquito. As a book it could be improved by changing the title from 'Foundation' to 'How Not to Write a Book' or 'Please Steal These Ideas and Rewrite Them in English.' I highly reccomend it to people for use as a very expensive and ineffective paperweight. ",2.0
" I have heard so much about this book over the years but didn't like Asimov's writing so I never read it. Well I thought maybe this was different but no it's the same poor writing. I love the idea of psychohistory but that's where the love ends for this book. And Hari Seldon dies before we get to know and like him. Dull mostly pointless conversations between people you don't know as the story jumps quickly over time ruin this book. And how lazy of Asimov to not develop his ideas. At one point he gets out of this by having a character watch a movie that we can't see which describes something that would have been interesting and clever had it been developed.I guess I'll finish the series because I've heard the other books are better. Phew glad I got this out of the way. ",2.0

" 'Foundation' is considered by many SF devotees to be one of the greatest creations of the genre. It won the Hugo award to prove it spawned many sequels and even a couple of prequels. I was excited to read this book expecting it to live up to its many accolades.Boy was I disappointed!The basic idea of this novel is fascinating",2.0
" Right where a character talks about his old age of sixty-two years.Yeah right. An advanced galactic civilization thousands of years old with FTL travel and turnkey exoplanets just right for human habitation everywhere never bothered to find medical treatments for aging. That might have sounded plausible in science fiction 60+ years ago but much less so today. The novel also suffers from a lot of faults which other reviewers have noted. Perhaps Asimov's stories blew geeks' minds in the 1940's and 1950's but his work hasn't aged well.BTW Asimov Heinlein Clarke Carl Sagan and a lot of other scientifically knowledgeable people in the mid 20th Century accepted the existence of exoplanets based on NO evidence at all until the mid 1990's while at the same time criticizing similar claims without evidence as woo-woo. Just by coincidence the exoplanet faith position happened to resemble observable reality somewhat - but it didn't have to. Even then the existence of so many 'hot Jupiters' surprised a lot of astronomers involved in the hunt for exoplanets. Exoplanetologists may not find plausible earthlike planets for many years. ",2.0
" I couldn't wait to read the first of the Foundation novels having got such great reviews and having heard that it's been such an inspiration to so many other sci-fi authors. But I could barely finish it. The book is flat-out boring. There is no action choosing rather to focus mostly on matters of political intrigue. If you like watching CSPAN then you'll love this book.There is also no continuity of storyline or characters. The book constantly jumps ahead in time right about the time you've wrapped your head around the current characters and plot.It's like a set of boring short stories loosely stitched together with an single underlying theme.

" This seems like awfully shoddy science fiction to me. The old complaint about thin characterization isn't even the worst of it nor are the crazy anachronisms [rampant cigar smoking newspapers and casual misogyny]. But so much of this plot develops in the form of uninteresting local political maneuvers between slightly AynRandized heroes and buffooning villians with no sense of place or grandeur whatsoever.The timeline of the novel is suddenly too breif after introducing the vast concept of a 40000 year swing through history and neither the future society Asimov has envisioned nor the apparant brilliance of the plan at the heart of this series are ever portrayed convincingly. Whatever powerful effect this book may have had in its day it is bereft of it now. ",2.0
" Foundation is the epitome of the ideal of the pessimistic technocratic utopian. Strange as it may sound the plot is as follows",2.0
" The book is written about an empire in the future. I'm not really sure why Asimov thought that the future galaxy would be ruled by an emporer which is a dying system of government instead of a democratic republic. I know this is nit-picking but I didn't like this book.Apparently the future can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy using math and statistics. Anyone who works as a mathematician or statistician as I do knows that it's difficult to predict what's going to happen in anyone's life tomorrow much less the entire world 500 to 1000 years into the future using statistics.This book is intellectual worship which is something I can't stand. Intellectual worship is when people think they are intellecually superior to everyone else so feel they should rule over everyone else if only you would listen to them. This idea drips off the page as event after event is predicted by some really smart dude. This smart dude predicted a collapse of civilization and treated it as inevitable. Another idea that's patently absurd- that any event that occurs is inevitable.If this guy was so smart as to predict with a high degree of accuracy the downfall of civilization and the rising of a new one along with the traumatic events this new civilization would go through why wasn't he smart enough to avert the downfall of the original civilization. Surely with his predictive ability people would listen to him but he decides to let it crumble for whatever reason.And Asimov is a mediocre writer. The story is only moderately interesting because no character really gets developed. I read this book because as a sci-fi fan I felt obligated. ",2.0
" When I was in junior high school Asimov's Foundation Trilogy was my favorite science fiction. Recently I picked it back up and have had to revise my opinion somewhat.First in terms of character and plot development Asimov certainly hadn't hit his stride when he wrote these books. The characters are cardboard cutouts--especially the female characters.More importantly Asimov uses the basic idea behind the series...that Hari Seldon created his 'psychohistory plan' and launched it invisibly determining the future of his Foundations for centuries...as a kind of magic box from which he pulls plot developments. This drains the story of dramatic tension. One knows from the get-go that it'll all work out in the wash. (In the second half of 'Foundation and Empire' and 'Second Foundation' Asimov had found a way out of this problem by introducing a wild card in the deck.)Finally the book hasn't aged well. The technology forseen for his far-future galactic civilization seems positively 'retro'. Normally this wouldn't be a problem...Orwell's 1984 is still an effective piece of fiction even though it's 2002 and the world is far different from the world Orwell envisioned...but the Foundation books' other flaws just seem to make this worse. ",2.0
" The Foundation novel is very dated which I suppose is a function of the time it was written. Women are almost entirely absent except when they turn to putty over pretty pieces of jewelry. A gun is an 'atomic blaster' and other quaint 50s relics.The one dimensionality of the characters is problematic. I have to admit that although I don't read a lot of science fiction I know priority is never put on characterization. However since nearly all of the ideas of the book are no longer relevant this shortcoming becomes glaring. The book is more of a time capsule than a living book.There is actually a single main character who re-occurs as 3 different personas (Seldon Hardin and Mallow). SeldonHardenMallow is calm calculating and always right. His opponents flail around until the denouement when SeldumHardenMallow has maneuvered them into exactly the right position and emerges victorious. It's so predictable that there isn't any dramatic tension.The biggest problem I had with the book is that the politics seem very nave. This novel was supposedly based on Gibbon's 'The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire' but Foundation seems to have only to most primitive understanding of that work.I don't really understand the love generated toward this book. It seems particularly flat. A lot of people seem to enjoy it -- just not me I guess. ",2.0
" Just writing this to provide moral support for anyone who reads this book and is thoroughly underwhelmed.Asimov's prose is clean but his tone seems uneven in this installment as opposed to the tighter first book.The book is essentially two disconnected adventures... not very appealing.There's a female character in the second adventure that's quite problematic; she's dull and Asimov spends a lot of time and effort on the fact that she's (gasp) not male.Finally this series feels very dated in terms of language attitudes and even vision of the future. 'Nuclear' is the buzzword; everything's like the '50s but nuclear-powered.I liked Foundation but Foundation & Empire tends to wander away from the idea of the Foundation as the main character and instead can't seem to decide whether to focus on galactic-level events or protagonists. This would be excusable if the protagonists were interesting.Go read Jack Vance or Gene Wolfe if you want masterful sci-fi! ",2.0

" The book Foundation by Isaac Asimov has promise but leaves the reader without satisfaction upon completion. Though having what initially appears to be a gripping plot the grip loosens throughout the book. While philosophers may enjoy the lack of action and adventure other readers who crave that amazingly described action sequence will find that this is not the book to get. Taking place beyond the year 12000 A.D the Galactic Empire spanning galaxies is predicted by the revered physcohistorian Hari Seldon to crumble. On a mission to shorten a period of 30000 years of barbarism after the fall of the Galactic Empire to a mere millennium he establishes an association the Foundation to preserve the Universe's knowledge in a giant Encyclopedia. Foundation takes place on many different planets in many galaxies across the universe. This book spans many generations and involves many characters as the book covers in different plot lines that converge at the end.Foundation is a book that focuses on political issues thus making the book void of action and adventure. This can make the book extremely boring and aggravating to some readers. The story focuses on conflicts among activist parties and groups conspiring against the political leaders of the Foundation's home world Terminus as well as diplomatic and religious conflicts between the Foundation's home planet Terminus and neighboring kingdoms such as Anacreon and Smyrno along with greedy kingdoms bent on conquest of their neighbors. But out of the 285 pages of the book there is only one significant action sequence which is between the kingdom of Anacreon and the Foundation. The sequence involves a mass riot and uprising of priests on Anacreon's home world along with the total emancipation of the Anacreonian naval fleet by a priest who threatens to curse the fleet. When characters like the mayor of Terminus and his advisors discuss war or the inevitability of a war there never is an explanation of what occurs during the fighting just a summary of the war and who is the victor. An example is at the end of the book when there is a war between the Foundation and the world of Korell because of disagreements over religious beliefs and the tolerance of missionaries. The war is only summed up in an excerpt from the 'Encyclopedia Galactica'. Another noticeable point about Foundation is how confusing it is in many aspects. The book is broken up into 'Parts' that separate time setting and characters. A part entitled 'The Mayors' which takes place mainly on Terminus and involves the mayor Salvor Hardin and the relations between his world and the kingdom of Anacreon is then followed by one entitled 'The Traders' which takes place many decades later and involves totally different characters in a different part of the galaxy. When and where each part takes place is not answered until later into the chapters of the part. Also confusing is the fact that new characters are introduced quickly in every part thus making it harder for the reader to grasp. If the reader gets attached to a character or really likes where the plot and characters are going in a certain part he or she will be unpleasantly surprised when those characters are never talked about again in the novel after that part.One good thing about Foundation is that it expresses new and intriguing ideas about predicting the future through the science of psychohistory and what the human race and universe will be like in ten more millennia. This includes the idea of having a Galactic Empire that controls millions of planets. Along with ideas of nuclear power still being the most advanced power system man-sized force fields able to block any nuclear handgun's blast and giant space ships with the capability to destroy planets are discussed. Also the ideas of monarchy being the prime governmental system is included in the novel. These may seem like interesting ideas that would make Foundation a great book but the reader may find that these ideas also make the story harder to understand because they are either seemingly too primitive for the time period or too far-fetched to be logical. This book could be someone's favorite book if they happen to like philosophical books without action. It could also be the bore of a lifetime for some people. ",2.0
" With all the rave reviews about this book perhaps I set my hopes too high. I just really didn't care for this book. There is almost no character development (since every chapter spans huge jumps in time) and the 'science' in this novel takes a back seat to the political ideas of the author. With endless pages of dialog and few reasons to care about any of the characters I had a very hard time getting through this one. And while I know it was written years ago the author's science-fantasy was pretty much limited to 'nuclear powered devices.' That just didn't feel like much of a stretch of the imagination all things considered.I thoroughly enjoy sci-fi when told by authors such as H.G. Wells and Ray Bradbury. These authors know how to paint a picture in your mind and bathe your imagination in colorful imagery. In Foundation however I was thoroughly unimpressed by the style context and story as told by Azimov - it was boring unimaginative and I never even had the pleasure of painting the scene being played out in my mind. I would definitely not recommend this book. ",2.0

" Asimov is often said to have a flat style and to be unable to create credible characters. It's my opinion. And Asimov is never more ridiculous than when he writes about feelings especially about love (scenes seem to be described by a child or a thinking machine). But this writer is still gifted at setting clever plots every reader will enjoy for instance in his robots tales (of course do not expect more than a quality entertainment as often with sci-fi). However Fondation is not really a clever book ; it is not boring but it has poor content. You will finish it but probably won't read it again. First problem it is impossible to believe in psychohistory which smells like positivist propaganda from the 19th century. And because he has nothing more than an adventure story to tell Asimov uses all kinds of tricks to grip the reader including lots of surprises justified by unlikely and twisted arguments some of which you may find hard to swallow. To conclude Fondation is a kind of cartoon ",2.0

Actors who make this type of mistake rarely call it quits; they merely head into the realm of B movies where all things are possible if one is willing to throw such antiquated notions like dignity and art to the wind.

If you haven't bought or listened to any of this album yet listen to the Amazon cuts of 'The Music That Makes Me Dance' and 'People' alone to see what I mean.Let's face it -- if this album came out today on its own merits with Ms. Streisand as a newcomer or even an 'American Idol' contestant you would stay away in droves. No amount of blond hair dye can turn back the vocal clock.So in the spirit of the kind of blunt honesty I hope Ms. Streisand would appreciate let's call this is an admirable effort from a legend who deserves an atta-girl for still getting up to sing in front of a VERY well paying crowd. But what one is buying really is a necessary filler for a complete Streisand collection and not much more. There's nothing wrong with that.We don't have many living legends left so if you want to celebrate longevity you could do worse than to buy Barbra's journey from autumn to winter. ",2.0

" I had the opportunity to see Barbra Streisand in concert in Boston and it was one of the best times I have had in recent memory. She still looked beautiful sang some of the songs very well and even interacted with the audience in a way she never seemed to in her previous live recordings. That being said I do think this live CD is probably not her best.As many have said her voice has obviously lost some of its power and you can truly hear her struggling to sing some songs that in the past she sang almost effortlessly. She also sounds like she is about to lose her voice and/or breath altogether at times. And while she sings many of the must sings not only must it be said that the original recordings sound better but have even been performed better on discs such as One Voice or The Concert.In both acts she comes out singing almost as good as ever with her voice astounding you with the fact she hits all the notes and can still hold them for a long time. However as the acts go on the voice slowly starts to deteriorate with her struggling through some of the more challenging songs.That being said I do realize she is getting older and the voice always goes as a singer matures. But here it just sounds like Barbra hasn't been taking care of it very well especially since many about her age like Aretha Franklin and Liza Minnelli still have a lot of voice left (especially if you consider all the stuff they have done to themselves over the years). If two performers who have famously neglected caring for their voices over the years can still pull off a good performance why can't she? People have even said she doesn't even do a warm up before she performs.While she does quite a few good performances (especially in the beginning) you could tell Il Divo was there to hide her struggling. Also the sequence seems a little uneven with all the hits and Funny Girl at the beginning and mostly obscure songs in the second act. If she mixed it up a little more and tried to make more surprising choices (like with 'Ma Premiere Chaison') this would have been a true must have.As it is this is a for-the-fans purchase. If you are looking to start collecting her albums this is not the place to start. If you are interested in how she sounds live her 1994 Concert recording is a better place to start. Anyone who listens to this will feel like they missed something by not being there and they will be right. ",2.0

" In BLACK EAGLE Jean Claude Van Damme had barely begun making a name for himself. He was less well-known than Sho Kosugi with whom he had to share top billing. The plot is a nonsense actioner between Kosugi as a CIA op and JCVD as his KGB counterpart. What is of interest is Van Damme's interpreation of a Red bad guy. This was not his first appearance as a Russian fighter. In NO RETREAT NO SURRENDER he was Ivan a Russian mafia enforcer. Here he is Andrei a KGB operative who is battling Kosugi for a secret weapon. When Van Damme plays the heavy he is somehow more threatening more lethal than when he is the punching bag good guy. One of his best moments in this or any of his other actioners occurs when he is not fighting at all. He is seen as merely talking to his wife who is genuinely concerned for his safety. Their verbal interaction marks him as distinctly human as they ponder his looming fate. Further his aggressive fight scenes with Kosugi are first rate. Van Damme's untimely demise with a ship's propeller raises some unexpected sighs of sympathy. BLACK EAGLE is a watchable early slice of a very young JCVD as he proves that given the right script he can deliver acting on cue with the same verve as one of his patented roundhouse kicks. ",2.0

The biggest action scene is an explosion of a small wooden boat and a chase scene with cars going as fast as 25 mph!

" Recently my wife and I wanted to see a decent drama. (TV really has become the 'wasteland' predicted in the 1950's; moreover we didn't know that the 2005 version of Charles Dickens' 'Bleak House' would be re-run on PBS within the next few weeks. We'd missed it last year.) So we checked our old VHS collection and found we'd taped the 13-part series 'To Serve Them All My Days' from Masterpiece Theatre in the mid-1980's. Our copies even included insightful commentary from Alistair Cooke. Remember him?At the end of 'To Serve Them All My Days' Mr. Cooke said an upcoming program would be 'The Good Soldier ' a 1981 BBC production. We didn't remember this one and thought it might be worth viewing if it was anywhere near the quality of 'To Serve Them All My Days.' Stars of 'The Good Soldier' were said to include Jeremy Brett of Sherlock Holmes fame and Elizabeth Garvie who played Elizabeth Bennett in a quite entertaining version of 'Pride and Prejudice' in 1979. Robin Ellis whom we also liked in 'Poldark' would play John Dowell the vacuous American husband and narrator of 'The Good Soldier.'I searched the Amazon.com listings to see if 'The Good Soldier' might be available on DVD. Amazingly it was due to come out the following week. The reason I go into all this is to say we had every reason to believe that this production would be a good one coming as it did from what we regard as the 'golden age' of Masterpiece Theatre. What we got instead was disappointing.In all honesty we did find most of the acting scenery costumes and other production features of 'The Good Soldier' to be fine. It was the story that let us down--if there really is a story. From what we can tell the saga takes place in the 9-year period before World War I 1904-1913. It's possible the author Ford Madox Ford (who had changed his last name from the very German Hueffer) wanted to return to a more pleasant era when he finished this piece in 1915. This was shortly after World War I broke out. If the author also wanted to show how decadent and purposeless things were at that time he may have succeeded there too.As I was saying the story takes place about 100 years ago and centers on two middle-aged couples. One is English (Edward and Leonora Ashburnham); the other American (John and Florence Dowell). They meet at a German spa and get along so well they keep meeting there over nine ensuing summers. On the surface they seem well-behaved well-dressed and friendly. But beneath the calm and elegant facade Edward is a latter-day Casanova whom women find irresistible. He seduces one woman after another right under his wife's nose finally to include Florence the wife of his friend John Dowell. (Florence has been faking a heart condition in order to reduce John to the role of solicitous keeper). But when she sees Edward alone with his teenage niece Nancy Florence gets jealous and kills herself. When Edward can't have Nancy he also kills himself. Nancy who came from a broken home and was raised by nuns then goes insane. Despite all this John Dowell ends up with Nancy and becomes her keeper just as he'd been for Florence.Some of the dialogue seems tongue-in-cheek if not downright campy. One example is where Leonora accuses Florence of being a whore. Florence objects but Leonora dead-pans 'All whores say that.' (Ironic since Leonora is supposed to be a devout Irish Catholic and sensitive about her faith and heritage. Also she's quite privileged and refined. What would she know about whores?) Similarly John Dowell seems to be especially gullible and naive all the way through the story even as he narrates. In fact he starts his narration with the quote 'This is the saddest story I've ever heard.' John also says shortly after his wife's suicide 'Now I can marry Nancy.' Maybe it's supposed to be funny? Maybe not? We're told in the analysis that the author wanted John to be 'an unreliable narrator.' Oh well at least we're spared the Louis Carroll line",2.0

I have to hold the pot directly under a light to see the markings at all. Also I often find that my rice is not cooked through when the cooker indicates it is finished. The final straw for me is that it is pretty cumbersome to clean. If it made perfect rice the cleanup wouldn't be an issue but I'm not sure that the rice in this cooker has ever turned out as good as the cheap one I used to have that I picked up at Target.

" I received this rice cooker from Amazon.com in early July 2010 and it performed beautifully for about seven months. It's sturdy and very easy to clean. We made rice about twice a week with no problems. Then the 'WARM' light stopped working and it shut off automatically. Next the 'WARM' light started working again but the rice was hard even though all the water had been absorbed. We used the same type of rice (long grain brown) and the same proportion of one cup rice to two cups water that we always used. The time it took the cooker to finish also didn't change.We paid $48 plus shipping. That makes each batch of rice cost approximately $l to cook based on the cost and estimated 56 batches (two batches a week for seven months).

" A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court did a very good job informing the reader about the Biblical justification of some very important Catholic Traditions. However while reading this book aside from the informative parts I felt as though I were reading a fairytale. To start the whole concept that after the death of his father Michael's mother would just pull all the children out of school to go to Kentucky seems unrealistic especially because it is near the end of the school year. Once in Kentucky everything seemed to work out just about perfect for Michael. When there he managed to learn a plethora of information about the Bible and his faith in a very short amount of time and always he knew it just when he needed it. Also at the Bible Discussions despite never having any of the books there that helped him originally he remembered perfectly every argument the books brought up and every book chapter line and verse from the Bible he sited in order to back his arguments. The response of the Fundamentalists to his proof also was somewhat too perfect for Michael. The Fundamentalists such as Luther Jimmy and Les appeared to have more of an amazed response to Michael's arguments rather then to have any really strong dissentions. Had he encountered a few more problems and a few more issues or strong objections by the Fundamentalists it would have been more genuine. Michael just always had the answers right when he needed them and they were perfect leaving almost no ground on which the Fundamentalists could stand. I think that they [the Fundamentalists] would have been much more outraged and not quite so passive of his contentions especially Les. Overall I did feel the book provided some good information about Catholic Faith and Tradition however the actual story seemed too cliche and perfect to grab the interest of this reader. ",2.0
" A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a Catholic vs. Fundamentalist Christians story. Michael the main character who went from Philadelphia to Kentucky defended Catholic views and procedures. He tried to explain new ideas to the Fundamentalist but they where not open to these ideas. I personally felt it became better towards the end of the novel. At first it was slow-moving and hard to keep track of all the characters. The description became hackneyed along with the plot. Also reading about the farm life was hard to relate to. After the heated bible discussions began the story was easier to read. Overall this book was better than I had expected. ",2.0
" The other reviewers do a good job of summarizing the plot of this novel so I will not go into those details. My one compliment to this book is that the truths of the Catholic faith are presented honestly as the young man struggles to defend his beliefs against many common misconceptions and accusations.As a story itself however the novel is trite and irritating. I really wanted to connect to this young man who lost his father but the characters of the young man his dead father his mother and siblings were too idyllically drawn to be real. While I know many good Catholics and happy families I could not relate to the O'Sheas of this book as they seemed so cloyingly perfect. I couldn't finish this book and I wouldn't even consider handing it to one of my teenagers. Perhaps those who live in a Catholic 'bubble' might find this novel interesting. I for one would rather study the catechism with my children to deepen our faith and then when reading time comes encourage my children to crack open novels with well-developed complex and compelling characters settings and plots. This novel is not one of those. ",2.0

" Beware of translated works that don't mention the name of the translator.That should have been my first clue. I'm not sure who did the translating of this collection but he obviously does not have a thorough knowledge/appreciation of Russian humour and literature. I can say this because I'm from Russia and after reading the original version of Diary of a Madman (I didn't bother further with the others) and comparing it to this one I was disappointed by how lengthy and confusing the passages were. The language was tripping over itself rather than flowing with the Gogolian humour and absurdity. It was boring and difficult to follow and had none of the finesse that for instance Pevear and Volokhonsky's version was able to capture. Most surprising is that entire sentences were missing from certain passages. It seems that whenever there was a phrase the translator couldn't make sense of or see how it fit into the scheme of things he just omitted it entirely!!! This is really offensive to the writer and unfair to the readers.For goodness sake he didn't even get the name of the dog right!! It's 'Medji' not 'Meggy'---just because this sound doesn't exist quite the same in the English language doesn't mean you can rename the dog! (Unless it isn't read 'Meggy' like 'Peggy' but most English readers will read it this way anyway)But the dog isn't the most important part. It's really the fact that the translator did not do Gogol justice. He did not treat this work with the dignity and reverence it deserves and as a result has put out a shoddy interpretation of a classic tale.I gave two stars because I did notice some attempts to capture the complexity of dry wit as is often the style of satirical Russian authors. It is indeed very difficult to do this with English. Whoever this translator was they made a solid effort; unfortunately he just couldn't carry it. And the publisher should be more selective with the quality of work it puts its stamp on. ",2.0
" The previous reviews must have come from students of theauthor's or students of students of the author's. Perhaps friends ofthe author? I can't imagine anyone thinking this book is good. A good comedy maybe.The techniques in this Ju-Jitsu book are almost offensive in terms of practicality. And though he does outline some tactics and concepts for applying the techniques of this art this is most likely a book for his students to read so they can brush up for their tests but not for serious self-defense.In fact this is not a book for any one interested in learning self-defense. Buy the book if you want to get killed on the street. Otherwise avoid it unless you're a student of the author of course.

" This movie just didn't grab me at any point. I am usually a tremendous fan of McKellan's work and like Fraser's style. However neither really clinched it in this film. The scene stealer in this blase film has to be Redgrave playing McKellan's Hungarian housekeeper. The film covers the recollections of the director of the original Frankenstein film. McKellen finds a confidante in Fraser the yard/pool boy. While the recollections could have been riveting somehow the delivery is flat and you find yourself saying 'who cares?' most of the time without forming any affinity for either character's plight. Yes McKellen is an openly gay actor and yes Fraser does a bit of a nude scene but that's no reason to run out and buy this film. Rent it on a slow Saturday afternoon.

" With his days of theatrical releases behind him Chuck Norris' career revolved almost exclusively aroundWalker Texas Ranger. His extracurricular output (i.e. DTV movies) seemed to consist mainly of favors to his sons and brother but at least those were still technically Chuck Norris vehicles unlike this one. 'Logan's War' is a film with an identity crisis wanting to be an action/revenge/mafia thriller on one hand and a quasi-inspirational drama on the other...but without Chuck Norris in the lead.

" The first of the two Cristina re-released CD albums is a whole load of fun but fans of that one need to be aware that there's no trace of disco on 'Sleep It Off' and it comes over as a bit more serious. Cristina is undoubtedly a talented and well-read wordsmith but here she takes on a more new-wave/punk-tinged musical approach which still shows off her superbly acidic lyrics but without the disco backing music it lacks the charm that made 'Doll in the Box' such a fun album.I must be in the minority here as more educated music lovers than myself are currently raving over this album but I found this one a little too arty-farty. Cristina has said herself in interviews that she considers this her true first album and dismisses 'Doll in the Box' as just a bit of cheeky fun saying it did not represent her real self. The songs on here suggest that Cristina is an angry young woman with a lot of axes to grind. She expresses her bile very succinctly but the biggest drawback to this newfound sincerity is the revelation that Cristina can't really sing that well a fact that was masked by the camp vocal delivery she applied on the previous release. It makes the songs much less pleasant to listen to which marks it as a less successful album in my book.The bottom line is that Cristina's two albums belong in entirely different genres. The first is a highly original combination of disco froth with biting sarcasm whereas the second one is heavy on the sarcasm but with none of the froth. And that's not so original it's a style that you can get from dozens of other music releases...groups like The Waitresses were doing exactly the same sort of thing around the same time. I don't think I'll get any helpful ticks for this review but buyers take note",2.0

After listening to this anemic attempt at capturing the power of a acclaimed musical portrait by using synthesized instruments one is left to wonder why a recording company hasn't recorded this piece using a large orchestra. It just begs for the real thing. At least with a large orchestra there might be more justification to charge $23 for just 33 minutes of music. I would strongly urge classical music lovers to approach with caution if they are thinking of buying any of the other selections in this classical music series played by Alexander Jero.

" I am not a fan of Melanie Griffith at all in fact the only film I really like her in is 'Working Girl'. It's not that she is a terrible actress. She is just annoying. So why did I waste over 2 hours of my time watching this movie? I am now asking myself the same thing. I wasn't sure if this movie was supposed to be a comedy. If it was it wasn't even funny. Griffith plays Lucille a woman who is beaten by her husband. She kills him and cuts his head off...Why? I have no idea. Maybe she's crazy? She then decides to leave her 7 children in the hands of her mother so she can go out to Hollywood and live out her dream of becoming a glamerous actress. She takes the head of her husband along for the ride...why not? Nothing else makes sense so far so why not make less sense. This film is just a mishmash of nonsense. She wins a lot of money in Las Vegas right before she gets to California. She eventually gets her big break...She is on t.v. Then she gets caught..eventually all criminals do. I don't know what the ending of this movie is all about...She goes free? when she was sentenced to a term in prison? Maybe the book is better I hope so cuz this was a boring movie. I watched it on cable....thank god i waited that long.The only bright spot was Lucas Black the boy from Sling Blade. He is one of the best child actors right now. I hope to see more of him in films.

" In the world of Lifetime movies a genre populated by 'based on real incidents' docudramas women in peril thrillers and prurient 'ripped from the headline' scandals or crime stories they occasionally break the mold to adapt a popular fiction. In my mind some of their more successful ventures have been these literary adaptations--'The Tenth Circle' and 'The Memory Keeper's Daughter' for example worked as stand alone movies even if fans of the books were disappointed by the oversimplification of the presentations. I think those who were intrigued by David Ebershoff's bestseller 'The 19th Wife' will likewise be displeased by this by-the-numbers accounting--but more problematic the film may also fail to appeal to newbies with no connection to the source material. This seemed a can't miss entertainment combining murder and polygamy but the story is stretched too thin and the principle characters tend to be completely unbelievable.The novel's hook is that it paralleled a modern murder investigation with a historical examination of one of Brigham Young's more rebellious wives. 'The 19th Wife' benefits tremendously with the casting of Patricia Wettig (Thirtysomething) as a compound wife charged with murdering her husband. Unfortunately the film actually centers around Chyler Leigh (Grey's Anatomy) a young progressive who sets out to prove Wettig's innocence. Enlisting her childhood friend and Wettig's son Matt Czuchry (The Good Wife Gilmore Girls) the two start to unravel the truths of the case and deal with unresolved feelings of betrayal and resentment. Wettig does well as you might expect and Czuchry is appropriately bitter having been cast out as a boy--but they are by far the best things about the movie. Leigh is the single most unbelievable representative of a polygamist sect ever put on film. Raised on the principle she is so extraordinarily modern and free--at home to openly disregard any aspect of the lifestyle that inconveniences the plot. Oh it made my head hurt!By itself though it's an interesting enough story even if the final revelations lack a bit of conviction. But the film also tries to incorporate the Brigham Young aspect into the plot by having Leigh read the elicit diary of a woman ahead of her time. At about 95 minutes it is really just too little time to represent either story very effectively. This is where fans of the novel are likely to be up-in-arms the story really becomes a skeleton of the complexities you might have admired about the book! Surprisingly I'm still going to give this a nominal recommendation only for Wettig's fans--we don't see her often enough and she can't be held guilty for the sins of this unremarkable TV movie.

" This has the makings of a decent crime thriller but it gets overdone in the storyline. Cash shows he's an actor in this as the sociopathic Johnny Talon. I also feel Vic(Mel Sharples)Tayback did a great performance in this as Fred his partner. This is an odd couple indeed but there's nothing to laugh at here. Fred hires Johnny to hold up a bank and the catch is they take the vice president's wife which Johnny does and Fred does the hold-up. There's one catch though and that's the vice-president doesn't care as he's about ready to run off with his mistress. Cash not only does a impressive acting job but he actually shows off his guitar abilities here and he's actually good. Unfortunately this had some moments that were overdone like where the woman Priscilla keeps calling the vice-president's house to speak to his wife and then there was little Ronnie Howard as thier little boy who makes it home just in time bringing the police with him. I found the ending too predictable not like in 'Jeopardy' where Barbara Stanwyck convinces an bank robber to help her husband as he's caught under a fishing pier and when he frees her husband she lets him escape. I feel the soundtrack was good Cash was good and so was Tayback but the storyline was overdone by about 15 minutes. Wait till Walmart sells this for a buck. ",2.0

" We've connected two TiVos (one TiVo HD and one TiVo Premiere) to our wireless network using these adapters and the performance has been lackluster at best. While it's perfectly fine for retrieving guide data and talking with the TiVo mother ship most any other connections it can make falter at times. This isn't an issue with actual signal strength connection with a wireless network per se but with actual bandwidth and throughput.The 'Wireless G' protocol is capable of 54Mbps which is more bandwidth than most people have coming into their home via their ISP. That said I don't see how this wireless adapter moves anywhere near that much.When using Netflix transferring videos between boxes or downloading content from Music Choice the data speeds are remarkably SLOW. I don't have raw numbers but I can tell you that transferring a 1-hour HD program between TiVos takes more than 1 hour -- and that's between two boxes that both register very good signal strength with the wireless router! Netflix movies regularly have to rebuffer while using this adapter. (Please note that we have several other devices in our house that have no problem holding onto a Netflix stream via our 6Mbps DSL connection.)The problems stated above were all generally relieved when we recently changed our TiVo Premiere's connection to a wired one though box-to-box transfers are still bottlenecked by the TiVo HD's wireless adapter.If you buy this adapter realize that you will NOT get anywhere close to 54Mbps.

" I have two older Series 2 Tivos. I had bought these units in order to allow TV show transfers between the two units over the wireless network. Unfortunately the two units won't do this - the explanation I have gotten is that the units take too long to get the info from each other and they 'time out' and that Tivo is hoping to work out some software patches (according to Tivo discussion boards). Have also noticed that my older Tivos run sluggish with these wireless units which the website also shows to be a common problem. When you switch channels it takes about 10 seconds of the image looking delayed and sluggish before it plays properly. However in regards to connecting with Tivo for updating programming information it is much faster than dial up. Set up was also a pain in the neck as it did not work right out of the box for me as other posters have said. There was a lot of trial and error before I was able to get each unit to actually connect to the network. Instructions and Tivo customer support webpage could be improved. So if you have an older Tivo which is getting its programming over a phone line without problems I would not suggest wasting time with this product. Tivo worked better before I bought these things.

" Belle Starr (1848-89) was the first of the female outlaws and even to this date more than a century and a half later she heads a very short list (e.g. Ma Barker and Bonnie Parker). Her story was popularized in dime novels beginning in 1889 and in films beginning in 1928. She was played by Betty Compson in 'Court Martial' (1928) Gene Tierney in 'Belle Starr' (1941) Isabel Jewell in 'Badman's Territory' (1946) Elizabeth Montgomery in 'Belle Starr' (1980) and Pamela Reed in 'The Long Riders' (1980).If most of her films did not do justice to her real life 'Montana Belle' is the worst offender with the only bare facts of her name her marriage to Sam Starr and his death prior to hers. Otherwise this is merely a traditional 40s oat burner more about the Dalton Gang than about Belle Starr.Of course it's not a total waste. No film with beautiful Jane Russell can be a total loss and Jane gets a chance to do two musical numbers. Jane Russell (1921-2011) made her screen debut in 'Outlaw' (1941) and went on to make nearly two dozen films including 'Paleface' (1948) with Bob Hope 'Double Dynamite' (1951) with Sinatra and Groucho 'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes' (1953) with Marilyn Monroe and 'Gentlemen Marry Brunettes' (1956). She's OK is this one and her voice is pretty good although her dancing leaves a lot to be desired.The film features Scott Brady as Bob Dalton Forrest Tucker and Jack Lambert as members of his gang Andy Devine as a sleazy traitor and George Brent as a businessman who falls in love with Jane.Scott Brady (1924-85) specialized in playing tough guys in more than 100 films and TV shows. I liked him best as 'The Dancin Kid' in 'Johnny Guitar'Forrest Tucker (1919-86) is best known from TV's 'F Troop' (1965-7) but he was a prolific film actor in the 40s and 50s frequently appearing in westerns ('The Westerner' 'Gunfighters' 'The Nevadan') and war films ('Submarine Raider' 'Sands of Iwo Jima' 'Fighting Coast Guard').Andy Devine (1905-77) made over 400 films include several with John Wayne ('Stagecoach' 'Liberty Valance') but perhaps is best remembered as Guy Madison's sidekick in TVs 'The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickock' (1951 - 1958).Handsome George Brent (1899-1979) is best known as the frequent co-star with Bette Davis in 13 films although he was also very close with Garbo. His memorable films include 'Dark Victory' (1939) and 'The Spiral Staircase' (1945).Jack Lambert (1920-2002) plays a half breed named Ringo. Lambert is one of those actors whose face you've seen dozens of times but whose name you never knew. He appeared in over 50 films (e.g. 'Dick Tracy's Dilemma' 'Vera Cruz') prior to turning his attention to TV where he usually played a cowboy appearing in episodes of 'Gunsmoke' 'Daniel Boone' 'Bonanza' etc.Director Allan Dwan (1885-1981) made more than 400 films most of them in the silent era. He's best known for 'Heidi' (1937) 'Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farms' (1938) and 'Sands of Iwo Jima' (1949). He did several film noir including 'Slightly Scarlet' (1956) and 'Surrender' (1950) but was more versed in the western - 'Cattle Queen of Montana' (1954) 'The Restless Breed' (1957) 'Silver Lode' (1954) etc.The NY Times called it 'the most overstated Western of the year' and said that Russell was 'beginning to look saddlesore.'The film was actually made in 1948 but not released until 1952. The top grossing films in 1952 were 'The Greatest Show on Earth' 'The Bad and the Beautiful' 'The Snows of Kilimanjaro' 'Ivanhoe' and 'Singing in the Rain'. 'The Greatest Show on Earth' won for Best Picture and other Oscar winners were 'High Noon' (Actor) 'The Quiet Man' (Director) 'Come Back Little Sheeba' (Actress) and 'Viva Zapata' (Supporting Actor). Other memorable films that year were 'Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd' Tracy and Hepburn as 'Pet and Mike' Fritz Lang's 'Rancho Nororious' 'The Red Planet Mars' 'Scaramouche' and Marian Cooper's 'This is Cinerama'.Bottom line - not much here to appreciate but fans of Jane Russell will enjoy it nonetheless.

" I agree that the book is a egocentered blurt that only was successful b/c of the popularity of 'Everest' stories. I can easily imagine her friends and husband 'Oh Ruth Anne you really MUST write your book...' Of course the ghost author was limited by her journal and interviews I hope he was well paid. I have climbed all the mountains she writes about (and more) with women as equals and Ruth Anne's story is incredible in its simplistic vision of 'women' and 'mountains'. I agree that she slights her climbing partners deifies the guides (hey nice guys I know them by reputation) but she is yet another 'drone' with a big enough check book to 'climb' the mountain.

" I thoroughly enjoyed the book! It was quick paced and gripping. The problem was when I put it down... I felt sour -- like I'd been cooped up on a mountain with a bunch of bumbling idiots for three weeks... That was what stuck with me... Could that have been the whole point of the book??? To convey that??? Wasn't there something more important to convey? Like Kocour's experience with the mountain or more importantly with herself? I wonder if she feels sour still... ",2.0
" What an amazing accomplishment! I wish she could had written the book better! I admire mountaineers but this book was frustrating to read. She sounds so arrogant in this and just not a nice person. I can understand being on a team with some annoying or inexperienced people but that is the chance you take being part of a team. If she didn't want to listen to someone talk all the time or deal with someone that didn't have her experience she should have hired a private guide to take her up the mountain. She always mentioned her compliments and her achievements and how she triumphed eventhough she was a girl-and how the guys on the team would make comments- OH PLEASE. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. If you want a really good book read Into thin Air or Seven Summits. ",2.0
" This is an as-told-to tale of enduring a ferocious storm for almost two weeks on North America's highest peak Mt. Denali (Mt. McKinley). It is a tale worth telling for Denali while not a technically difficult mountain to climb is known for the worst storms on earth. The first problem is Ms. Kocour's exaggerations and misinformation diminishes the very story she wants to tell.The second problem is Ms. Kocour herself. Her own words make her sound like an arrogant bigotedself-satisfied braggart. Her lack of charity toward her teammates and fellow climbers is breathtakingly insensitive. She has a fawning regard for her professional guides and an almost girlish awe of chance meetings with elite climbers Jim Wickwire and John Roskelley but a rare good word for her fellow amateurs.The author continually refers to being trapped in the 'Death Zone' a height where humans cannot acclimate to the altitude and the human body deteriorates. This 'Zone' is above 26246 feet. The camp where the author was stranded was 8000 feet below this extreme. To give a comparison Everest's base camp (the beginning of the climb) is higher than the camp at which Ms. Kocour was stranded. The entire route her party took has fixed lines and they were roped to their guides at all times during their climb. It was not what anyone would call an intrepid daring ascent. The 'ledge' where her team bivouacked accommodated six tents a ranger hut and a large medical station more resembling a mall parking lot than a ledge.The descriptions of the storm are good and it is easy to imagine the fear the claustrophobia and the boredom of being confined to such close quarters in the monstrous elements for such an extended period of time. It is a cautionary tale for anyone who thinks Denali is a walk in the park. It is not.I awarded the second star for Ruth Anne's self-portrayal of a lady you'd love to see get her comeuppance. Makes you want to see a book by one of her teammates describing the trials and tribulations of climbing with Ruth Anne. ",2.0
" I've been immersed in books of this genre in preparation for a class I'm planning to teach and I have to say that this was one of the most annoying. Yes the description of the storm and the deaths of other climbers is harrowing but gosh. Ruth Anne is so impressed with herself that it's hard to get past her self-descriptions and appreciate the narrative. The others on her team (with the exception of her tentmate and the guides) are all unworthy of being there. The other teams on the mountain are all unworthy of being there. Everyone is either foolish obnoxious a danger to others or just plain weak. But not Ruth Anne. She is the best climber the best most supportive tentmate the most patient teammate. At the end she quotes one of the guides as saying 'I'd climb with you anywhere.' Maybe he would but such self-serving comments are a distraction. As a comparison read Roskelley's Nanda Devi. Equally harrowing but Roskelley has no qualms about portraying himself as arrogant and impatient and one can see how his presence on a team can be destructive. I wish Ruth Anne had been a bit more scrutinizing of herself. Or maybe she really is a mountaineering saint. ",2.0

" This is a review of the 9th edition. Please note that amazon has included this review for other editions as well. That is okay because I have something to say about them too but you should be aware. The really old editions are probably out of copyright.I would not recommend this book unless you are into the 'history of technical analysis'. The focus of the book is classical patterns of bar charts. The book is absolutely not bad but it's value is a bit dubious. Why read a book that have charts that are 1/2 century old? You can't be sure that things haven't changed can you? So the newer editions also have more modern charts. However this combination of old and new makes for a frustrating reading. Actually I would think most book deteriorate in quality after their 3rd edition.If you want a classic in your bookself I would really recommend you to buy a second-hand copy of the last edition written by Edwards & Magee alone. This would be the 5th edition. It has a very professional binding and clear white pages. The new edition is a very ugly and cheaply bound hardcover.

" The book is a reprint of a much older book. Since the original book was written there have been a number of significant advances in computing power and software and this book is very much dated. ",2.0
" Written in the 20's this book is at least five decades ahead of its time discussing detailedly about Dow Theory chart patterns volume support and resistance etc in the demand and supply context at a time whilst most people focused solely on company/accounting data specific fundamental analysis. However though market psychology doesnt change technology and the speed and means of information distribution do leading to shorter business cycles and thus trends inevitably attacking the weakest link of the Dow Theory which is that confirmation of the primary and long term trend almost always come too late. The situation is even worse in that 'traps' in trend following are so frequent in today's highly competitive market when power traders with the help of deteriatives fully exploit the stop loss orders of mass investors.I dont mean to undermine the value of this book. Nevertheless considering the high price of the book and the long time to read it through there are many alternatives that cover TA wider and deeper. This book can be a very exhaustive reference book in chart patterns. It just cannot provide a compeat course on TA. The new appendix of MACD Stochastics etc is adequate but far from sufficient. Afterall TA is just a tool for money making. There's no point not to take a more productive route to achieve the goal. ",2.0

The game isn't worthless just not on par with Gamewright's usual flair and definitely developmentally geared toward younger children.

" With 'Wiretap Scars' Sparta prooved they can still proceed even after the break-up of ATDI. Their combination of moody ambience and pulsating guitar riffs were quite fascinating at the time. Unfortunately though it's been two years since and I really don't know if I care anymore or maybe it's because I've already heard one-too-many bands duplicating this forumla right down to the point where it has become overly-bland.The album opens off with 'Guns in Memorial Park' not a bad song after a U2-inspired opening the song actually begins featuring a catchy chorus and guitar work that is pretty much Sparta. 'Oceana Sleeps' is another good song beautiful suffice to say but sadly the only promising note on an otherwise album full of banality.When I look back at it The Mars Volta were progressive side of ATDI whereas Sparta were the harder sector. But sometimes I wonder instead of all this nonsense both bands should just merge and rightfully bring back one of the best Amerian bands of the past 10 years.Then again maybe it's been so long who cares anymore. As for 'Porcelain' it just didn't nab the attention of my ears and lacked a truly good song (At least Wiretap had 'Red Alibi' and 'Cut your Ribbon') to make it worth the purchase.

" The movie was a highly anticipated portrayal of Whitley Strieber's experiences written about in his NY Times bestseller 'Communion'. It starts out with an excellent first half introducing the viewer to Whitley and his family the famous cabin and some of Whitley's friends. Those who have read the book will be right at home here. The scenes dealing with recreating his experiences both in real time as well as hypnotically regressed flashback are quite compelling and will likely frighten many viewers. At the very least they provide a solid framework for the powerful and puzzling emotions Whitley experiences as a result of the encounters. Where the book excelled and the movie fizzled is in the area of 'What is this all about...? as Whitley left a lot of room for speculation in his writing and yet the movie provides an obscure or confusing possible look at what the 'Visitors' really may be. If the viewer has read some of Whitley's other Communion related works and especially focuses on his many statements that the enigmatic Visitors may not be at all what we think they are much of the theatrical symbolism starts to make sense. However for those who are wondering what this is all about I'm afraid to say that the movie really won't satisfy. ",2.0

It dwells on the popularity of communism at that time and its failed promises often reminding me of 'Animal Farm'. Overall as a book and as a novel I found it uninteresting and difficult to read. There are too many irrelevant characters such as Jill and Geoffrey; the timeline is sometime very slow sometimes very fast sometimes skipping several years at once; some major events take only some paragraphs while other more trivial ones take several pages; and the focus of the book shifts from one character to another to Sylvia. It definitely lacks a storyline that gives cohesion and life to the book it lacks drama suspense romance... and it left me wondering what was the book title all about. ",2.0
" The Mayor of Casterbridge was a very interesting novel. In my opinion Hardy uses too much irony and this kills the fun of the whole topic. It is true that every day is filled with irony but it shouldn't be in somthing someone is reading. the novel also shouldn't be too predictable I guess that's why Hardy likes irony. If you are a reader who likes suspense and tragedy then this book is for you. ",2.0
" This book is similar to a Dickens novel in that it seeks not to reach perfection but to please its audience at the time. Like Dickens it is very dry and filled with hard to believe coincidences that make the story hard to swallow. Still Hardy paints a very lively realistic and flowing impression of the English countryside in the early days before the industrial revolution. I would recommend this only if you are obsessed with Hardy if you have run out of books to read (try Fifth Business by Robertson Davies) or if you are forced to read this as a part of some course.

" Noble's book is best summarized as 'frightening' and 'far out.' Her thoughts on twinship experiences in utero sound like something out of the X-Files; her warnings against the evils of consuming dairy products and foods containing preservatives are pure paranoia; and the gorey details of multiple pregnancy hazards are nothing short of terrifying. In fact the positive aspects of having twins are completely ignored. The only redeeming quality of this book would be the last 3-4 chapters dealing with prematurity and dealing with loss. However this same content can be found in many other less frightening and definitely more positive books such as 'Twins!' by Agnew Klein and Ganon. ",2.0
" This was the first book that I bought when I found out that I was expecting twins and I found it to be outdated and full of a lot of biased information. The author has her own thoughts about what type of diet you should eat and advocates natural childbirth but doesn't provide a very comprehensive point of view to assist those that may not want to experience childbirth the way that she has. If you share her views then this book will be very helpful to you.I also tried contacting a lot of resources at the back of the book and found most of the numbers to be disconnected. ",2.0

Adaptec has some crazy requirements for a power supply (12V 2.1A) and used to offer one that fit them through their store but apparently no longer do! Without the adapter this unit is only usable for items that draw almost no power through the USB or 1394 connection - which is a shame because the Adaptec 1394 implementation was always the most stable on my machines. Look for one that includes an AC adapter or some other way of bringing power to the unit instead. ",2.0
" I have been a fan of R. Kelly for a long time and when I heard that TP-2 was coming out I could not wait especially after hearing the remarkable 'I Wish' and 'To the Homies That We Lost'. At first it seemed like this was going to be a great album with the interesting arrangement of 'Strip For You' but I was dissapointed by the next five tracks since they were quite mediocre and overly repetitious. Many critics have said the R. Kelly is a little repetitive but I never really agreed until hearing these songs. 'Fiesta was nice' the guitar a little remeniscent of 'Did You Ever Think' for 'R'. 'The Real R. Kelly' was funny at first but not enough to save the somewhat boring 'One Me'. At last we came to a nice stretch 'I Wish' 'I Decided' 'To The Homies That We Lost' 'All I Really Want' 'Feelin' On Yo Booty' and 'The Storm Is Over'. Sadly these tracks are still not enough to save this album. Even the photography of a more thuggish-looking R. Kelly were no way as good as the classy material used in the 'R' liner notes. On another note I read recently a review by someone saying that R Kelly's on a downward spiral into thuggery. I feel that R always had that thug persona bubbling at the surface and I feel that it should not interfere with his music but if I discovered that it is the cause of this mediocre album I would be most disappointed.Honestly I would recommend that you do NOT buy this album and instead invest in 'R'. It has a much better mix and of a higher class. 'R' is still one of my favourite albums after many years of listening. If you really like the singles such as I Wish and Feelin' On Yo Booty (really good remix) purchase them instead and ignore this album. That may give R the message that he should rethink his strategy.

" R Kelly actually got me into listening to cool romantic melodious black music. His past albums followed a style typical to only him. However TP-2.com got me wondering whether he is losing touch to his unique style or whether he is just trying to prove he can also do what others are doing. Either way it is a pity because the album didn't reflect his identity. It is not a CD worth buying even if you are a fanatic fan of R Kelly. ",2.0
" This is a very disappointing release. I'm sure R. Kelly worked hard on this release but the lack of content of the songs written on this album is disturbing. The production while clear is uninspiring. 'I Wish' is the only gem on this album.This effort is reminisent of the 1994 album 12 Play. However 12 Play (94') release is loaded with heavy bass and catchy tunes. TP-2.com is an album for the 'fans'. Unfortunately fans are willing to accept anything these day. After the 1998 release 'R' Kelly showed everyone that he is a skilled songwritter and producer. TP-2.com leaves you with one question what happened between to Kelly? ",2.0

" What has happened to R.Kelly? Too many collaborations with guest rappers perhaps?How tiring it is to see yet ANOTHER young talent waste it on singing nothing but soft porn dressed up and masquerading as 'sensitive' love songs.This album is a far cry from his second which although had switched focus from the bedroom to the dance floor at least contained some innovative future funk and slinky friday night beats.While by now we are all familiar with Kelly's over-the-top self-indulgent style his last two albums have gone far even by his standars - this album seems to want to go in 10 directions all at once with no clear focus. One second he talks of bit**es and h*'s and in the next breath they become his ladies. One minute he's a shy boy calling mama for direction in life and the next he's a thug who's only concern is a 'bling bling' lifestyle.Kelly gets two stars only because of his showing his potential in earlier works and his excellent work as a producer.

" FIRST OFF let me say that I am not a big R. Kelly fan so all you devotees out there can skip my review. When R. Kelly first came on the scene I was in a whole different music listening group (born before 1970) and therefore I listened to his songs on the radio with mild interest.Some songs really caught both my ear and my heart (I Believe I can Fly I Wish). Others made me wonder if this man had any children (all his sex laden knockin' boots songs). But always I knew I had a choice of supporting his efforts (buying the CD) or not (not buying his CD's). Well nearly a decade after he hit I decided to buy. Why? Because I kept on hearing this song on all my local radio stations and there was a hook 'playa's got to play balla's got to ball' that had me singing along everytime I heard it.Knowing how much of a fan I wasn't and without actually knowing the name of that song I went to my local record store in search of the single release hoping I could find out the name and get the song for a few bucks. Needless the say the store clerk did not have any single cd release for R. Kelly and even as I stood at the counter singing the hook she didn't know what song it was. She suggested I call the radio stations when I heard it but I decided to ask my niece (she's 17). When she told me the name of the song 'Feeling on Yo Booty' I found myself ashamed for even liking it but like I said that hook... So I went back to the record store scanned the titles on the CD and saw that it most of the titles suggested getting sex or having sex. But I was getting ready to make a personal tape and despite my reservations I wanted 'Feeling On Yo Booty' as one of those songs. I loved the 'hook' that much. So I purchased it.Before I played a single cut I read the available lyrics. With young children I had to make certain that the songs were clean enough for my 9 year old to hear. I found two",2.0

In the case of familiar much recorded historical instruments such as the magnificent Freiberg Silbermann organ it is easy to compare.

They do this through intimidation and violence. When a couple of friends get hold of a claim they put together a plan to secure that claim and those of the rest of the town from the bad guys. To do this they enlist the aide of a traveling circus to serve as a distraction. They yell they fight they wrestle they shoot and then they do it some more. Its not very exciting cinema.This production is made worse by the DVD. I suspect that the original film was a rather low budget affair. The DVD however is of such low quality that who could really tell? The edges are clipped off the transfer is grainy and the effect is of someone holding a hidden handycam in a theater trying to bootleg it. IT was not worth the effort.Spaghetti westerns can be fun.

Directing OK but film shows its age and circus scenario will be too exotic for many tastes. Some viewers will find the film more dull than moody or stylish (as the director seemed to intend).

I will assume that certain professionals such as those in marketing or sales or executives giving a presentation to the board of directors might need this level of specialization but I find little useful in the book.

Weak.This was like the time I saw the 'Blair Witch Project' and was puzzled when the characters kept wandering around in circles. I'm an urbanite and still I kept thinking 'Why don't you just follow the river back?'

Then this is your novel. This book is bad but it has some good qualities. The second book (the city) however is just more of the same and worse. I'm 100 pages into The City and I feel like a chump for giving this publisher more of my money. In both books there has been the introduction of more than a hundred characters and out of all of them not one is going on a zombie killing rampage.Autumn doesn't compare to other great zombie adventures like Day By Day Armageddon or Tooth and Nail.This is one story that isn't worth the time or money.

That being said.... the characters were hateful. Nothing redeeming whatsoever.

In general I like post-apocalyptic survivor stories (I Am Legend Year Zero The Stand) but I was also influenced by positive comments from readers. Which goes to show that book reviews -- as well as books -- are best left to professionals.'Autumn' is not slow moving in terms of events but it is plodding. The writing is so amateurish it leaves me wondering if 'Infected Books' the publisher is a vanity press. The paperback itself is printed with a cheap-looking typeface in a fairly large print.Occasional chapters are narrated in first-person point of view from one or another of the several main characters but since there is no discernible difference in their voice or tone this just seems silly. Not only are the characters barely distinguishable they are also inarticulate and unsympathetically drawn and the dialogue is tediously repetitious basically",2.0
" David Moody has written a hyper-realistic apocalyptic zombie survival thriller - not simply a knock off text of popular zombie movies but a strongly character driven book.Three Characters who are so obtuse and dull and written in the same first person voice as to be indistinguishable from either each other or the 3rd party intermittent narrator.Virtually nothing happens in this book - sure most of humanity is wiped out and eventually rises in mass - but readers know how that goes; getting a hyper realistic look into the psyche of three nearly identical characters isn't that interesting - and certainly doesn't warrant 200 pages.Maybe as an American reader I expect more from both my zombie thriller and its protagonists than several trips to the grocery store lots of soup being consumed and one brief chapter of massed zombies at the barricades.

" I read this the first book. I admit I haven't read the rest of the series but I don't really feel a need to. The book doesn't really stand on its own since almost nothing happens and the book isn't that interesting to begin with.A mysterious force kills everyone in England but re-animates some of the dead. Those who survived find themselves lost and aimless in a decaying world. At first the story focuses on a group of survivors but then three of them leave their fragile retreat and find a deserted farm where they try to survive.As other reviewers pointed out the zombies don't become dangerous until halfway through the book. The book isn't too badly-written with three compelling characters (although with vague backgrounds) but the book spends more time dealing with their despair at the dead world than anything else. There are endless scenes where the characters literally do nothing but sit around contemplating the hopelessness of their existence. They encounter the zombies a few times but most of their encounters involve pushing the zombies away.Since the heroes find a sanctuary almost immediately there's not much of a threat. I'm not saying there's not room for a story dealing with the psychological aspects of a zombie story but there needs to be something else for them to do. I also was confused by why they gave up on life so quickly. There was never a scene where they confirmed that *everyone* in England was killed. Couldn't it have been a local phenomenon? And they never bothered to check to see whether it was a worldwide disaster. The characters immediately came to the conclusion that civilization had ended and life was over. Unrealistic and that shut off what could have been a compelling story.There are geniunely well-written and frightening scenes but those are too few and far-between. Maybe the other novels get more in-depth but I think the author should have given us more in the first book. As it is the events of 'Autumn' could have filled five or six chapters and gotten to the good stuff. And for the record this book was indeed self-published. ",2.0
" Most zombie stories begin the same way. Take a random ordinary day; add a mysterious plague that kills a great percentage of the population; focus on a handful of survivors as they seek each other out and come to terms with the fact that their loved ones are now flesh-eating undead. I really don't see the need for re-writing the classic Night of the Living Dead gig unless there's a new (or at least interesting) twist to it. Like 28 Days Later where the never-identified-as-zombies 'Infected' have a very different sort of affliction and even Shaun of the Dead with its comic twist. Autumn sadly offers nothing new or exciting in its story.True to the genre formula the book begins with an ordinary autumn day turned gruesome as people begin to asphyxiate and literally drop dead leaving very few survivors. By the end of the next day half of the bodies 'wake up' and start walking around aimlessly. And then they start reacting to sound and light... And then they start attacking the living... Not really all that suspenseful if you've ever seen a zombie flick.But that's ok that's what makes it a horror story. Author David Moody (if he - a horror writer - was actually born with that last name it would be a crazy coincidence) still has a chance to wow me with his writing skills and characterization. We can look into the human condition; we can sympathize with the characters and bite our nails when it looks like they have no way out. We can be mentally transported to the cottage in which the survivors huddle and feel part of the story. At the very least since it is a horror story after all we can be supremely grossed out.Or not.Moody's writing is disappointingly amateurish and repetitive (if I read the phrase 'unexpected and inexplicable' one more time I would have slammed my head into a wall). His descriptions are flat and the characters are mind-numbingly dull. We skim the surface of them - age sex occupation - but never delve into what they are feeling.

Come on? There were other options that was sort of teased but never attempted by the characters. And there's absolutely zero explanation as to why the outbreak happened and why some folks survived. I eagerly read the book - just to get over with it so I could begin another zombie thriller. I probably will read Moody's next attempt. And I was thinking about watching the movie but the reviews on Netflix are absolutely hilarious - hilariously bad. I think the reviews might be more entertaining than the actual film. ",2.0
" This was not a story of zombies and barely a story of the undead. Not to give away too much of the plot but the bulk of the story centered around a small group of survivors - not so much as how they struggled to survive against the zombies as much as about how bored and lost they were and how they missed their former lives. The story is well written - no doubt about that - but there is simply not enough here unless you like to read a lot of whining. Any real plot advances are crushed as they plummet into their own set of whining.98% of the conflict in this book is internal to each character as each character struggles with survivor's guilt and if/how they are going to move forward. Is life really worth living with 99% of the population dead and some of those 're-animated'? Would my (now dead) family want me to keep going? How are we going to live? Where are we going to live? Are we just going to 'survive' while we hide from the re-anmiated creatures? You are asked these questions again and again and again and about the fourth time the characters ask the question you almost start to wish they would get attacked or something to spare them and yourself more of the half-hearted mental 'anguish' that quickly devolves into just more whining.You don't really get 'zombies' until perhaps the last 15-20 pages and despite the writing you never quite feel the -desperation and fear that the author should have been trying to instill. The 'zombies' are terrifying more the way a freight train would be terrifying if you were near the tracks as the train approached. There is no malevolence no eating flesh no hunting humans - really very few moments of excitement and absolutely no chills. In the end there is nothing thrilling about the climax and even less about the rest of the book. ",2.0

" I had been eyeing David Moody's 'Autumn' trilogy for a while now and happened to come across all three books in my local used book shop. I couldn't pass up the deal so I purchased all three.'Autumn' the first in the series concerns a zombie apocalypse where about 98% of the world population just up and dies. The story that we're told concerns twenty or so survivors in a small English village. The survivors hole up in an old community center and watch as the dead rise. At first the dead are harmless but as the days pass become more aggressive and eventually downright deadly. Hilarity ensues.The plot focuses on three of these survivors two men and a woman none of whom are what I would call 'likeable'. Moody's characterization is very thin and the characters are constantly doing and saying things that no normal person regardless of the stress of the situation would ever do or say. Our three 'heroes' tire of the situation at the community center and through some vague rationalization decide to set out on their own. They head out into the countryside and suffer through some less than thrilling adventures and eventually find a farmhouse out in the middle of Nowheresville England. They set up shop but unfortunately for them the zombies find them.The books reads quickly but not because its necessarily interesting but moreso because of its amateurishness. Characterization is attempted(one guy misses his dead family another is tough on the outside but a real softie on the inside etc.)but shows that Moody is no Stephen King.

The one with the most depth became dull as the author reminded us again and again of the character's driving force.A lot of the prose was beating the dead dog. Anytime someone came up with a proactive idea there were pages upon pages of argument. The point when I felt the characters should have argued they didn't causing plenty of problems and ultimately forcing them from their safe haven.The initial few chapters in which everyone died had me on edge. They were that awesome. The shell shocked survivors that came after that well let's just say that their elevators no longer went to the top floor.The zombies oh the zombies. There wasn't even really a zombie until a good quarter of the way through the book.

Scenes involving them varied from nail biting to dull.I'm torn as to if I'm going to attempt to continue the series.

" I borrowed this book in hard-copy form from a friend. The regular book is great. It is written in an easily digestible manner while still covering the material in surprising depth. I found the use of figures and illustrations to summarize concepts particularly well executed. I was incredibly disappointed by the Kindle version I bought for use on my Kindle DX. The text looked like it had been scanned from a copy of a copy made on an old xerox machine. Parts of the letters in the text were missing and the general appearance of the text was blurry. The figures did not line up with the text well and their quality was not good. I want to make a switch to buying textbooks on the kindle. But if the other book conversions are as poorly executed as this one then I will stick to buying used hard copies. I would rate the hard copy as a 4 or 5 star book but I have to give the kindle version a 2 for the lackluster conversion. ",2.0

" With Play Moby has demonstrated in spades his musical talents by taking multiple influences and mixing them into a single album. I love the 'idea' of what he was going for but the product seems lacking. For some this will be far from true. Each song is well constructed with a good rythym that makes you want to 'play' but the cacophany of ambient style music back to back with 'techno-rap' doesn't work for me. Give me an album of rap or an album of ambient and I'll pick and choose; but together it feels like I've put Vivaldi and the Beastie Boys in my player and hit the shuffle button. ",2.0
" It's a moderately good dance record with a couple of stand-out tracks. It's nowhere near as good or as ground-breaking as 'Everything Is Wrong'. It's sample overload. It's a unfocused.

" What a disappointment! I had high hopes for this CD after I heard 'Ambient' which was my first introduction to Moby and was sonically and compositionally very satisfying. I had downloaded some tracks from 'Play' such as 'Porcelain' and 'Down Slow' (from the big bad Napster) and was very exited about getting the entire CD. Sonically this CD is a nuclear waste zone.This is one of the worst recorded albums I have heard since the 70's. It is as though it was done on a home computer with a Sound Blaster sound card in the basement of a suburban home (maybe it was!) or a cheap 4 track mixer onto a two track cassette deck. What a waste of wonderful talented compositions by one of the most talented musician/composer of our times which unfortunately is filled with virtual pop/techno overload. But this is unacceptably in a period where there is such a great amount of high-resolution recording techniques and experienced recording engineers are available to all musicians. I listen with high-resolution sound reproduction equipment and expect no less from the signal encoded on the media.This recording has a vast assortment of annoying imperfections that spoil the entire listening experience. Most of the low frequency is distorted. Some tracks have very noticeable HSSSSSSS...in the background. (I could accept this if I though it was an effect that was intended to enhance the recording in some way but on three or four tracks?). There is also some sort of machine running in the background on several tracks that remind me of a cooling fan on a rack mounted amplifier...Ambience? Please don't take me wrong this is some of the most innovative music I have heard in quite some time but lets face it both the composition and the recording quality have to fit together to make a satisfying and truly great statement to the listening public.There is no substitute for the use of all the modern recording engineer's bag of tricks and sophisticated equipment on offer in their studios that's specifically designed to take advantage of the wonderful digital technology available today. I should have just kept the compressed mp3 versions and not wasted $14 on the CD because there's not much difference. ",2.0
" Initial I loved this CD but it didn't last. Soon the tracks started to grate and seem just a to predictable and calculated. Maybe I'm being unfair I am comparing to Leftfields Leftism which still sounds original and fresh 6 years on. Compared to them Moby is twiddling in the sandpit. ",2.0

" I do not understand why Moby's music is always placed in the 'techno' section. For those of you looking for some high energy up-beat electronic music this is not the CD to buy. Upon first listening to Play I was shocked. The whole CD is incredibly bland. Most of the music has very little keyboards in it at all. Play belongs more in the R&B or even Easy Listening category than anywhere else. In addition to the mellow music the samples thrown in everywhere are repetitive and annoying at times. If you are in the mood for something slower and different though...you may want to give Play a listen. There are a few tracks that are OK if you like Ambient/Contemporary music but it's still not enough to warrant a purchase in my opinion. ",2.0
" This is one of the most boring albums I've ever heard. I've read some of the reviews and this is not even close to techno/trance/electronica. Not only that but most of the album wasn't even done by Moby. It's old recycled stuff with a bassline and drum beats spliced in. It does have its redeeming songs like Porcelain Natural Blues and the radio-friendly Bodyrock but on the whole this is NOT the album its been hyped up to be. ",2.0
" 'Play' is a collage of gospel samples mixed with some beginner-level piano work (think of the piano on 'New Year's Day' by U2 and you have a rough idea of the technical level of Moby's keyboard work) some percussion and bass tracks with some corny lyrics thrown in. Surprisingly it works. I found myself humming along and tapping my foot.But this work ultimately lacks imagination and this is its main weakness. Remember the bins of used CD's by bands like Live or Crash Test Dummies? Yeah they were very popular bands and wrote catchy tunes and sold lots of CDs. In the true flash-in-the-pan tradition advertisers have licensed Moby's tracks exactly because they are so catchy. But when you listen to this album the tunes don't last a merciful 30 seconds like they do on TV. Instead they last minutes some of those minutes being very long.So though this album holds some initial interest it holds up poorly to repeated play making the listener switch to other CDs like 'Future Sounds of Jazz Vol-5' (with 20 artists most of them more talented than Moby) or Kruder and Dorfmeister or Amon Tobin or We or... you get the idea. Moby didn't invent the art form of sampling and mixing and many others have come up with more interesting ideas and better music. I'm not talking about far-out experimental music either. I mean that there are people who laid down the groundwork and put together very listenable music that doesn't get worn out after 3 sessions of digital to analog conversion.Buy this album only if you like safe pop tunes with a kind of DJ feel to them. Even then you may tire of 'Play.' If you are looking for illbient trance or acid jazz you may find yourself returning your Moby CD to the local record store where it will take its place on a rack with all the other pre-owned copies of 'Play.'

" All my friends were raveing on about this album and I'd heard some of the tracks which had an instant appeal to me so I parted with my hard earned cash and bought it. After a few listens the novelty factor began to wear off. The level of musical skill in this album seems to be quite basic and the chord structures are lacking a complexity that makes songs stand out in your memory. It doesn't really hang together as an album aswell. It is varied (which is not a bad thing) but in this case it just doesn't seem to work. This coupled with the fact that moby's liner notes in the album are pretentious and preachy makes for a dissapointing buy. The album is not without it's credit where credit's due of course. 'Run on' fuses trad jazz vocal harmony with modern dance beats in a nice way and 'porcelain' has a wonderful backwards string sample which is really distinctive. I would recomend this album to people who like songs from adverts and tina turner (their chord progressions are similar in case you were searching for a link there) and not to musicians or people who like 'albums' rather than particular tracks. 'Play' has the potential to contain many epic tracks but unfortunately they seem to be lacking one final ingredient to make them great. Just be warned. ",2.0

It is 18 tracks of piano slow beats and 70s 'wawaah' guitars. There is no life in this ablum. Now I know why he was jumping on the cover; he is smashing his soul to please the masses. I suppose to the average person this Muzak-esque mix might not be all that bad. But to those of us who embraced Moby when he was new and understand Electronica it is a dark betrayal that really deserves nothing much less the multi-millions of dollars that he has earned through copywriting and album sales. It is in all honesty one of the most successful albums of all time. But does that make it a good CD? No. That makes it Pop. On a brighter note the song 'Natural Blues' is extremely well done. And 'Why does my hear feel so bad?' can be also passed as music. But you can get a Katcha remix of 'Natural Blues' on the Gatecrasher Global Sound System CD that is much faster and club worthy. ATB also has a remix of 'Why does my heart...' on the Ibiza '99 CD that is better than the original. Both remixes have more life more beat and more energy than this entire CD. So why bother picking this one up? If you are looking for good Electronica go somewhere else. If you are looking for pop you've come to the right place.

" This CD is very repetitive. The song structures are simple and there is no development. I don't consider this techno it's Pop music (not that that's WRONG but... if you're looking for TECHNO look elsewhere - like Fluke Underworld Squarepusher Plaid Autechre etc.) Porcelain is a good wholesome electronic song; I like it (who wouldn't?) The rest sound gimmicky - It's all very listenable but it doesn't take your mind or emotions anyplace. You just sit listen ok ... it's fine for the dentist's office. I'll still listen to my copy (which was a very thoughtful gift after I showed interest in exploring it due to the ratings). Some songs are good -- porcelain and ... I believe it is track 9 machete... whichever one sounds techno-like... these are good songs. The rest is just very so-so. Some old blues line - and I mean ONE LINE repeated incessantly over the same simple beat ... that is a good majority of this CD. Really this disc should probably get a little more than two stars because it is more enjoyable than another cd I recently gave a 2-star rating to.

" Once againMcDermott's verbal mastery takes you to the place of which she writes as clearly as if looking through a window on the scenes she describes so vividly. However compared to 'Charming Billy' this piece is disappointing. While very well written descriptively I found it slow. The opening act caught my attention and I continued to read hoping for more of the same alure...it was not to be found.

Women spy on the house of another woman they don't much care for. And perhaps most shocking of all Mrs. Carpenter sits in a chair that she purchased with no intention of sitting in. It sounds like suburbia to me. But in Alice McDermott's That Night these actions are highly transgressive acts that violate the limits of the characters' previously circumscribed roles in the neighborhood. For men that means not leaving your yard and barely saying hello to anyone. For women the role is that of the stay-at-home gossip fantasizing about widowhood and asking about Sheryl's mother Ann",2.0
" Come on people get over yourselves. You could find a hundred lovely writers out there and while McDermott may be one of them it doesn't mean there's anything particularly interesting about this book. It's filled with such melancholy and self-importance about subject matter that is really cliche at this point. Lovers torn apart young children in the neighborhood wondering how babies are made teen pregnancy. It's like something a junior high class might read.McDermott might be trying to pull off something magestic here but it just comes off as weird. Why is this first person narrator who isn't even a main character in the story wandering through these people's lives like a ghost and killing them all off? That's right when McDermott runs into a situation that's rather dull which is often she gives us a little aside about someone's child dying. It's manipulative and cheap writing. ",2.0
" I was eager to read the book after watching the film on BBC2 (England). I expected the novel to be more descriptive imaginative and more three dimensional than the film but found it to be quite sketchy and without fluidity. It jumped from past to present and from scene to scene quite disjointedly and I found it difficult to continue reading for I felt like I'd read the same paragraph over and over. As a result of this the only characters which seemed to convey themselves as three dimensional were that of Rick and Sheryls'. There didn't seem to be any revelation at the end of the story I guess with having knowledge of that era that it would be quite obvious in the way things ended with broken teenage love and little thought for the result of that. Quite disappointing overall though worth watching the film. ",2.0

" The only reason I came across this film was that I was mesmerized by the director's more recent work the Perfume. So I thought I'd check out the rest of his films.Lola gets a call from her boyfriend that he's lost his crime boss' money. And the boss is coming to collect it in 20 minutes. So Lola starts running originally to see her dad who is a banker. And then depending on how fast she can go or whether she gets held up or not entire lives can work out differently not only for herself but also for people that she bumps into - literally. The movie shows us 3 possible scenarios.The action's obviously quite fast because she's running just about the whole movie so you are made to feel that things are happening. But it's all extremely shallow the thrills and developments are very uninteresting.We are shown fates of people we do not care about at all. This is one of the main flaws of this film. It assumes that the audience will care about strangers. The only guy I cared about in the movie was the homeless fellow I looove that beard. Even Lola and her boyfriend didn't really move me though they looked like a lovely couple.The message of the film is also very much irrelevant. That the little choices we make or even just pure chance can have big effects on our lives and others'. No kidding! Give this guy a Nobel Prize! But I have a question",2.0

" This film is based on a single central idea which isn't particularly original in the first place. It tells a story from the point of view of several possible outcomes which provides an interesting way of telling a story though it is very reiterative.The film takes place in a typical mittel-Europa city - probably German - and concerns itself with a very slight plot in which there are multiple outcomes. I won't bore you with the detail but suffice to say that unless you like to look at the eponymous Lola (believe me she's no oil painting) running around the streets to get to talk to various people (hasn't she heard of the 'telephone' or the 'taxi'; perhaps the title of the film wouldn't work well 'Phone Lola Phone' and 'Ride Lola Ride' don't really have the same ring to them I suppose) you'll get pretty bored with this one - especially as it's telling the same story with a different ending three or four times.As entertainment this is only slighly more interesting than watching paint dry. I'll give it one more star than the absolute minimum due to it's interesting effort to try and tell a story in an innovative manner but beyond that there is very little of value here.Give this one a miss despite what the other fawning 5* reviews here are telling you.

" Although 'Run Lola Run' is off-beat has some nice camera work and a few impressive images I could not develop any interest in any of the characters. Lola's extreme red hair and goofy outfit (blue tank top white bra straps turquoise pants and black Doc Martin boots of all things) were distracting. The 'driving music beat' (or however it was described) was fairly boring and repetitive.The commentary was only slightly more interesting than the movie. The two participants of writer/director Tom and lead actress Franka were a couple at the time which accounts for the mutual admiration society feel of the commentary.There may have been a good idea for a movie here but I could not find it. Close to being the least watchable movie ('Lost and Delirious' 'The Smokers' 'Black and White' and 'Armageddon'). I nearly dozed off both times.I give the movie two stars for effort and concept but I advise you to...'Run Away Run' ",2.0

" My 16 year old daughter told me this film changed her life. I'm getting her into therapy soon. I suppose that as a study in film making techniques and creativity this film breaks some novel ground.

Look for something else! ",2.0
" I dont see what the BFD was about this movie. I mean yeah she looks cool and they do drugs yay. I thought the experimental 'and then' parts were kinda cool. But I just didnt like the movie. I dont think they connected the groundhog day feeling of it all together that well. Or obviously. This was better than the otherGroundhog Dayin how it was maybe an hour shorter. Not for me. And I usually like off beat movies. Just dont be off beat for the sake of being offbeat. I think I might check out the soundtrack though. ",2.0
" Wake me up when it's over! The only reason this movie gets two stars is for it's look and the excellent way the movie was shot. After that it's just boring repetitive dribble. I like the Hollywood movies better. 'Groundhog's Day' is 15 times better than this unimaginative lump of crap. ",2.0

" If you like thumping loud monotonous music you may like this film better than I did. With all the hungry talented musicians in the world I would think this film maker could have found one that could provide decent music.Although I liked Potente in other films it was difficult for me to find the characters interesting. Maybe I could forgive Lola for being in love but her boyfriend seemed worthless.Yes this film showed various futures that could have arisen from a single starting point. That is a good idea for a film but I just think in spite of the attempts at originality the result did not bear fruit. For a more intelligent film about the possibilities arising from a situation I think Rashomon would be a better way to spend your time. ",2.0

" The meat of the movie is given away by the title. Be prepared to watch Lola do an awful lot of running...and then some more. American movie critics seem to have a fetish for any movie foreign. Don't believe the hype...the plot is not ingenious nor are the direction and production groundbreaking. The basic idea (Lola has to come up with 100000 bucks and get it to her distressed boyfriend Manni in 20 minutes or he will be killed) would have made for an exciting short film but instead is stretched into an agonizing almost feature length film. The same story plays out three times with three different endings. The premise is interesting (not original)",2.0

" This film may have had a tad of art to it but for the most part it looked like a practice RUN for 'Groundhog Day.' I appreciate the differences but there is nothing unique about this movie. The only pleasure is comparing this to the hundreds of other similar movies ('Deja Vu' 'Sticky Fingers of Time' 'Happy Accidents' etc.)The story is very basic; boyfriend loses mob money to bum on subway. Girlfriend (Franka Potente quite hansom if you discount the red hair) frantic to help must RUN to his rescuer obtaining 100000 Deutschmarks (pre-Euro 2002) on the way. We are treated to several versions and there could have been more.-----------------------------------------------This film lends its self well to Blu-ray. And there are a few DVD extras worth watching. Unfortunately they spoke to fast to interpret so I needed the English subtitles.

" Picture the love child of Forrest Gump + 'Who Moved My Cheese' + that recent Jim Carrey movie 'Yes' - about a guy who decides to say yes to everything - and you pretty much get this book in a nutshell.Wanted to find value in this book because Homes has such a good rep. But either there's something I'm not getting or the emporer really is naked. This was way too gentle to be satire (even the wacky LA health camp is treated respectfully) way too silly to be taken seriously (hard to get more over-the-top than feral chihuahuas) way too psychologically preposterous to be psychologically credible (are we really supposed to believe stereotypes like 'the beatnick author' and 'the movie star'?) and way too simplistic to offer realistic advice - go ahead try saying 'yes' to everything and see if you get heroism and movie stars ... or creeps & trouble!I get the moral - that living means more than just existing - and don't dispute that it's a worthwhile message. But I'm going to stick with books like Dandelion Wine that preach the same message a lot more effectively and a whole lot more sincerely. ",2.0
" A decent book that could have been great Homes's novel came off underbaked. Too many implausible plot lines that are hastily tossed in incomplete cookie-cutter characters and a seeming desire on the part of the author to recreate the Los Angeles of 'L.A. Story' sabotage an otherwise compelling story of a man who is trying to find his life again.Were this story focused on its characters more and their actual issues instead of attempting to impress readers with the flash and bang of its irrelevant events this would have been a much more interesting book. Even the book's title suggests that Homes did not have a clear grasp on the point of this novel and she spends 384 pages wandering around the desert trying to find it. ",2.0
" One more example of ther importance of connections to success. While there are some amusing things in this book if you or I wrote it it would never be published. ",2.0
" I'm not sure how to go about reviewing this book considering the fact that what Homes intends to do is incredibly ambitious - trying to satirize the life of a middle-aged wealthy financier undergoing a physical and spiritual crisis - yet the finished product can be described as luke warm at best. Many writers have done an admirable job delving into the mindset of this particular subset of individuals but few have done it in a modern setting (the closest I can think of is Delillo in 'Cosmopolis' an equally luke warm novel). The novel follows the life of Richard Novak a wealthy trader who 'plays' with money while being isolated from the world and the events directly after a pain and/or panic attack he has in his large L.A. home. He comes out of the hospital realizing how alone he is and goes ahead and tries to reforge relationships with his estranged son and make new ones with an unlikely cast of characters - a wife who feels trapped in her marriage and goes to the supermarket to get away from it all a do-it-all actor a J.D. Salinger type writer who happens to be friends with Bob Dylan a coffee shop owner who is a source of wisdom to all who come to him...the list goes on. Many of the episodes are funny and entertaining yet at no point do you ever see through this thin and somewhat weak attempt at looking at the pain isolation brings on those around you and inevitably to yourself. In many respects the novel reminds me of some of Bret Easton Ellis's early work - especially the Informers - because of the money and the drug/Hollywood lifestyle Homes writes about. There is something extravagant in the way the characters live yet in many instances they don't notice at all. This may be the only fully successful part of the novel in that you can describe all of the characters as tragic in some way. Unfortunately although they have interesting attributes and designations they're all kind of cookie-cutter in their own way. You almost get bored reading about them and go ahead and wait for a resolution that is so unsatisfying that it overshadows the strength of Homes's prose one thing that is a carryover from her short fiction (where incidentally I think she should remain). All in all this is the kind of book that makes you sad because you may very well have wasted a few days that could have been spent on something better. ",2.0
" Ultimately this book is frustrating. It drones on like our own mundane lives except the characters in the book are unbelievable. Everyone is an exaggeration. Too rich too full of themselves too over the top too self serving.The conversations are all meaningless except maybe the one where Richard's son tells him how he feels about their relationship.Even the ending of the book is unresolved and open ended.If you like reading for the sake of reading I recommend it. If you're looking for inspiration to change your life do what the hero did... walk out your door and open your eyes... ",2.0

First of all these kids would have died in a few weeks at the most! There is NO way normal men could kill wild boars let alone young kids. Weapons are hard to make too I don't know how the older young boys around the age of 13 can make weapons that is sufficient and adequate enough to use for killing wild boars and other fierce creatures. This book is extremely far-fetched as I see it. But there are interesting elements too I suppose. It's very symbolical. There's some symbols that I didn't fully interpret until I look into them closer and I thought that was quite intriguing. It brings a more dark atmopshere into this book. One star for symbolism and another one is to be respective for the effort of this book being made. ",2.0

" I didn't paticularly enjoy Lord of the Flies but I must admit it was fairly interesting... Lord of the Flies is a novel about a bunch of young boys deserted on an island with no adults or the presence of society and all the complications that go with that. The whole book is a fight between right and wrong order and chaos and intellect and instinct-- Golding was trying to show just how much evil people have hidden inside covered by society or in other words that the only reason we ALL aren't savages is because society is always telling us we shouldn't be... A very interesting thought one that I do in a way stand behind but the actual PLOT and STORY of Lord of the Flies disappointed me so I don't believe you should take the time to read the entire book; just maybe the afterword written by Golding.

Although some people have it in them more than others. I think the author used a lot of description which made it really boring. He also used too much violence which in my opinion only made it worse. I think this can happen to anyone who is in a plane crash. Being in this situatuion can get your mind crazy and make you do weird things like the boys did. If it was me who wrote the book I would use less description becuase is made it boring. I would also make it less vioent. ",2.0
" The Lord of the Flies by William Golding takes place on an island with no adult supervision. Stuck on this island is a group of boys; most of them turn to hunting and killing (This group is led by Jack Merridew) and the two others (named Piggy and Ralph) stick to rules and trying to be rescued.

" I don't think that this book is as good as it is made out to be. I think that the idea or theme of the book was well thought out but I don't really think that is was well written. Golding had a good theme to his book about how we still have wild instincts that are just covered up by civilization until we feel the struggle to survive or the threat to our own life. Golding book was in my thought not well written. It was overly descriptive at some points to the point where it lost your interest.

" This book can be summed up in one word",2.0
" Look I get it. I understand that William Golding's LORD OF THE FLIES is an allegorical examination of the inherent depravity of the human condition. I get Golding's depressing message that man is a nihilistic savage when left to his own devices. I understand that Ralph represents civilization order and decency (the alleged 'grown-up world'); Piggy represents common sense and the rule of law; and Jack aggression chaos. . .evil. I totally get the symbolism of a group of boys (innocence) on a remote island sans adult supervision completely devolving into anarchy.Yet I had several problems with this 20th Century 'classic.' The characters were one-dimensional paper cutouts; the dialogue confusing and hard to follow; the description of the island's terrain downright confusing (creepers?).

" (Marooned)- Lord Of The FliesI some what liked this book it was really for people who like blood and gore kind of stuff.What I didn't like about this book was that it carried on conversaions that really didn't even make any sence at all to this book.If anyone was to read this book Lord Of The Flies I would basically suggest this book only to people who love to picture blood every where. I would describe the plot basically as all about blood nothing much too it just a couple of boys marooned on an island and nothing to do but kill other things well i won't tell the whole story cause that would just give the book away. Lord Of The Flies is not based on an true story obviously. If there was any other books to come out like Lord Of The Flies I probabaly wouldn't read it just considering it wasn't my type of book to read. I read more of comedy and ect.When your reading thiis book you can basically look at it as a movie it runs through your head and you can have a clear picture about all of the details and blood.Consider reading the back cover of the book and notice that the author William Sir Golding is writng this book based on the 20th century european fiction.

" I just finished reading Lord of the Flies in my gr. 11 English class and I wish that this book was not required to be read in school because I do not recommend it. Although it was thought provoking and at times you really felt for the characters it was too grim a look at mankind. I entirely disagree with Golding's idea of mankind being inherently evil and that made it hard to get into the book and also made it hard to believe. This was fairly well written but I have read books that challenged my intelligence more. It is obvious that Golding wrote this book as a way of getting his point across to people and you can see this because the reading comprehension is pretty simple and most people can breeze through it. I felt that it was borderline propaganda and I actually regret that i have read it but I didn't have much choice in the matter. ",2.0

" In my opinion Lord of the flies was on of the dullest books I have ever read. It started off slow and at times I found myself trying hard not to fall asleep. The plot was actually quite interesting but William Golding wrote it in such a way sometimes I couldn't understand exactly what was going on. His word choice left me scanning through a dictionary a majority of the book. Yet this book did contain some quite profound symbolism. The theme would have to be the best party of this novel being it relates to the real world or the cruelties of the real world.Some of the scenes in this book are actually quite violent and unrealistic being that the kids are so young. In fact numerous times I became sick to my stomach. Some of the scenes were good and beautifully written but overall I felt most of it was superfluous . ",2.0
" First of all I will admit to a profound distaste for heavy-handed symbolism and since this book is nothing but--well profound distaste on my part was inevitable. Personally by the time I've finished analyzing how Piggy's glasses symbolize human reason the pig's head represents human evil etc. the book has lost its impact for me and becomes pretentious.But that is not my main problem with this book. I find it frightening that so many people consider this book 'revealing' and a 'classic'. This seems to indicate that the message of this book has universal relevance for people. And this message is as follows",2.0
" I somehow graduated from high school -- a boys religious high school no less -- without being assigned Lord of the Flies. So I decided to read the mother of all high school English books.I came to the text with certain preconceptions and prejudices. Like many high school students I was force-fed my share of meaningful stories with something to say. I though To Kill a Mockingbird was simple and didactic and after two readings I cannot comprehend what any serious person sees in The Catcher in the Rye. In Cold Blood and The Stranger were more my speed stories with the confidence to tell their tales and not hit you over the head with life lessons. I approached Lord of the Flies with wariness.The story is well known. A flight filled with English schoolboys crashes on an uninhabited island killing all of the adults. Ralph a charismatic but forgetful 12-year-old is elected the leader of the survivors who quickly segregate by function. Ralph determines the day's tasks. Fat but smart Piggy counsels. Jack and the members of his boys' choir hunt the island's wild pigs. The 'littluns' the six- and seven-year-olds exist in a task-less state of near hysteria.Jack the warrior prince who provides meat becomes envious of Ralph's position as leader. The principal arc of the 200-page book is the heightening tension between Ralph whose priority is to maintain a signal fire and be rescued and Jack whose priority is to hunt and lead.Many passages were suprisingly clunky. Dialogue sections repeatedly ignored Strunk and White's admonition to 'make sure the reader knows who is speaking.' Author William Golding devoted substantial space to physical descriptions but they tended to be vague and confusing. Many of the secondary characters were cardboard as thinly drawn as in Dickens but without the cartoonish charm. The narration's point of view changed abruptly at certain points.Lord of the Flies was Golding's first novel so imperfections can be forgiven. He was ultimately awarded the Nobel Prize and a Booker so to paraphrase Shelly Winters some people thought he could write.But what is it about this book an almost archetypal 'promising' first novel that has landed it on so many required reading lists? Lord of the Flies has sold more than 10 million copies deep into Dan Brown territory and my raggedy paperback is the 96th Capricorn printing. (Interestingly the book initially flopped selling only a few thousand copies.)Much of the success of Lord of the Flies must be due to the fact that it is a useful tool when teaching some of the basics of literary theory.First of all kids will read it especially boys who may not be the most avid readers. The idea of a world without grown-ups catches adolescent interest. The book is short. There's a fair amount of action including a taut climax.Moreover the Big Themes are laid on with a backhoe. The symbolism is so obvious that the slowest kid in fourth-track English can figure it out. A student can spend hours matching the characters with their analogues in modern society and judging from some of the web pages devoted to the book students have spent much more time than that. Every high school English teacher needs to explain that sometimes there's more to a story than what the characters do and say and Lord of the Flies feels custom-cooked for that effort.I don't think Lord of the Flies has much to offer an adult reader but it's a pleasant reminder of youthful efforts to learn the rudiments of symbolism and subtext.Now class what do Piggy's glasses represent?

" I think that the authors purpose for writing this was to send a message that there is evil in all men. I agree with him because the boys expressed it after they lost respect for eachother. They all showed some kind of evil on the island. The literary element that the author showed was symbolism. He handled it very well because it made you want to keep reading to see if his symbolism was true or not. In my opinion this book was believable because imagine being on the for six to nine months. the boys went crazy thinking about how long they were going to survive which of course made the evil come out in them.

" i think the author's message of this book is very clear. He is telling about how mean cruel and uncaring people can be no matter what age. I definately agree with this because of all the horrible things that are seen on the news it's supports my theory. I think the author used characters best in the book because in the book from beginning to end he analzyes and builds up every character. This is good because it lets you know who you're reading about. This book was pretty much believable excpet for the fact that the kids were a little too young to be doing what they were doing. Which incidentely in my opinion is the only flaw in this book. If i were the author i would have simply changed the kids ages by making them a couple of years older. If this was done it would have been much better and more realistic. I would recommend this book to anyone. ",2.0
" In the novel Lord of the Flies there is a direct correlation to the way the boys attempt to set up a form of organized government and todays world. Ralph and Jack the main characters both seek to accomplish complete power of the island. Although they have a different opinion on how to run the island each boy wants to be the leader and in complete domination.Ralph is set up to portray the 'good guy' or the protagonist of the story. He is voted the first to be in charge of everyone on the island and through the beginning of the novel tries to run the island through a democracy. But as the book continues he begins to lose control and a more anamalistic behavior takes over. At the same time Jack is competing against Ralph to turn all of the little children against Ralph to feed his hunger for power.Jack is the obvious symbol of evil and wrong doing in the novel. As the book continues Jack begins to feed more and more off of the power he recieves. Jack tries to turn the island into an anarchy. Ultimately Jack gains all of the power out of pure fear from the little ones. The chronological order of the book also covers the necessary toics needed to show the rise and decline of the different leaders. ",2.0
" This book I found took a while to get into but had a good way of starting. I love the plot and how everything turns out at the end. The story starts of well but soon enough the children become scared because of the 'beast'.The group is split into two. Ralph and Piggy end up by themselves and Jack and his tribe become a bit obbsessed with the beast. They are the hunters and almost become to caught up in being standed on the island and fending for themselves.They go to far and end up doing things that are quite shocking for anyone espeshally children. The group become to over the top and they end up just not caring about their old friends anymore.One of the main points in the book is the fire. They decide to make a fire and keep it going so that passing planes nad ships would be able to find them. When the fire is left to go out and a plane passes the island Ralph and Jack have the fight that almost leads to jacks death.The tribe and jack and piggy are always stealing and fighting and even when people get hurt and things are getting out of control. Alot of the book is very sad and it just shows you what could happen if people did get stranded on the island. Toward the end things are going crazy and before they find adults theey almost burn down the island trying to find Ralph.When the children suddenly become in contact with adults at the end again they act as if they have woken up from a very long dream. They start crying and everything hits them that has happened in the last few weeks. They tried to act like adults and make rules but things definatly didint go as smooth as im sure all of them wanted. ",2.0
" After The Lord of the Flies I had lots of mixed feelings. This book had its good and bad points. There were a few times when i got really into the book but a lot of points where i found myself dozing off or just not paying attention to a single word i read on the page.I really liked the begging of the book. It seemed like this could have possibly happen. The kids on the island formed a small society and create a form of government and a system like I believe anyone stranded on the island would be.As the book progressed i became more and more less interested in the book. The author wrote a lot of the same ideas over and over like jacks going on and on about hunting. GET THE IDEA CAN WE GET ON WITH THE REST OF THE STORY!After a while i lost the sense of the characters actions being realistic. Jack forms a tribe that splits off of the rest of the kids. His tribe seems to be based on hunting and spilling blood. They start singing 'KILL THE BEAST! CUT HIS THROAT! SPILL HIS BLOOD!' Which is the most random thing i can ever imagine anyone doing.Golding in my mind never actually explains how the kids survive. The kids just live you don't really hear about how they find the fruit or the water. None of the kids ever complains (except about mean over and over...) about things like sunburns or lack of food being cold things you would expect from a bunch of young kids trapped on a tropical island in the middle of nowhere.Even though Golding does not address the main points in my mind the points he does address he does very well. Ralph has a strong will to get rescued and him and piggy seem to be the only ones that are actually trying to get rescued. But Golding creates this beast that started out as just a nightmare into the kids killing each other because they are so paranoid. I wonder how the kids ever became so violent and bloodthirsty.All in all i didn't like the book. But for people who like a very fantastic and random story in no way could be true; you might like it. If you are looking to read a serious book about survival in the wild i suggest hatchet which is very good in describing the way a boy learns to live (emphasis on the learns). He does not just run around and kill things like the kids in LOTF. ",2.0
" William Golding wrote a good book contrasting two types of war. Boys are stranded on an island after a plane crash. They are challenged to face a number of opsticals including death. The time set is during WWII. ",2.0
" Yet another book suffering from the 'classic-itis' syndrome. Golding presents an intriguing premise and utilises provoking themes of savagery versus civilization but he writes in such an uninspired and drawn-out manner that it's extremely difficult to truly absorb oneself into the narrative. Every character was flat and unlikeable in at least one way; the only one that came close to gaining my interest was one I pitied and I deeply dislike piteous characters.I am female and I have usually never minded any lack of prominent female roles in books or films. The way Golding uses the female here though is half-baked and somewhat insulting. As well while I don't mind symbolism if it's varied and carefully used there is only really one large symbolic theme in this book and I found it rather elementary and fumbled.I don't mind gore either -- among my favourite books is All Quiet on the Western Front and despite its skewered view one of my favourites movies is the hyperrealistic Black Hawk Down -- but the gore here has almost no emotional value at all and simply disgusts.The closing paragraphs are the only parts that came close to being interesting if just for the symbolic contrast it provided. Even then however because Golding for me had built no tension or suspense whatsoever up to it it merely showed how silly the entire affair and its participants were and almost made me laugh despite the apparent gravity that was involved.It may have been all the enthusiasm around it from other readers but even so William Golding's 'Lord of the Flies' is one of the worst 'good' books I have ever read.

" The Lord of the Flies by William Golding wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. I thought that the idea of the book was very good and the theme was well thought out but i don't think it was well written. Some parts could have been better but it was interesting. Somethings I disliked were that there were only boys on the island and no girls. If there were girls I think the story would have been different. I also didn't like how Piggy died. I think the book would have had a better ending if Piggy stayed alive.Some things that i liked about the book were most of it was realistic. The schoolboys made rules for themselves and there became two sides. I liked how the characters were described and how the meanings of their names mathed their actual names. ",2.0
" I picked up this book when someone had mentioned they were required to read it in school as children. This book is about the end of innocence and the heart of darkness. Ok before you get scared away by the two phrases I just mentioned let me explain. So without even reading the book you probably know it's about a bunch of English schoolboys who get stranded on an island and are forced to survive without the supervision of adults. This book is supposed to be full of symbolisms; each character and animal represent some idea or entity in society. The end of innocence I mentioned begins with the slaughter of a pig for food. The heart of darkness comes when the leader of the hunting tribe loses his mental stability and decides to hunt for more than just pig.It's actually a very short story (208 pages) and the dialogue is very simplistic. I found the author's descriptions of the jungle beach lagoon and mountain to be quite boring. (You'll also notice that I said schoolboys in the last paragraph; there are no girls in this story. There is no underlying love story. There is no humor. There is no excitement whatsoever.)To be honest I don't like this book. Even less so as required reading for school kids. To not interpret the symbolisms would be to leave the book as a plotless story. Yet to interpret it would mean exposing children to the horrors of savagery abuse and survival.LEAP rating (each out of 5)",2.0

" I thought Lord of the Flies was okay but it wasn't the greatest book ever written. I felt there were quite a few changes the author could have made to the story. First of all I didn't like the way the book used so much symbolism. This along with many British terms I didn't understand made it very confusing. I also didn't like how the author killed off the littlun with the birthmark Simon and Piggy. I thought there was just something wrong about killing off three young children.There were some good aspects of the book. First of all I liked the way the author described the environment the boys were in. It was very thorough. I also thought it was good how the author divided the boys into two seperate societies. I felt it demonstrated the two sides of society very well. It demonstrated that on the surface society seems organized and well-governed. But sometimes underneath it all people can be savage cruel and sadistic to each other.Overall I felt that this book was okay. But I wouldn't recomend it to most people and probably wouldn't read it again. ",2.0
" If you ask ten people who have read William Golding's Lord of the Flies half of those people will say that they loved it or 'thought it wasn't that bad' and other five will say that they despised it. I am one of those who despised it. There are definitely some good maybe even great qualities of Lord of the Flies and the allegorical and symbolic meanings that are hidden throughout the book are important and a good thing to study in class yet if I was given this and say War and Peace I would grab War and Peace in a second. The truth to why I dislike LotF so very much is a bit complicated. This book opens on a boy wandering around an island. You are given almost no information on where this boy(or the other boys who show up later) came from. There are little bits of information of their back story stuck in the book almost randomly. Unless you are paying a lot of attention to every word that Golding writes it is easy to miss these precious details. That is not the only reason that this is not may favorite book in the world. I'm not sure if Golding purposely did this or if this is just the way he happened to write it but the the majority of the characters seem to be purely evil and it is quite hard to read the book without feeling you have personal grudge against each one. I won't go into intimate details (just so you can read it yourself and understand the disgust I have with these boys) but each boy acts in a certain way that makes you wonder how evil a child can be when not under any kind of adult supervision or guidance. In conclusion if you would like to buy this book I warn you. You may be one of the ones who like it and shrug off the savagery of the boy or you could be one who can't even stand to finish it. It is completely up to you. ",2.0

" The Lord Of The Flies is without a doubt a classic work of symbolism. William Golding really did do an incredible job of linking every vague detail in his book to the ideas he had about human nature and the post world war II world in symbolistic forms (The Conch The Glasses The Beast). Still finishing the book leaves one with a rather bitter taste in their mouth. I feel that the extraneous amounts of unnecessary violence Golding included and the extreme behavior of the characters as the story progressed really kept me from appreciating the true artistic essence and incredible emotion of this book.The story itself begins with a group of young military-school boys (who are assumed to have suffered a plane crash over the ocean water) landing on a small uninhabited tropical island. Ralph the main character quickly steps up to leading the group and gets the boys on track to getting rescued. He has them start a signal fire; make shelters and just generally keeps them in a microcosmic society of the world they once knew.The society quickly breaks down though. Jack (a boy jealous of Ralph's leadership) is overcome by his urge to hunt wild pigs and have fun and finally leaves the group over a conflict of interest about the signal fire. Gradually everyone who once followed Ralph leave him to join Jack's primordial savage hunting tribe where they hunt wild pigs and savagely kill them. This in itself is graphically documented throughout the book and the boys' morals are gradually replaced with more primitive instinct and reasoning.Before you know it a book that started out fairly boringly is filled with rotting severed pig's heads on sticks talking to characters in the book (in their head showing their mental stability starting to depart from them but somewhat disturbing none the less) and Jack's tribe savagely killing some of the boys that didn't join them for unclear reasons (being overcome by their lust for violence rebellion from sane society call it what you will). There is a sporadic parallel story going on about a 'Beast' which is nothing more than the boys' respective manifestations of their worst fears (and perhaps the fear of the consequences of their actions catching up with them) and this fear feeds Jack's tribe's ruthlessness towards the end of the book. Quite predictably the book ends with the boys being rescued but not before Jack and his tribe almost murders Ralph.I really wish I could have appreciated this book more but frankly the writer's negative view of the world (which was in turn reflected in his writing) was a little too depressing to be enjoyable. I do recommend the book as a good read at least once and it is without a doubt a classic work of literature but when it all comes down to it... I feel it is both a boring and highly depressing story.

" OK I must be the odd man out here. This book falls into many of the 'listmania' lists of other books that I found to be quite good. So I had it delivered and found it to be the worst book I've read in a few years. What do people see in this?I'll grant the fact that there is some nice symbolism with the conch the boar head and such. But that is all it has going for it.Golding attempts to show the reader how easily mankind can become corrupted when left to their own devices but the story he masked it with is pretty poor. For something written as recent as 1950 I would have expected much better.First off there is no mention of what happened to the plane. Just some boys on an island and the plane crash just seemed to be a way to get them there. There is no wreckage to deal with no dead bodies smelling up the island. Secondly there is no time reference at all. It seems that the kids hair just grew long magically overnight. Without any mention to a timeframe it appears they are on the island about a week. I'm sure it was longer because nobody should have as little faith in humankind to think that we should devolve to savages so quickly. Maybe Golding did think it could happen that fast... I don't know.I wouldn't recommend this book to someone who really enjoys reading and likes to see the plot and the characters well developed. This seemed to be thrown together with no regard to the plot whatsoever. If this book comes on a recommended list but there are other options AVOID THIS ONE! ",2.0
" I have for some years had an axe to grind with whatever committee of human waste it was that got together and decided what constituted classic literature. It must have happened at some point that a group of people declared themselves worthy to judge for our youth what would teach them to love reading what made a good story.I love reading. I love a good story. I hate Lord of the Flies.As hard as the educational system tried to force me to read and appreciate their endless list of disturbing books I still love reading good ones. And when I think back on these school-supported pieces of filth Lord of the Flies stands out as the top representative of what is awful in a book.I get what the man was going for what he was trying to say about humanity. I wish I could say he was dead wrong about human nature but indeed I think he accomplished just what he set out to do. That got the novel one extra star. No more. Yes when left to their own devices a group of innocents could very well turn savage.And that's exactly what is wrong with making young people read it. Is there no other novel to teach them about human nature? They'll hate whatever we give them true and maybe that's why they have been given such vile specimens to save the good books for them to appreciate later. But it's no excuse...When I read this in school it was horrible enough in print but then they saw to it that we watched a dank dark desolate motion-picture rendition as well in order that we might forever have burned into our memories the image of a little boy being speared by bullies and a plump boy being crushed by a boulder shoved by those bullies.

" Lord of the Flies is a powerful story about a group of English schoolboys who have survived a plane crash and are stranded on a deserted island. In the beginning it seems like the boys will have quite an awesome adventure--they are completely on their own with no adult supervision. One of the oldest boys Ralph attempts to get the others organized so that they will have food shelter and a rescue signal fire.Ralph's logical approach to survival is soon challenged by Jack the novel's antagonist who is also in charge of the hunting. His desire for total power is quickly evident as he and his followers become increasingly wild barbaric and cruel. Their cruelty extends beyond simply hunting animals for food. Soon they are hunting and killing each other.While I did not particularly enjoy reading this book I believe that the way the different characters are developed is interesting. Each of the main characters seems to represent an aspect of human nature and society. For example Ralph represents the civilizing instinct in human beings compared to savagery represented by Jack. Simon who is shy and more sensitive than the others seems to represent the natural goodness found in people. Roger represents exactly the opposite--he is sadistic and very cruel. I think my favorite character is Piggy because he is a very logical thinker and smart. Because I found this character appealing his murder was very disturbing to me.Actually the entire story was disturbing. It was hard to imagine that the boys waging this 'war' against each other were so young--the oldest was only twelve years old. It was interesting to me that the more violent the story got the older the boys seemed. I think what I didn't like was the implication that humans are innately evil. Goodness was portrayed as an aspect of civilization. As civilization deteriorated throughout the story cruelty and violence increased. It seemed more natural to be evil than to be good. The severed pig's head (named the Lord of the Flies) mounted on the stake in the forest seemed to represent that innate evil. Since I don't believe that humans are naturally cruel and violent I found this book difficult to read. It is not a book I would recommend. ",2.0

" The Lord of the Flies is about an airplane which crashes on an island and a group of kids are trapped there. The book is about their time spent on the island. The main characters are Ralph Piggy Jack and Simon. As soon as they crash on the island they start having many problems. At first everyone is good and picks Ralph as chief. Then things slowly start to turn bad when Jack and his hunters let the fire out and a ship went by without seeing the smoke. Jack takes everyone but Piggy Ralph Simon and some little ones and goes to the other side of the island and makes his own tribe. My favorite character is Ralph because he seems to be the only smart one with some kind of authority on the island. He is the only adult like figure on the island.Ralph shows the kind of person that will see a problem and try to fix it the right way. Jack sees a problem as an opportunity to take control and start running everything and making the problem worse at the same time. I see this everyday even when I am in class. You have your kids that are like Jack and want to give the teacher and everyone else a hard time. Then you have people like Ralph. The person in class that sits there and does the work because they know that making things harder for the teacher will only make things harder for them. I'm like two in one because if I see a chance to make a good joke I make it. Otherwise I keep my mouth closed.I thought the book was kind of confusing because the author jumped around a lot. And didn't explain things as well as he should. The book went a little slow too. My favorite part in the book is at the end when the navy officer is standing there talking to Ralph. It's a flash back to real life. The only thing I would change in the book is the lack of information.This book is easy to get into in the beginning but then slows down during the end. I spent a lot of time rereading parts in the book. The only people I think would like this is a younger kid because they don't care about understanding it or an older person because they have the knowledge to understand what is happening. ",2.0

" I watched a pretty terrible movie called Beowulf last night. It stars Christopher Lambert which is a pretty good indication of the movie's level of badness. The movie is a futuristic retelling of the Beowulf story and it does a half-decent job of it until the end when it suddenly veers into an erotic horror tale. I really don't remember the Old English version having Grendel's mom as a hot blonde porn star. I also don't remember the epic being boring filled with clicheed second-scare bad cuts between scenes or Beowulf being such a wooden character.The movie had two good things going for it",2.0
" 'Beowulf' is the hero of an old epic poem of which name you might remember in the English literature class (Perhaps it will be better-known thanks to Gerard Butler who is to play the title role in the 2005 film.) Whatever his version may be my advice about this Christopher Lambert version is this",2.0
" To call this version of Beowulf mediocre wouldn't be appropriate to the level of blandness that it brings to the screen. There's relatively little to like in this post-apocalyptic recasting of the ancient poem itself a 10th Century Christianized retelling of an even older pagan myth.Christopher Lambert stars (which should tell you most of what you need to know already) and does almost as a good job of acting as he did in the Highlander movies which is to say not that well at all. To be fair he isn't given much to work with here and neither is the rest of the cast (more on them later.) He pretty much broods around the screen with a perpetual scowl on. He's also very little like the Beowulf of legend. This version of Beowulf is an abomination (I don't want to say too much for fear of giving away the story) and is thankfully a virtual martial arts master as well. Ironically for all of his talent he is unable to best Grendal nearly as easily as the original Beowulf who in one fight ripped the beast's arm off.The cast is mostly a joke. It's clear that the director felt that recasting the tale in the future would give him more possibilities. After all in the 10th century there were few women who liked to put their men to shame by kicking more butt then they could. And they also didn't care to dress with as little clothing as possible. As hard as it might be for our culture to realize there was a time when modesty was a virtue. Also very rare among the 10th century Danes were black men who's sole purpose was comic relief. But fear not this movie's got that angle covered. The king is well cast and is mostly sympathetic. But he ends up being part of the largest disaster to come along in this long sad line of disasters.Because see what would Beowulf be without lots of sex? Oh wait the original didn't have sex you say? Eh it should have. And this movie makes sure that you know that it's all about sex. Thankfully we're spared most of the details but by the end (and again I can't say too much without ruining the end) it's perfectly clear that no tale can stand up against our sex obsessed culture. Add to this a ridiculous interpretation of Grendal's mother and you're thankfully almost to the end of this garbage. As a note to those who are familiar with the poem the movie does not cover the final third of Beowulf's story and barely manages to include a horribly mangled version of the middle third. Hollywood still seems obsessed with a 'happy' ending and so that is what we get albiet a shallow and absurd happy ending considering the rest of the movie.If techno music overly-choreographed fights re-using the same moves several times shallow characters mediocre effects and flat acting are your idea of a good time...then go and pick this movie up. Otherwise unless you're a hardcore science fiction fan you'll want to stay away from it. For those of us addicted to sci-fi it's probably worth seeing once just to say you have seen it. But after that there isn't much there. ",2.0
" The epic poem that is Beowulf ranks as one of the greatest pieces of literature man has ever produced. When a reader ponders the ideas found within this wonderful work of art the mind simply boggles at the depth and richness running throughout the poem. Glimpses of the old Europe abound in this tale about Hrothgar Beowulf Grendel and Grendel's mother a Europe of drinking halls campaigns of conquest human destiny and dark monsters creeping through the night. Simultaneously a reader of Beowulf glimpses the stirrings of Christianity which would soon overrun all of Europe and put an end to the old ways. Scholars of Beowulf never tire of writing articles and books about this piece of literature and new translations of the work continually appear. If you wish to read Beowulf and I recommend you do so as quickly as possible check out the spectacular Seamus Heaney translation. Do not under any circumstances watch this cinematic version of Beowulf in lieu of reading the poem. Not only does this movie not follow the epic in any significant way the film also takes a decidedly B movie approach to the whole topic. 'Beowulf' stars Z movie star Christopher Lambert as the enigmatic hero another point you would do well to consider before popping this disc in your DVD player.At some point in the future in a time never elaborated upon by the filmmakers a fortress stands watch on the borderland between good and evil. The soldiers in the fort led by a king named Hrothgar and his right hand man Roland fight endlessly with a mysterious creature who shambles out of the dark each night to claim a new victim. The garrison rapidly diminishes under the onslaught of this malevolent apparition until one day a man rides up to the fort claiming that his destiny involves fighting evil. This man is Beowulf played with mind deadening woodenness by a bleach blonde Christopher Lambert. The men manning the fort are naturally suspicious of this new arrival but after Beowulf fights the creature to a standstill the men are more accepting of his presence. In no time at all Beowulf antagonizes Roland wins the admiration of Hrothgar and catches the eye of the king's busty daughter Kyra. The killings continue unabated until the big showdown between Beowulf and Grendel the name of the being haunting the soldiers in the castle. A further surprise appears in scenes involving Hrothgar's dream encounters with a mysterious blonde apparition a woman who has something to do with the death of the king's wife and who eventually plays a big role at the end of the film.Initially I warmed to 'Beowulf.' Despite Lambert in the lead role most of the actors did a better than expected job in their roles. The gorgeous Rhona Mitra did an adequate turn playing Hrothgar's daughter. Charles Robinson who played Mac on 'Night Court' does as much as he can in the role of the fort's chief weapons master and the actors playing Hrothgar and Roland did acceptable work as well. The set pieces looked better than average for a B movie as did the armor and weapons used by the characters. The movie starts with a nice fight scene between Beowulf and a small army outside of the fort and this too gave me hope that the movie would rise above my original expectations. As the movie wore on I discovered my interest waned considerably. The CGI effects used for Grendel and his mother looked cheesy and uninteresting and Lambert's portrayal of Beowulf tended to grate after the first thirty minutes. The soundtrack contributed greatly to my sense of irritation. The filmmakers saw fit to imbue this project with a booming techno beat and used it every chance they got whether the scene called for it or not. Sometimes this music does work but far too often it distracts and annoys. To keep boredom at bay I began to count how many times Beowulf executed fancy back flips during the combat sequences. In fact it seemed that the only thing Lambert's character did after awhile was jump around strike poses and mutter cryptic phrases about the evil in the fort. As the final credits rolled I knew I had just finished watching a typical B movie stinker.The 'Beowulf' DVD is far from a bare bones sort of release. There is a trailer for the film along with additional trailers for films like 'Scream 3.' A short behind the scenes featurette is also available. The movie itself looks good for a low budget bomb and you should still have a good time watching the nice looking women in this movie even if you cannot stomach the lousy dialogue or abominable special effects. 'Beowulf' is a must see for those who get a kick out of science fiction cheese films or fans of Christopher Lambert but all others should stay away. ",2.0
" I liked the 13th Warrior at least they tried to recreate the world that actually existed but in reality it was based on a novel by Michael Crichton called Eaters of the Dead not Beowulf. Making a film version of Beowulf in the time it existed would be possible but with no help from the poem. It's images of lands and places are sparse. The original poet liked to describe the insides of rooms gold gifts weapons battles and skirmishes but the setting is very sparse the filmmaker must supply his own image of the setting. I agree however that this was not the setting the film needed it suffered as a result. F/X can't make up for poor writing nothing can which is exactly why you shouldn't see this film.

" I'm sitting here reading these reviews and wondering if anyone even read the description on the back of the box about this movie. Over and over people are commenting on the technology that is present in the movie. Well if certain people had takent the time to read the synopsis on the back cover one would find that this moves takes place in a futuristic setting. There are some remanants of technology left but most of it has been left behind in a 'muted past'.I didn't find this movie to be a masterpiece but it was enjoyable for at least a night's rental. Christopher Lambert is just wooden throughout and does his best job at being Mad Max but just does not pull it off. The character Kyra is tough and really is the only believable person in the movie. What I did like about the movie was the setting the costumes the weapons and overall bleak post apocolyptic vision of the future. ",2.0
" Here is a film about one great story of the European cultural heritage and with an actor (Christopher Lambert) that excels in that kind (he was great in the movies Highlander.) I had high expectations and as the movie is very disappointing I can not give it more than 2 stars. The dialogues are poor there is no depth anywhere in the film the music is awfully terrible and ugly (pop / techno...) the ugly fighters (their look etc.) do not belong to the dark ages or the Medieval times but to Mad Max the castle (seen on the skyline) looks like a crazy top-down castle (should I say postmodern or a la Picasso?) the mother of the monster really acts like a porn-star (I really thought I was watching a porn-movie during the sex sequences) etc. all cheap stuff poorly combined together.And the mythic religious metaphysical dimension of the tale is not explored not given any depth in the film. Think by contrast of the richness with which John Boorman expresses the pagan worldview in Excalibur (e. g. when Arthur sees insects moving on the earth while Merlin sleeps etc. to illustrate the pagan view that the Earth has a soul) (and Excalibur had gorgious music Wagner and Orff's Carmina Burana etc.) By contrast to Excalibur the materialist version of the Arthurian legend (the one featuring Sean Connery I even forgot the name of the movie) is very poor no match.

Beowulf can do multiple black flips and spin in the air and yet the monsters can still hit him!

" This movie promises a lot - a story arround a classic legend one of the best actors up to date and a nice fantasy flair. What you get is different. The fact that the creators of the Mortal Kombat Movie did this picture says already a lot. What you get is a superficial techno fantasy movie with a silly story boring acting trashy tekkno music cheap special effects and Christopher Lambert yet in one of his worst roles cause the plot doesn't give him any chance to show up his great acting abilities or even just his charme (in beowulf everything he says sounds boring and that's not his fault it's cause the dialogues are very flat). All that makes you feel like watching a mix of that hercules tv series and the mortal kombat movies. There is no point in wasting money on that one. Those who like simple entertainment should better watch Hercules or Xena on TV for free and Lambert adorers can save their money here and buy the great new 'Ressurection' where you get that great acting again that made him so famous.

I think Christopher Lambart is a first class actor the story is wonderful and so is the sets and music.

" I'm a big fan of Cibo Matto's 'Viva La Woman!' and was really looking forward to this new cd.. But here it is almost a year later and I still can't listen to it clear through. Fans of their earlier work should stay away or at least be ready to be disappointed. Songs like 'Working For Vacation' and 'King Of Silence' are very catchy and worth the price of the cd. The focus no longer seems to be on beautiful bizarre and haunting vocals but on the electric and synthesizer heavy background trash. I hope their next one is better. ",2.0
" A HUGE fan of Viva La Woman I found this album incredibly disappointing. Although technically and musically masterful it lacks any of the heart ingenuity experimentation or verve of the first album. It's an album of style with no substance.For example while the songs on the first album morph--changing instrumentations and beats--the songs on Stereotype are predictable and formulaic. They borrowed heavily from other genres--jazz funk pop--without introducing anything new. And the hard edge is totally gone--except for on Sci-Fi Wasabi and Blue Train--and these two songs are formula rap and rock. The whole album could have been done by just about anybody; it lacks any character that could be called Cibo Matto.If you liked the track 'Sugar Water' (the only song I ever skipped over) on the first album and you want to sit through entire album of it by all means buy this album.I blame Sean Lennon's blah 'I'm so technical it hurts' influence for trashing this once exciting band. They were just as boring live this year as on album--they even sugared the old material. ",2.0

" It seems the general opinion on this page seems to place 'The Hardest Way...' at their second best spot as far as The Streets albums go. I am going to have to disagree with this opinion. I originally was brought into the world of the streets with 'Original Pirate Material' and loved the simple beats good flow and the mixture of funny songs serious songs and sad songs all together on one album.I will admit when I first bought 'A Grand Don't Come for Free' I was a little turned off by the slightly different styling. It had appeared that Skinner had decided just to talk semi-animatedly over the garage beats. But that album really is a classic once you listen to it and let the words and beats get into you. This album to me turned from one I was sorry I bought in the first 2 days to my favorite of all of the albums.It is with regret that I must say this new album disapointed me completely. I have had it for a week and though the songs can be catchy and interesting I feel it has lost the flair of the past albums. I saw a review that said it was glad to see this album after the second one which had strayed into another mainstream sound. I could not disagree more. I feel that this album is the one to stray into the mainstream. The beats are not as original or catchy the songs not as funny or captivating. Besides his use of notoriously bad rhyming which really helps the unique sound to most people and has stayed constant through all the records it does not seem like the same old Mike to me.I still like the cd. I'm not saying it is a complete waste of money but I feel it is more for those who like the average typical rap sound. As someone who doesn't so much I still enjoy the album because I love The Streets dearly. Give it a try yourself though. It seems I am the only person to rank this at the bottom of the list for the three albums but I think most of the longtime fans will find that this record has strayed from the raw roots and unique style into a more mainstream sound.

" Considering it was semi-suprising that Skinner didn't end up with a sophomore slump (Grand was interesting and although a step down far from dissapointing) it's not at all shocking that his third album hits a wall in a bad way. For the most part there's absolutely nothing her that was present on his first 2 discs. He's semi removed himself from the garage claims he came up on in that his production is sharper and his beats are cleaner. But that unfortunately doesn't make the album good or even descent. It has none of the emotion feeling or believability that his first two discs had. The first single 'when you wasn't famous' is a significant step down from the singles from 'Grand' just as those were a step down from OPM. Regardless there is just nothing here to attract new fans or warrant a couple superficial listens from existing STreets fans. Skinner sounds weak here and his topic change from middle class to the lives of the rich and famous just isn't interesting. There's no believability here; and even if the album is a parody it's an unlikeable one. The mysanthropy anger and satire here are lazy and unbearably frustrating. After two albums that were as great as they were the slip is understanding. But it's dissapointing nonetheless and the absence of the old Skinner is striking and not in a good way. ",2.0

When I was reading Warriors I was reminded of another epic cat story Tailchaser's Song; but everything in Warriors seemed merely a poor copy compared to that book. In Tailchaser's Song the cats are beautifully crafted and fantastic while still keeping the mannerisms and solitude of the cats you know. In Warriors the cats are more reminiscent of the creatures from Redwall with their colonies and social structure.Even the plot of Warriors seems inadequate. The characters are very 2 dimensional and stereotyped and the climax of the story is very small. The author styled the climax so that it was the conclusion of a minor conflict in the plot while the major conflicts were left unanswered. I am reminded of easy-reading children's books that have little to no climax.Warriors is a rather short book so I am wondering why the author didn't combine several books in the series and thereby avoid the unforgivable plot mistake of leaving loose ends untied. Of course Warriors is a low reading level book so the author probably wanted it to be small in order to not scare away anyone shy of reading.However I am suspicious that the author chopped the plot into pieces so the readers would have to buy more books than their money's worth to get any closure.If you like small books or children's books then Warriors is the book for you.But if you are a reader with a voracious Tolkein-sized appetite you might find better entertainment elsewhere.

It has his signature unparalleled beauty but is also unusually thoughtful with intriguing musings on illusion vs. reality and the nature of love beauty and art. Keats' lament about empiricism destroying natural wonder has heavily influenced everyone from Edgar Allen Poe to Richard Dawkins and Lamia remains central to the art/nature vs. science debate. The story is also interesting in itself; Keats brings a fantasy world vividly to life draws us in emotionally and even has a devastating ending. Finally the poem is impressive technically showing Keats' growing couplet mastery.

But then all it really amounts to is 232 pages of defensiveness repeating over and over that failure is just a part of life and experimentation and if we don't want to stagnate we have to expect cracks and collapses so don't blame the hapless engineer for trying to forward human achievement. Yes engineers and designers can sometimes be the scapegoats for failures beyond their control but he makes a weak case and uses this argument to eclipse the real causes and analyses of structural failure. The author cites very few actual examples analizes the same few examples over and over and his one or two attempts at discussing novel failures--such as cracks in a set of kitchen knives--go nowhere since it's pure speculation with no actual research. What's most glaring is his almost complete neglect for the basic role of cost-cutting measures in leading businesses to ignore testing quality control maintenance and basic oversight the domination of engineering and science by capitalism putting profits before safety an essential component he barely touches. In a book supposedly written for the lay person the illustrations which are critical for understanding the examples he refers to are few and far between. Some of the major examples he cites such as the collapse of the Hartford Civic Center roof or the John Hancock building windows failure in Boston aren't illustrated at all. And for a mostly polemical work there are surprising inconsistencies--in the last chapter he says that that exposing engineering failure are a credit to the profession only to cite on the next page an engineering conference on structural failure that refused to publish any results.

So many examples are all really of much the same thing and the author seemed to have hardly bothered doing any homework. Even when he mentions a couple of aircraft accidents he manages to find ones that were the result of a structural failure and not any of the other non-structural but still engineering factors that can and do contribute to accidents (even back in 1982 when aircraft were much simpler).Here is a concise version of the book summed up in a single quote from an attorney",2.0
" In the interest of being fair I have to at least say that this book has an excellent goal. Explaining that failures are to be expected and that engineering is a thoroughly human endeavour is extremely important and I admire the author's decision to try and get the information across. That being said I don't think we'll find a single worse way to get the information across. Petroski's way of writing is boring dry and completely humorless. I find myself thinking of that math teacher we all had who cracked lame jokes and laughed at them when no one else did. He presents examples that are obvious and boring and expects us all to just drink it in.Ultimately I think that this book is clearly written by an engineer and not someone who likes to write. I myself am an engineering student and I recognize the work of someone who has no interest in english class. Petroski sadly has no idea how to write or how to captivate a reader. He seems to blindly stumble past legitimately interesting points only to continuously drone on about Speak n' Spells and Bridges.It was a thoroughly disappointing book written mostly about boring and uninteresting ideas and written in a most boring and uninteresting way.

" The author took 232 pages to state what could have been said in 23 pages. He uses nursery rhymes and Greek mythology to 'explain' the publics expectation that some machines and structures fail!?! He would have been better served going into more details of the few cases he revisits repeatedly. As a working engineer I found his explanations of how complex systems should be developed very off base. What happened to incremental design improvements testing instrumentation quality control and design reviews? ",2.0
" This is a great book but it lacks scientific evidence and it rests it's theories on one experiment conducted by the author the experiment itself was hardly done under the strict standards of the scientific community he didn't even have a control group by what is he comparing it with!! I can see why so many people can get sucked in by it but the empirical mind will see it for what it is. It does have intresting theories but with very little (if any ) concrete evidence. ",2.0
" Basically here's the thing- the first 12 tracks are hard to find vintage buddy holly and showcase his early country roots. These aren't the best quality but they're absolutely essential to any serious Buddy Holly collection. Now that being said i found the latter 10 tracks to range from 'okay' to 'tremendously awful'. Not any fault of Holly himself- the problem here is POINTLESS AND ANNOYING OVERDUBS. What you're hearing isn't Buddy Holly as he sounded but someone else's idea of what he SHOULD have sounded like. Tracks like 'Love Is Strange' and 'You're The One' are almost COMPLETELY RUINED by obnoxious and out-rightly GOOFY sounding strings overdubs while 'Slippin' And Slidin' and 'Smokey Joe's Cafe' suffer from horribly un-authentic sounding backing tracks. They would have done MUCH better by simply presenting Buddy's original recordings as they were without the hideous and gaudy additions of newer musical arrangements placed ON TOP of the original un-marred performances. Frankly I would sooner recommend searching out a bootleg recording rather than see anyone pay good money for a DOCTORED Buddy Holly album. Pretty disappointing. ",2.0

Still this was a big dissipointment. First twenty minutes you really want to see Drake. You don't get to see him hatch. Drake was a young dragon that looks like a cartoon. The scam is that the cover has a picture of a realistic dragon. I expected better considering the first Dragonheart was very realistic. Were did Drake come from. I thought Draco was the last one. The two chinise people you don't know if they are good or bad. The karate scenes were stupid and unrealistic. Dragons spiting ice is a bad idea. They can't breath fire and ice. The end battle bettween Drake and the evil dragon who is too small Drake won too easily. The picture quality was hard to tell from the VHS. The first dragonheart had great picture quality. The sound was good at least. The supplements were good telling the story how it was made. If you like dragonheart don't buy this. ",2.0
" I wouldn't have bothered to read this if I had realized that it's just a teaser for King's new TV show. The 'story' ends abruptly with no resolution presumably to make one sure to tune in to get one which makes me feel cheap and used. I'd probably be more disgruntled but I didn't actually purchase the book.Other than that it's not an abysmally bad story but it's not great or ground-breaking either. The plotline seemed a little too generic for King which makes more sense now that I have read that it's a re-interpretation of a work by Von Trier.I think some of King's work is really excellent but I would rank this towards the bottom of his writings. That said being ranked low for King is better than some author's best especially in the 'horror' genre. ",2.0

" Okay I got this movie at the library. Now everybody told it was horrible but I had to see it myself. I've only just flicked through a couple of the scenes but what I have seen is enough. First of all most of the sets that I've seen are AWFUL! For example watch the 'Jacob and Sons/Joseph's Dreams' scene. It looks like it was a computer graphic! Is it? Why? Also the costumes! Why is the narrator in sneakers and what's with her shirt? You really have to see it to believe it. She can't really sing either. The kids look so gray and drab! They could have done a much better job with this production as it was such an important milestone in the partnership of ALW and TR.Ok just listened to Potifar! What's with that phony accent? This proves it they should have a much better narrator. If you haven't seen the tour Amy Adams is great! Much better than whoever sings her part in the movie!Now what's with her doing sound effects in 'one More Angel in Heaven.' The scene is also a great example of the the set makers messed up.PS",2.0

" The original Outrun is a timeless classic. It's one of those video-games that will last forever and it came out of the golden era of wonderful arcade innovations along with Double Dragon and Splatterhouse. Outrun was the first great racer better than Pole Position on the Atari!!!There have been plenty of sequels and spin-offs to Outrun from the kinda okay Turbo Outrun to the just plain stupid Battle Outrun. None really had that extra spark which made the original so amazing. Outrun 2006 may not end up a classic but is still a brilliant game in it's own right.Rekindling that hedonistic free-spirited just-get-in-and-drive-anywhere feeling and sacrificing all the modern racing features for just sheer joyriding pleasure Outrun 2006 is just such an easily accessible game for anyone.As usual it's filled with gorgeous scenery brilliantly blue skies and amazing music. The classic 'Magical Sound Shower' (a great great tune indeed) has been remixed but it also contains the 1986 mix for the purists.The only negative thing I can say about this game is that once you've finished it 5 times (such as I have already) there's not much point in going back to the same old courses. They could have included more.Ah well it's still a game you should invest time and money in.Graphics ASound AGameplay ALasting Appeal C+ ",3.0

These are not just Thomas stories but a mixture of episodes supposedly picked by children who went to the A Day With Thomas event in Penn. at some point.

You cannot skip these with the skip button; you can fast-forward but that's a hassle isn't it? This is why some customers are understandably upset.But my two-year-old actually likes the footage from the event -- set to his favorite T&F; songs -- more than the stories themselves. Most of his favorite episodes are not here so he ends up only watching the event footage and clapping every time he sees the mock-up Thomas train with all the happy children onboard.If you own few other Thomas videos I think this is a decent value with ten episodes that more or less represent the T&F; series.

And she keeps getting into trouble because he won't tell her anything just keeps patting her on the head and telling her not to worry he will protect her. Which he also doesn't do to well.

" As an avid reader of Christine Feehan I was pretty excited when 'Scarletti Curse' was published. Unfortunately the novel did not live up to expectations. Unlike Feehan's earlier novels these characters were not well-developed and the plot was relatively shallow. There were flashes of Feehan's characteristic imagination but over all it was a disappointing read. ",3.0
" For many years the Scarletti family history has been shrouded in curses and dark mysteries. Whispers of evil murder and insanity have been going around the villagers about the family that rules their lands. They say that no bride has ever survived in the palazzo and considering the number of women who have met their untimely death in what everyone has come to refer to as the Palazzo Della Morte (Palace of Death) it seemed that the curse is true.Unbeknown to the villagers the current don has set his eyes on their healer Nicoletta the woman whose identity they have protected for fear that she will be branded a witch by those who might misinterpret her gift of healing. So how did Don Giovanni Scarletti find out about their beloved Nicoletta when no one has spoken of her to outsiders? Could the rumor be true then that he has powers because he is in league with the devil?THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a dark and mysterious novel filled with suspense and sensuality. Nicoletta is a very likable heroine with her wit and exuberance. I loved the way she seemed to embrace life with such open arms. Her compassionate nature and youthful innocence is quite endearing. Giovanni's character is such a mystery. The way he treats Nicoletta with such tenderness is such a contrast from how people perceived him to be.I must say though that even though the author has done well in describing the atmosphere within the palazzo including the design and architecture lending to the eeriness of the story there were some parts that dragged a bit. I also didn't care much about the political intrigue and thought that it wasn't blended in well with the story. I might have understood it more had the author bothered to actually tell us which date the story was meant to have happened (I'm only guessing 15th or 16th century). I know this seems trivial but when I'm reading a historical novel I do like to know what period it's supposed to be.Overall this wasn't a bad book. I did enjoy the banter between the don and his barefoot bride. You can read about Giovanni and Nicoletta's descendant Antonietta Scarletti in Dark Symphony (which I'm reading at the moment). ",3.0
" This was a great book! But the dialogue between Nicoletta and her guardian just seem to drag on forever! I missed the intense dialogue that Feehan usually devotes to the two leads. It seemed that they had very little interaction except for the last 1/4 of the book. Why such devotion to this mother-daughter relationship when it didn't seem to lead to anything crucial within the story? It really detracted from the couple's story. Other than that the two leads were great and I agree with previous entrys - PLEASE write a book on the other brothers. ",3.0
" At first it was interesting because the character Nicoletta was a free spirit who vowed never to be married to anyone who would subject her to abuse or become servile to. It was when she met Don Giovanni Scarletti she sensed something evil about him and his family. Don Scarletti had possession of her mind body and soul. His dark features were erotic yet frightening to Nicoletta. However I have found myself getting a little bored with the book. It seems as if something that is bound to happen doesn't happen. It's a good read but unfortunately I am getting restless and impatient with the Scarletti curse and the passionate fires between Nicoletta and Don Giovanni. ",3.0

" I enjoy Ms Feehan's general writing style and loved every one of the Dark Series books...but this gothic started very slow. For over a hundred pages I still felt like the background was still being set and the real story hadn't begun. Finally she gets to the gothic mansion and I felt that THAT is when the story began. Once at this point the plot seems to take up some speed and has a lot of suspense and gothic darkness. Although some questions are answered I felt like she could have taken some of the characters a bit further. I also felt like some of the scenes were startlingly switched for the suspense and I had to go back and re-read a page again to figure out what was going on. I wouldn't re-read this again but would still probably want to try her next gothic to see how that one goes. ",3.0

If you like the Dark series I would recommend that you read this one if you have nothing else around to read .... ",3.0
" This book read a little too much like a toned down book from her Dark series for me to really enjoy it. Like the men in her other series the hero is laboring under a dark shadow and needs that special one woman to make his life light.

There were also a lot of minor characters with many names that the reader has to keep straight.Also while Nicoletta's supernatural powers were explained pretty well one never really gets to understand why Giovanni has them or where they come from.But all of that being said it was creepy and certainly kept me reading.

" While I still enjoy listening to this song 20 years after its release it is not my favourite Heart album. I believe their best work lies in the music they released in the 70's from the Dreamboat Annie Little Queen Dog and Butterfly Bebe Le Strange and Greatest Hits/Live albums.Heart can rock - they still rock to this day and the 1985 Heart album was a commercial success complete with the big hair glam make-up and power ballads but in my opinion that wasn't Heart. That was a marketing recipe for success for Capitol records. The music although entertaining radio-friendly and sometimes charged (What About Love Never If Looks Could Kill Shell Shock) is not organic or idealistic. Lyrically the songs are weak and trite and don't represent the depth and breadth of Ann and Nancy's earlier songwriting talents. Their musical catalogue on Capitol does not compare to the gems they released on the Mushroom & CBS-Portrait labels.I still listen to this album occasionally to remind me of my youth but if I want to hear the REAL Heart I listen to their earlier albums. ",3.0
" It is my opinion that Heart was never the same after the Wilson sisters dismissed lead guitarist Roger Fisher (Anne's former beau) and producer Mike Flicker. This was evident on their first album without their involvement Bebe LeStrange (80). Fisher had a co-writing credit on one track but he did not appear on the album. From that point on Heart had lost their edge. At the same time their commercial appeal was slipping. They made Private Audition (82) and Passion Works (83) but failed to have any significant hits. They were subsequently dropped from CBS (Sony) records.As a matter of survival in the record business Heart had everything riding on the success of this self-titled Capitol album. Producer Ron Nevison encouraged the Wilson sisters to use songs from outside writers and he made Heart sound like Survivor with female lead vocals. I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy most of the songs on this album. 'What About Love' 'Never' and particularly Bernie Taupin's 'These Dreams' are very catchy pop tunes. Incidentally 'These Dreams' was orignally written for Stevie Nicks who rejected it. Heart had their first number one song three more top ten singles and an additional Hot 100 hit from this record which proves my point -- this is pure pop. Of course that's not bad it's just different.For those of us who were fans from the beginning the HEART album bears little resemblance to the rocking and soulful 70's band that made the classics Dreamboat Annie (76) Little Queen (77) Magazine (78) and Dog and Butterfly (78). If you only know Heart from this 1985 pop album you owe it to yourself to hear them the way they were. ",3.0
" While this album certainly isn't the same music Heart was known for in the 70s it brought them back into the music spotlight and brought new fans. Some people who like to act self important wanna call this type of change 'selling out' but look at all the other bands of the past who refused to change - most of them are nowhere and forgotten. Very few bands of that era have a sound that maintains through time. Put 'bands of the 70s' in your search browser and see what comes up. There's maybe 5 bands on that list that continued to produce music successfully thru the 80s and 90s. And Heart is one of them. When it comes to entertainment if you wanna survive you gotta give the fans what they want. And that's what Heart did on this disc and a few more after this. ",3.0
" This is a review of the 1990 Capitol CD version of this album. In short this is a very good album but the sound quality of the CD is mediocre at best and is in need of remastering. In fact the sound quality is very weak in comparison to the excellent remastered 'Little Queen' 'Dog & Butterfly' and 'Bebe Le Strange' CDs released by Epic/Legacy. Compared to my vinyl LP purchased back when the album was first released this CD sounds quite tinny with overdone highs and a great lack of midrange.As far as the music itself this is a solid effort and was Heart's biggest seller going 5X Platinum (per Wikipedia). It was a departure from the band's earlier albums as they went through a change in record label and with that came a new producer (Ron Nevison) new sound (heavier use of synth; less use of acoustic guitar) and new songwriters (emphasis on outsiders instead of the Wilson sisters). While I prefer the older albums this is still very good and worth a listen. In fact based on relative record sales most people prefer this version of Heart to their original approach.So overall 4 stars for the music 2 stars for the sound quality giving an overall rating of 3 stars.

" Being a huge Heart fan since the release of 'Dreamboat Annie' in 1976 I was not sure what to make of this 1985 self-titled album.

They were no longer the folky blusey rockin band I grew up with - - now they were a huge hit machine with lots of pop/rock hits and huge hair. This album is however expertly executed. It accomplished its goal in spades - - turn Heart into a pop/rock hit making machine. All the songs here are good and Ann and Nancy and the band are in top form.

" This is somewhat of a minority viewpoint in comparison to the previous five customer reviews already written. I read this book because of the local publicity it received here in Wisconsin the fact that I have been in Peru and in Amazon region (though not the same part as Dr. Linnea) am interested in Latin American culture and speak fluent Spanish.Dr. Linnea doesn't. The one complete Spanish sentence in the book contains a major grammar error that most students wouldn't make mid-way through their first semester of college Spanish. Of the isolated Spanish words she uses she gets a couple wrong. She can be forgiven for this. She obviously managed to communicate adequately with her patients and she's a physician after all not a linguist. I'm aware this seems like nitpicking and this is not my reason for a mere 3-star review.What I find lacking in this book is emotional engagement with the reader. I liked this book passably but wanted to like it so much more. Dr. Linnea is really the only character in it and she seems to be a rather private person. She gives us her opinions much more than her feelings. Maybe this is typical of the majority of physicians. We never really get to know her patients or any other person in the book. If she develops close relationships we don't learn of them. Some patients improve and survive some die but it's a bit like a catalogue of people who barely have names or faces and come through her office (or she goes to them). I'm also interested in medicine and geography in general and a book in a similar vein that of a doctor practicing 'backwoods medicine' that is truly wonderful (and that I'd hoped this one would resemble) is Dr. Abraham Verghese's MY OWN COUNTRY. (He treats AIDS patients in Appalachia in the mid-1980s.) Perhaps he's atypical in the way he becomes personally/emotionally involved with his patients or in the way that he is able to put human faces and lives on a disease and write about it all. Dr. Linnea in spite of being a wonderful person who has done dangerous extremely outstanding work is not able (or chooses not) to do what Verghese did in his book.Unlike another customer who reviewed this I definitely don't think this was ghost-written. Dr Linnea is right there revealing not one iota more than she wants to. I think the 'problem' can be seen right in her acknowledgements when regarding her publishers she writes that they 'gave me unlimited latitude in what I wanted to say and how I wanted to say it.' Sorry but this book needed much more editorial guidance. She's a physician not a professional writer and though this effort is quite passable it could have been so much better.The book is informative educational up to a point gives a good perspective on 'jungle' medicine' vs. the US mainstream practice thereof and is culturally sensitive. (Though at one point I winced when she said that the inhabitants almost all of whom live in abysmal poverty 'seemed happy.' This made me think of 19th century slaves in the US who many contended 'seemed happy.') There are a few funny moments especially when Dr. Linnea describes w/ dead-on accuracy her encounters with the Peruvian bureaucracy redtape and corruption.All in all well worth reading but don't expect great emotional engagement or gripping human drama.

" I bought this case about 3 years ago when I graduated with my M.Arch degree. I keep it in a small pocket inside my purse which is rather protected and over time it has deteriorated. The pin that is in the hinge constantly slips out and I have to push it back in I find it difficult to open with such a small tab and the clear cover (acrylic?) has cracked in several places. I find it quite awkward to hand out cards at a moment's notice because I have to turn it just right in order to get a good grip to open it.

" David Remnick's 'Lenin's Tomb' is a book about the journalist's experiences just before and during the collapse of the USSR at the end of the 1980s. Using a chronological overview Remnick describes what the Soviet Union was like under the reign of Gorbachov (or 'Gorbachev' in US spelling) and his views on the various leaders journalists KGB officers bureaucrats dissidents and so on.Because Remnick goes almost entirely by interviews for his information the book gives a very thorough biographical view of the times but there is very little information on the general state of the country economic and social causes for the collapse and so on. Remnick's tone and style are very much like those of a tabloid investigative journalist describing people and events mostly by way of the author's opinions and what the people he interviews look and act like. This has the benefit of giving one the impression of re-living the interactions with the famous of those years but is far too shallow for any explanatory purpose.Additionally Remnick has too obvious favorites among the people involved. Gorbachov is generally shown more negatively than often in the West but that fits the overall negative appraisal given to him in Russia. But people like Yeltsin and Solzhenitsyn are praised endlessly and can practically do no wrong even though there are serious issues with both. Sakharov in particular is elevated literally to the level of a modern saint by Remnick",3.0

I spoke with an individual in customer support who stated the average probe lasts approximately one year then needs to be replaced(an error message comes up rendering the unit unusable).

" It seems that once a month we get a re-packaging of Little Richard's 1964-65 recordings. The latest but not greatest set of retreads is the above-named CD.The only selling point for Richard collectors in the uncommon mix on 'My Wheels They Are Slippin' All The Way' [aka 'My Wheel's Been Slippin''] the Country Rock number originally left on the shelf for ten years. The horn section is audible on this album opener. Track two 'It Ain't Whatcha Do' is the original flip-side of his third single for the label an under-produced dance floor offer and this reduced echo version is welcome.It's been said many times that Richard's work for this label is inconsistent but that doesn't mean that several sides aren't absolutely essential listening for *any* R & R fan or historian. There are a few masterpieces including the uptempo 'Dance What You Wanna' (co-written by Sam Cooke) and 'Talkin' ' bout Soul' (written by Sam's Manager and Richard's Manager-to-be J. W. Alexander). On the ballad side we have the monumental 'I Don't Know What You've Got But It's Got Me' the Don Covay composition recorded by LR in New York City May 1965 and including support by Jimi Hendrix (then known as Maurice James) Billy Preston and Don himself on harmony vocal. Incredibly the most important track on this double CD and maybe the most important Soul ballad every released is presented here with an unnecessary fade which excludes the expolsive final forty seconds.

" I was really looking forward to getting this book but I have to admit I was somewhat disappointed. It is obviously a labor of love but I would recommend it only for Heinlein fans who have already read most of the Grand Master's works.It basically consists of an alphabetical listing with comments on all of the published works of RAH and it appears to be quite comprehensive. Some of the remarks and anecdotes are very interesting but virtually all of them assume that you are already familiar with the plot of the particular story or novel. This is why I recommend it only for die-hard fans. It is no help at all for the reader who has read only a couple of Heinlein's works. I think there should have been at least a basic plot synopsis for each item so those folks could have been pointed to Heinlein pieces that would have been new to them that they might have found interesting.No work not even Starship Troopers or Strangers in A Strange Land gets more than three or four pages of comments (most are less than a page) and the book is only about 250 pages long. Rather pricey too. ",3.0
" 'Hum Saath-Saath Hain' is reminiscent of some of the other family-centered Hindi dramas of the 1990s such as 'Hum Aapke Hain Kaun' and it preceded the very popular 'Khabi Khushi Khabhie Gham' which deals with similar themes. These themes are family unity; obedience to parents; loyalty to siblings; and the potential for family erosion when doubt and suspicion creep in.The family at the core of this film is comprised of mother father and three sons who all live happily together and work for the prosperous family business (there's also a daughter but she's already married and therefore lives with her husband's family). The family functions according to a strict but loving hierarchy in which the eldest son Vivek (Mohnish Behl) marries first and is set to inherit the top position in the family firm; the second son Prem (Salman Khan) is sent abroad to study so that he can also join the company; and the youngest son Vinod (Saif Ali Khan) is mischievous but always looks up to his elder brothers.The first two hours of this three hour film are without any major family strife or drama - the focus is on the daily functioning of the family and the pairing off of each brother with his respective sweetheart. Vivek Prem and Vinod all get engaged in turn as the couples sing dance and bat their eyelashes at each other over the course of two hours. When Preeti bakes sweets for Prem (his favorite sweets of course!) that counts as high drama. If the intricacies of life in an extended family hold no interest for you then you will likely be bored to tears. If however you enjoy delicate flirtations and the visual feast that is Hindi cinema then it will be a pleasant two hours.The twist doesn't come until the final hour. When the daughter of the family experiences some difficulties in her husband's home the mother becomes paranoid that a similar schism will occur in her own family carefully balanced as it is between three brothers and their three wives-to-be. In a moment of doubt the mother causes the very schism she's afraid of but under the pretense of protecting her two younger sons from the power of the elder (who's also only their half-brother). I'm not giving away anything shocking when I say that all will be resolved in the end since the very foundation of this film is the idea that family bonds should never be broken and this family in particular is unbreakable.All of the actors turn in fine performances; surprisingly no one actor is the star over any other. Salman Khan plays the shy gentle brother and as such his performance is more subdued than usual. Mohnish Behl is great as the always-responsible noble elder brother and Saif Ali Khan is credible as the playful responsibility-dodging youngest brother. The three women (Tabu Sonali Bendre and Karishma Kapoor) are lovely but they don't have much scope for nuance in their roles; they are all dutiful loving women who act appropriately and obediently. Not much room for drama in such idealized characterizations.In summary",3.0

" This guy is almost cut like Schwarzenegger but has no sense of humor. Decent action like some of Arnold's early works (e.g. Commando and Red Heat) but not the best acting just like them. If you got a couple hours to blow and want to see a new action movie this will fit the bill. I suggest rental as this does not have alot of replayability in my book. Even my two young stepsons that were Marines weren't impressed. A good popcorn no brainer action movie. If you own any of Schwarzenegger's movies your time would be better spent watching them again. Don't get me wrong I really hope that Cena's career in movies will continue. With time I'm sure his acting will improve as Schwartzenegger's did. Let's face it the movie had potential if the acting was better or they threw in more comedy. About the only funny thing in the movie was when one of the bad guys says 'He's like the Terminator' when talking about the Marine and then Robert Patrick who played a Terminator in 'Terminator 2' gives a steely glance at him. If this turns out to be the only movie Cena makes I have to vote for 'Chill Factor' with Skeet Ulrich or 'Firestorm' with Howie Long over this one. If they had added in more humor I think it would have worked better.Story Synopsis",3.0

" The Marine is a film about a marine that has just been discharged and is back home with his wife. When she's kidnapped by the bad guys the game is on. It's an action movie and I think most people can spot what this movie is going to be like from that description. So if you're not a person that enjoys action movies like Rambo or Commando then I can safely say that you won't enjoy this film. It's still a paint-by-numbers affair so it's doubtful you'd suddenly find yourself enjoying this type of film.But I am someone who enjoys action movies like Rambo and Commando. So I waited till I found myself in the right mood to watch an action romp and I stuck this DVD in. The movie starts out with some promise. After John Cena's character is discharged from the military he takes a job as a security guard. The scene that followed that was fairly entertaining - with Cena throwing around his weight. While that scene is entertaining it is also meant to show that Cena's character is miserable outside of marine life. This hints at some inner turmoil that is then left behind completely and never again brought up in the film.Robert Patrick does a great job as the bad guy. I thought he was very good. I did not care for his henchmen as they didn't seem to bring anything to the table. Likewise John Cena is not an actor. He doesn't need to be in an action movie if the plot is compelling but it's really not. There aren't any memorable action scenes that stick out in my mind as I reflect back so all I am recalling is the awkward delivery that John Cena had. I also didn't care for his character's wife; who was very attractive but had a quality about her that said there was nothing going on upstairs. The pair is not a couple who are developed characters; the wife especially comes off as an arrogant shrew and so as a viewer I'm not invested in the film when she is kidnapped.All in all this movie would have been a better film as a focus on Robert Patrick's jewelery store heist and escape. That was much more interesting than The Marine and his walk through a swamp. But that's just my opinion.sincerelyR.C. ",3.0
" The storyline is good but developing the characters of the 'bad guys' was quite pathetic. No depth no brains just blow up things at random and find things to bicker and whine about... Especially trying to bring racism into the fray... lets blame the senseless violence on the 'black guy'. The character happened to be a black guy and had a penchant for self-destruction... and blowing everything else up as well. I personally found that little whining episode offensive no matter how you chose to interpret it.The character development of John Triton was pretty good but established him as more of a loose cannon rather than a highly skilled combat individual. This is further reinforced when he gets into fights and essentially uses his face to block many of the punches. That may work in the WWE but does not establish a character who is supposed to be highly skilled in hand/hand combat.Some of the scenes in the movie seemed to be filler to get minutes. Especially his encounter with the two poachers while running through the swamp.However the movie still managed to be fun to watch once I was able to adjust my expectations for the movie to be WWE entertainment and not as a full action movie.Overall you can enjoy this movie if you choose to it isn't a total loss but neither is it a winner.

" What a surprise. This film contains outstanding dialog. It's pretty funny. It does get boring later in the film perhaps there's a lack of content or grounding and the outstanding dialog seems to become average. The film makers seem to understand our boredom and presto change-o many car crashes and explosions. Their trickery seems to work.I will say this film does nothing for race relations. Especially if you take the film makers seriously. The black villain in the story is such a stereo-type of the bad guy obsessed with getting in touch with his blackness. Arch-type - that's what he is. Not a stereotype but a stand in for all African Americans or rather the personification of a certain ideology. Perhaps just a reality. This may be done intentionally that's my opinion.

" Some might say that professional wrestlers are already actors to some extent. WWE Studios is dedicated to expanding the careers of those with acting talent from the ring to the big screen. As a champion John Cena brought an imposing physical presence rugged good looks and a certain flair for the dramatic to his wrestling and music endeavors. The Marine (2006) is a vehicle designed to showcase Cena's talents and he acquits himself well enough in his big screen debut an explosive and exciting but still rather unremarkable action thriller.Cena is ex-Marine John Triton discharged from the service for disobeying orders while on a mission in Iraq. Returning stateside Triton finds civilian life a little rough and decides to get away from it all for a while heading into the South Carolina mountains with his wife Kate (Kelly Carlson Nip/Tuck).At a roadside gas station a gang of thieves on the run ambush a couple of highway patrolmen. With their vehicle damaged the criminals led by Rome (Robert Patrick) and his lieutenant Angela (Abigail Bianca) slug John kidnap Kate and hit the road in Triton's SUV. Triton gives chase in the patrol car in what is the action highlight of the first half of the film. The gang is left travelling on foot through the swamp with Triton on their trail. The group make their way to a safe house. Triton arrives and takes out some of the gang but Rome sets off and explosion and makes his escape. Triton again has to dodge a fireball and after borrowing a police speedboat finally catches up to Rome. Up until the finish Cena's fight scenes are fairly routine but the battle between Cena and Patrick finally generates a few sparks.Although the story is rather simplistic and uncomplicated The Marine does entertain and provides the requisite opportunities for John Cena to flex his muscles and exercise his fledgling acting skills. Robert Patrick (The Unit Terminator 2) is a known talent and brings some humor and class to the production and he has enough physical stature to take on Cena. Kelly Carlson (who should be in more films) and Australian Abigail Bianca mix it up in a couple of spirited fights.Working with director Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger Die Hard 2) the acting potential that is shown here is more fully realized in Cena's next film 12 Rounds (2009). Though he is still chasing after a girl Cena's character is more well rounded and the film features more of Cena doing his thing behind the wheel of a vehicle. ",3.0

" The Marine is about a marine (John Cena) who is kicked out due to not following orders well. He then gets fired from his security job after man handling a jerk. He then stresses to his friend that 'being a marine is what he did best'. Then on a trip with his wife she's taken hostage by jewel thieves. They carry big guns and blow stuff up but while acting like the kind of baffoons you'd see in a Home Alone movie. Robert Patrick is cool as the leader of the bad guys but he gets so many goofy lines that it's hard to take him seriously. I think he's a wasted actor. I mean his performance in Walk the Line and other serious roles show that. Plus no he did not kill the X-Files like many fans say. The show trying to continue without Mulder killed the X-Files. He was pretty good in it.Anyway this movie doesn't know if it's an action thriller or action comedy. Plus I don't know why people praise the stunts. It's like wannabe Transporter or Transporter 2 type action. Plus with so many huge explosions you'd think that at least one person would die in them. But John Cena escapes every huge explosion without a mark on him.We also have seen how many movies where the heroe takes one bad guy at a time as one after another goes looking for him one after another. It worked a lot better for Die Hrad than it does for this film though. Now the good about the movie. It offers sexy women and although I'm not the biggest John Cena fan I can't say he's a bad action star. He has the right look even if he does basically give a one note performance. He's a marine and he makes sure we think of him as nothing but a marine. The script also makes sure we just think of him as nothing but a dangerous marine that loves his wife too. Since that's all we ever learn about him. It's just a fast paced brainless action film so it doesn't need any character build-up. ",3.0

" This film promised lots of action. It delivered. The numerous explosions made a great spectacle. Commercial director John Bonito helmed his first feature. He keeps the pacing going well. I had no clue who John Cena was and wondered how he grabbed an action lead. After seeing the DVD extras of his wrestling career I understand how he was cast and remembered him from channel surfing. His reactions are fairly wooden without many levels that we'd expect from a more experienced actor. But he gets an 'A' for effort and completed many of his own stunts.Robert Patrick who was the bad guy in 'Terminator 2",3.0
" In the Marine John Cena plays a discharged marine who tracks down the jewel thieves that kidnapped his wife. It draws inevitable comparisons to Commando Die Hard and countless other action flics - and it doesn't shy away from that. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously and throws in knowing references to other 'blow-em up' films [including a Terminator line for the sake of lead baddie Robert Patrick]. There's nothing new or really eye popping to see here. It is a formula driven testerone fest that does all the usual things that movies like this are supposed to do and it is all pulled off fairly well. Don't go into it expecting Bourne-like intrigue; however don't be surprised if you find yourself thinking how much John Cena looks like Bourne actor Matt Damon from the neck up. If there were a Bourne spoof Cena would be a no-brainer to play the title character. ",3.0

" This is rather fun to watch although it is completely over the top in being unrealistic.Although most action shows tend to be extreme in the situations that the star survives and thrives in this one puts virtually all others to shame in that regard. That is unfortunate as it is a storyline that could have proven to be a great movie if it were written better.It features John Triton (John Cena) as a former Marine who was kicked out of the Corps for disobeying an order. Of course had he obeyed the order many American lives would have been lost. Nevertheless he was scapegoated and discharged.One day he and his wife Kate (Kelly Carlson) are at a convenience store when a group of thugs kills a cop. They then take Kate hostage which proves to be a very poor decision for them as John is a commando the makes Rambo look like a wimp in comparison. The bad guys are about to have a very bad day indeed.This really could have been a great show but there are way too many extreme fires/explosions that get Triton. If the writers would have toned that part down just a bit this might have been a four or even a five star show. Hardcore actions fans will probably enjoy it but it comes off as a bit too hokey for many others. ",3.0
" John Cena was very realisitic made the part genuine and intriguing. He really portrayed a man going out of his mind with anger at his wife being kidnapped. At the same time he was clever and covert. It is unfortunate that with his talent and great looks he was given a substandard plot. He has untapped skills and a charisma that could make him a tremendous movie star in a story that is unique and capitalizes on his expertise. ",3.0
" The special effects were great and the production is pretty darn good. By the end of the movie you realize the hero should've died a long time ago but then again that's what action movies are all about. Near the end he takes a sledgehammer to the gut which would've pretty much put most people out of commission. He's nearly blown up 3 times lives through a car chase where the car ends up being swiss cheese torn to pieces. The acting wasn't too bad but they tried to put humor in that I think only a WWE fan would appreciate. There was one funny moment I liked that referenced Terminator. It's a decent action movie if you just put logic aside and enjoy the ride. I'm not a wrestling fan so most of actors were unknown to me. It's worth a rent just for the car chase. ",3.0
" I was a little disappointed in this book. I had expected something original and different. It seemed to be a summary of books I had already read.

" Having suffered the derision of fellow sci-fi fans for many years I recently picked up the Foundation Trilogy for the first time; I was actually pretty disappointed by my first exposure to Asimov's longer works. Obviously the man is one of the renowned masters of science fiction because he got there first",3.0
" Foundation came to me highly recommended. I am not new to science fiction but I have not read that much of this genre. I was looking forward to something that would really blow my mind away. though I admired several things about the book and thought it was a nice read I am not going to read the other books in this series. Coming away from this book I felt it was good but not much more. There were several ways in which I clearly found the book to be lacking. Though Asimov's style is surely concise and highly readable he views plot as the central element to his writing at the expense of other aspects of great fiction that really should have been incorporated. I will outline these at length because it appears that the book's praises are already sung widely.First there is not much character development. Characters are presented merely to accomplish a historical event in the flow of the story. We get a feel for the characters not as real people but as actors on the stage of world history. Though the reader admires the nerve and intellect behind each of these heroes there is little else that makes them interesting. While this kind of presentation of characters may work in movie adaptations or history textbooks I like to view my characters as a little more than men at work. Everybody is always scheming there's not much downtime or description of what day-to-day life is like with these guys so far in the future such far-off planets.Secondly there is a lack of real meaning or symbolism that defines great books. The closest we get to intrinsic meaning is the description of the false religion that Salvor Hardin invents. And this only helps us understand what the author probably thinks about organized religion. The all-importance of nuclear energy also seems like propaganda to get ther reader to 'understand' how important it will be in our era with no attention paid to other kinds of fascinating technology that may exist in the future such as super-intellect robotics biotechnology etc. I don't know if Asimov was just lacking in creativity because with the exception of his brilliant description of the mother planet Trantor the only thing different between this far off future and nowadays is the ability to jump through space.Thirdly romance does not play a role in the book. There no women in the book which means there can be no romantic intrigue or world events influenced by a woman. Also there is no sense of wonder and excitement that a reader surely hopes to get when they enter an author's imagination. The landscape of these far off worlds is sparesely and hardly described. We spend much of our time in staterooms.On the other hand if you like books that are centered on brilliant leaders of nation-states and how their decisions affect the course of history you will like this book. If you are fascinated by the economic political and sociological macroforces that shape history you will like this book. If you're more about the game than the players you will like this book. ",3.0
" The main reason I read sci-fi is to visualize strange new worlds and places. Although a good book I didn't really get a good mental picture of the different worlds involved in it except Trantor in the very beginning of the book. It was mostly about people and politics with very little of the landscapes they lived in. I guess that is why I liked the Dune and Hyperion series so much. ",3.0
" Being a science fiction fan for some years I picked up a copy of Foundation after hearing wonderful things about this series and loving I Robot. On the whole I think I Robot is a better read largely because I got to know and empathize with the characters in that set of stories more which is my main criticism of this book.Nevertheless Foundation is still very worthwhile and while I wouldn't recommend this book to everyone there are certain friends who I think would love it - it's for a select audience who loves science fiction and/or Isaac Asimov. I am going to continue on with the series - and we'll see how it goes! ",3.0
" The key to enjoying the original Foundation trilogy is to understand that the three novels which make up the 'trilogy' are not really novels. They are a series of interconnected stories written over time. Foundation is actually 5 short stories. Because of this the stories vary in quality.The second book Foundation and Empire is actually two stories. The first is called The General and tells the story of the empire's last ditch effort to conquer the foundation. The weakness of the first story is that all the action takes place off page. We never see any of the actual combat we just read the characters talking about it. Also the resolution comes way too quickly. It feels like Asimov had reached his page limit and decided to end the story as quickly as he could.The second story called The Mule is the real draw here. All the previous stories presented a challege for the foundation to overcome. However it was always expected that the foundation would triumph based on the long term scientific predictions of its founder. The Mule throws in a variable that was not predicted. The appearance of a mutant who swiftly moves to conquer the various planets left in the wake of the old empire's collapse. Ultimately he sets his sights on the foundation. The best part of the story is a visit to the ruins of the planet Trantor. Former capital of the galactic empire.Having finished this second book I have come to realize that the Foundation trilogy while entertaining is certainly not Asimov's best work. Time is not always kind to science fiction and all of these early stories were written before 1950 when Asimov was still a young writer. I plan to continue on to the next book but I no longer expect to be overwhelmed by the classic status these stories have achieved. ",3.0
" I like Foundation because it's a solid piece of sci-fi from olden days. (George Lucas's stealing of Asimov's city-planet for his Coruscant - tsk tsk Georgie - amazed me most.) Foundation does have peculiarities. People hundreds of thousands of years in the future speak like us. They use phrases like us. They also have the same atomic technology as people did in the 1950s. Asimov got a bit lazy here; he could've imagined something cooler than nukes. The galaxy is a metaphor for a crumbling Roman empire. Perhaps Terminus is Ireland. As for A's style I found his use of long adverbs rather funny. In sum a good book if you can ignore this stuff. ",3.0
" I know I'll take some major heat in saying this but I wasn't that impressed with this beloved classic. Oh the idea intrigues me surely that of humankind eons in the future existing across the galaxy on a multitude of worlds so far removed from earth that eminent masters of science themselves debate whether earth was even the planet where human life began but once the dust settled from an idea that lofty what did Asimov really DO with it? He used it for unexciting little tales of science v. military might. I love the parallel between the fall of this vast space empire and the fall of Rome. The way bands of scientists struggled in a dark age to keep the light of knowledge alive was thought-provoking (which is high praise in my lexicon) but this was backdrop and the plot Asimov employed in telling the story of all this was (sorry to say) dull slow simple and unworthy of the imaginative concepts he thought up in his setting for this tale of knowledge overcoming strength of arms. I haven't read the later Foundation novels so maybe they're the ones where the brilliance of the series exists but I found this book from Sci-Fi's golden age so demanding on my patience that I didn't finish it the first time I tried to read it and barely made it to the end the second time. I wish I shared the glowing praise for this classic that millions of others claim they feel but to be honest I just don't. ",3.0
" Re-reading Foundation showed it to be rather dated in its depiction of an advanced galactic empire rooted in its 1940s science fiction environment. The overall plot such as it is betrays the novel's origins as separate short stories and the characters tend to be wooden. Foundation and Empire the next book in Asimov's original Foundation trilogy is a much better novel especially in its depiction of the character of the Mule. However the concept of psychohistory introduced in this work is fascinating and the key to the other books by Asimov and others describing past and future developments in the Foundation universe.

" The second of the first Foundation trilogy Foundation and Empire was originally published in 1952. Originally published as two novellas in Astounding Science Fiction 'The General' and 'The Mule' cover the next two periods when the Foundation receives its first full-force attacks.In 'The General' the Galactic Empire is well on its way to its inevitable end but under the command of General Bel Riose an attack is planned against the Foundation. Bel Riose has gone mad with power and will stop at nothing to obliterate the Foundation somehow believing they are behind the fall of the empire. He amounts huge forces if armored gunships with plans wipe the Foundation from the galaxy. But one man from the Foundation knows about this and he also knows knowledge is power and since the Foundation is soon as that which has all the knowledge he knows Bel Riose can be stopped so long as he gets to the Emperor before the general attacks.In 'The Mule' the Galactic Empire has fallen into a selection of barbaric kingdoms while the Foundation has become strong and powerful but also full of corruption composed of approximately thirty outer planets. But there is corruption within the ranks and things are stirring within the Foundation's empire. Meanwhile there is a new leader who has rise an enigmatic mutant known as 'The Mule' who has only known scorn and suffering and is a hardened creature who respects no one but he also has the ability to read and control people's emotions. It is up to two Foundation citizens Toran and Bayta Darell along with the Foundation's only psychologist Ebling Mis and a strange refugee clown 'Magnifico Giganticus' to search for the Second Foundation set up by Hari Seldon originally when the Foundation was created and stop this 'Mule.'Originally written on February 5 2011 Alex C.

" Isaac Asimov was one of the greatest science fiction minds of the twentieth century. He was NOT however a great writer. At times it is difficult to separate the brilliance and scope of his imaginative ideas from the pedestrian and awkward manner in which he presents them.'Foundation' the first novel in the ever-lengthening Foundation series is a collection of short stories originally published in 'Astounding' magazine. The first couple are very good but the last few are pretty uninteresting. The writing is uneven dialogue is unrealistic and characters are wooden and one-dimensional. And yet through Asimov's wonderfully creative idea of psychohistory and its use in saving a dying Galactic Empire this series became one of the best science fiction stories of all time and well worth reading.Do be careful which edition you read.

" Let's face it",3.0
" That's not saying much since I thought that 'Foundation' was pretty poor.'Foundation and Empire' was pretty good but still lacked in certainareas - mainly character development and also the first third of thebook had a very weak story line. The whole battle with the Empire bythe Foundation was very very weak I cannot stress that enough. Maybe Iwas just hoping for an epic battle between the renegade Foundation andthe dying Empire. Nothing really happened to spur the victory of theFoundation there wasn't even really a battle. But I guess that mightbe the point that Asimov was making since Seldon predicted the choicesand decisions of the Emperor about the passion that the characters hadfor the battle. It wasn't even a battle between the Empire it was somemission designed and orchestrated by some general in the navy thatthought it would be a good idea to take over the Foundation.This book also lacked in strong characterizations but not as much asthe first 'Foundation' by a long shot. The last two thirds of the bookstick with the same characters the whole time. It also enters apowerful mutant the Mule. I won't give much away about the Mule andhis plans because I don't want to spoil the book but it sets up for thesequel 'Second Foundation.' Once again the idea of the Mule is a goodidea but is somewhat poorly executed until the ened when everything isexplained about the effects the Mule has on the Foundation and thepeople in the main storyline.Get ready for 'Second Foundation' because it will probably be the bestof the first trilogy. This book is worth reading and if 'SecondFoundation' is better than this book then I will recommend the'Foundation Series' to anybody who can persist in their reading anddoesn't mind a long slow beginning.

" How can this be considered a classic? It's fun it's entertaining but it lacks so much qualities all classics have!The Mule was a disappointment. I knew from the beggining who he was.

My final complaint about FOUNDATION is that most of the characters are presented as simple minded. I might read the rest of the books in this series only because I have been told they get better.

" While I believe that Asimov was a great science fiction author I was disappointed in this book and the whole series. To me science fiction is about new ideas of the future and an exciting story. While the idea of a falling society where some foresee the downfall of its society and plan to minimise the impact is interesting it could have been staged as well in the past. One can tell that the book has been written some while ago and it is missing the action and technologies I want to read about in a science fiction book today. For me personally the book is also very slow paced and not engaging enough to make me want to continue reading it but rather read some chapters at a time and then I can put it down for weeks since I am not engaged enough to read further. Still I am kind of interested in how the series continues and finally ends but not interested enough that I have to use every free minute reading it. I find it hard to judge this book and if you are into science fiction I believe you just have to give it a try. Yes I rated it only three stars but rating this book in a one dimensional fashion doesn't do its justice since I believe it is still a very good book but just not what I was expecting of a science fiction and wanted to read.

" From everything I've heard about this book I was really excited to read it. After reading the first half in a few days then forcing myself to finish the second half after taking a two week break I can honestly say that I found it to be a real let down.The main theme was about the only part I liked. Humanity has colonized the stars and controls everything blah blah blah but a really smart guy and his friends do some math equations and figure out that the currently all-powerful and all-encompassing Empire is doomed to collapse and thrust mankind thousands of years back to a 'barbaric' state. His solution is to gather all the great minds of the day and create an educated stronghold on the edge of the galaxy to serve as a becon of hope and enlightnenment to supposedly shorten the time mankind has to spend in the dark ages.Their main goal is to create an encyclopedia that pretty much contains every biit of information ever learned. Ever. (wikipedia)Well it turns turns out that several years after the creation of Foundation the shallow characters are riddeled with 'crises'. Good thing the late creator appears via prerecorded videos at strategic times to offer advice to the indistinguishable residents and assures them that he did some math problems fifty years ago and discovered that everyting with work itself out. This is the basis for the rest of the book.The characters are dull boring and super confident in everything they do because some dead guys math and future predictions will save them all.The second half of the book proved to be slightly more interesting but not much ",3.0
" The first thing to understand about Foundation is that it isn't really a novel. It is a collection of 5 connected short stories (The Psychohistorians The Encyclopedists The Mayors The Traders & The Merchant Princes) written in the 1940s for publication in Astounding Science Fiction Magazine. The first story in the book was actually written a few years later for repackaging the stories as the first novel in what would eventually become the Foundation trilogy (later expanded with additional books).The galactic empire is rotting. After it collapses there will follow 30000 years of barbarism. Nothing can prevent the collapse but Hari Seldon believes that the subsequent dark ages can be contained to 1000 years if the proper steps are taken. To achieve this he sets up the Foundation at the very fringes of the empire. The first two stories are far and away the best in the book and are worth the price of admission by themselves. This is because they deal directly with the central premise which is a fantastic idea.Things go downhill with the next two stories. In particular The Traders seems completely unnecessary. Things pick up a bit with the final chapter.Taken as a whole Foundation is less than the sum of its parts. I don't think it is the unrivaled masterpiece that many make it out to be. I would definitely go in with an open mind and lowered expectations.However as I mentioned earlier the idea is fantastic and promises much more and better to come. I will definitely be checking out the next book in the series. ",3.0
" Foundation and Empire is basically a continuation of Foundation. There really isn't a new plot just new problems for the Foundation to deal with. Foundation and Empire is pretty good but without the novelty of the new ideas presented in Foundation it is a bit flat.

" I recently re-read this classic work of science fiction and was pleasantly surprised to find it's still relevant today. The characters and language are a bit creaky but the social issues Asimov raises are sound. Under what conditions is it ethical for a self-appointed academic elite to hoodwink and trick the general population for their own good? Phrased that way the answer seems obvious -- under no conditions at all? -- but what if it really IS for their own good and if disaster is the alternative?We don't have any better answers to those questions today than we did 70 years ago when Asimov was writing.

" In my initial read of this book I stuck with it because it is a classic and everyone loves it. However after about half of the book I got bored nothing seemed to be building or catching so I stopped. I have restarted and am more interested now because I know some more of the background story. So far the second trip through this book is much more enjoyable than my first slow trip. ",3.0
" When a book is slated as one of the greatest Sci-Fi novels of our time it should be extremely hard to criticize. Unfortunately I found The Foundation to have more than a few flaws which actually made it a chore to read. Considering that it beat out 'The Lord of the Rings' for the Hugo Award in 1965 for best All-Time Series which is why I decided read it makes it even more insufferable in my opinion. Simply look at how momentous LOTR's has become over The Foundation in our culture and you can begin to see how it is obviously lacking something. So why does it fall short ? Well the primary reason is the story line jumps vast amounts of time chapter to chapter which even though I found refreshing it gives the reader a completely new set of characters in different settings which receive little to no development. So ultimately the visual depth as well as character depth which I find so alluring about Sci-Fi is ultimately lacking leaving little for the imagination to grasp on to. What this does do though is leave room for what I believe Asimov wanted the reader to really experience which is the psychohistorical themes built upon long term economic strategy which was wonderfully orchestrated and second to none. The thing that gets me is considering that is the focus of the story it could have just as easily taken place in the 1800's and 1900's and be based on oil or guns instead of nuclear power. Don't get me wrong the story is intriguing but if you are looking for a visually stimulating Sci-Fi book I would look elsewhere...or you can just wait for the feature film in 2013. ",3.0

FTL antigravity flying cars walnut-sized nuclear reactors laser pistols personal and city force shields egregious use of energy in the form of anti-gravity elevators) and the psychohistorian-predicts-future-events-to-the-day plot was dumb--not to mention the idea of civilizations with FTL ships incapable of harnessing nuclear power.

" This may be a classic and I may be a science fiction fan but read Asimov's 'The Gods Themselves' instead of this. His later work is definitely better. 'Foundation and Empire' is like its predecessor ('Foundation') in that you get several stories told in different periods throughout Foundation history. Everything Asimov has come up with in these books is fundamentally good sci-fi story stuff but the lack of character development makes you think while you're reading 'Why am I reading this?' I'll read the last in the trilogy ('Second Foundation') but that's as far as I'm going to go with these.For great sci-fi read 'Hyperion' 'Fall of Hyperion' 'Ender's Game' 'Childhood's End' '2001",3.0
" Asimov's entire line of work and namely the 'Foundation' novels have long been considered by some to be the gold-standard of science fiction. As an avid reader of the genre I felt implied to give the series a whirl to see what all the fuss is about and to finally spend some time with one of the grand-daddies of the golden age. So I bought 'Foundation' along with the other two novels in the original trilogy and away I went.Very boring. Very dry. Very forgettable. The problem here I think is that while Asimov had some very fantastic ideas floating around in that pioneering noggin of his he was not exactly the best at nurturing them into full-form on the page. Thus we have a series of novels that read much more like outlines of a stronger and more fleshed-out epic. The setting is grand the characters are intriguing. The plot is one for the ages. The final product however does little justice to these ideas and I found that to be vastly disappointing. All throughout I wanted more. I wanted more world-building - not necessarily technobabble and meandering Dickenson discription but at least more insight into the nature of this vast civilization apparently on the brink of collapse. Very much the same with the characters - I wanted to sympathize with Hari Seldon as he worked to keep knowledge alive in the face of ignorance but it was so hard to do so when he was presented as little more than a piece of animated cardboard. I was thinking constantly about what could have been and that put a damper on the overall effect.I think the ideas and character tropes Asimov put forth in his trilogy have been worked with by other authors and brought to life far more successfully in the years since its initial release. Novels that come to mind are Dan Simmons's awe-inspiring 'Hyperion' series and Neal Stephenson's bulky 'Anathem'. In these books great ideas are coupled with great writing. The results as much as it hurts me to say it put Asimov's original to shame.'Foundation' is a great series to read if you want to witness science fiction as it was in its infantile and supposedly-golden age. But I think that it#s nevertheless important to understand that pioneering ideas can further develop and be presented in far-superior ways as the years progress. Such is the case here. Imaginative but slow and dated. Should most certainly remain in print and continue to be read but I do not think it is the gold-standard classic it has been made out to be. Others have done much better. ",3.0
" I used to be a big fan. Somehow the first season wasn't what I remembered. Still John Ritter saved it all. I still am buying season 2. ",3.0
" I was reluctant to buy this disc because of its high price/few episodes ratio. (Come on 'All in the Family' gets 26 episodes for $30 that's under $1 per episode and that's how it should be for all TV!) However as a proceed of the purchase (how much they won't tell us hmmmm...) goes to a charity John Ritter adored I broke down tonight and bought it.After the ubiquitous FBI screen disappears I was greeted with a menu. Ignore the naysayers there is nothing wrong with how this menu works and I've used far far worse in my 300 movie collection. I rather like the menu... And the fact they have a menu option telling us of the Spring 2004 release for season 2 made my day it's nice to see they'll put out this series for the fans.Now for the transfer. Audio quality is superb well restored. Video quality is a different story. Upon freeze-framing it's very clear that despite doing a good job at restoring the master tapes they did a rather poor transfering the video to DVD. (You HDTV fans out there may not like watching this on your sets... and by 1996 the FCC is pulling the plug on current broadcast standards...) I can think of 2 reasons why the video looks as poor as it does but it suffices to say that the end result is a video image that looks needlessly grainy; broadcast video technology of the time never ever looked this bad. But while not as bad as VHS consumer quality videotape it is well below acceptable DVD quality. (for another example of what not to do in terms of transfrring video quality onto DVD check out the dithering used in 'The Best of the Chris Rock Show' - yuck!) But given the price of this disc and that 'All in the Family' costs less per episode and yet looks far better (despite NOT having had its master tapes restored) I'm knocking 2 points off. DVD video should not ever look this grainy in a freeze-frame. (it is bearable when things in motion but be prepared for a shock if you're a 'quality freak'.)6 episodes. I was pondering the same issue why not have a season 1 + 2 box set? But then we'd have to wait until spring and I hate waiting though I would have if the video looked better. Besides these episodes are HILARIOUS. The gags the double entendres the Ropers... it's all there. And when you are laughing so much you start to cry and get a stomachache you know you're watching a winner of a show that's well written and well cast. No wonder 'Three's Company' became a success so quickly. As other reviewers here and other websites post plot synopses and reviews I won't here. (well 'No Dogs No Children' was probably my favorite of the bunch especially the scene where Chrissy and Jack are in the kitchen feeding the puppy...)And the real downfall is John Ritter died an untimely death. ",3.0
" Three's Company is about as overrated as a TV show can get. First of all every single episode is about the same. How many episodes can be written on a simple misunderstanding? John Ritter was talented but this show caused him to be castwritten for the rest of his life. The guy acted gay just a little 'too' well if you ask me. The best you can say about this show is that Suzanne Somers used to jump around and jiggle without a bra.Don't be fooled by the cover. Joyce DeWitt did not look this hot until much later in the show. For now she still has the dippy-doo haircut and has the sex appeal of a cactus. The producers of the show didn't make her sexy until Suzanne left.'Larry' the used car salesman upstairs may have played a ladie's man but he was just plain scary like a werewolf. When was that hairstyle ever popular? His eyebrows seemed to reach out and grab people. The guy was as hairy as a rug too. Just looking at his arms you couldn't tell what race he was.Well John died recently while making a show with the sexiest woman on television Katey Sagal. People are saying this DVD release is a tribute to John. Poo poo I say. If Three's Company needed a much needed tribute it was to the great Norman Fell aka Mr. Roper. He was funnier than four John Ritters. I mean c'mon he had lines like 'Hey it's easy to find my wife on a nude beach she's the one that looks like her socks are rolled down!' Now that is humor my friends. So if you must buy this DVD buy it for an overlooked comedian the late great Norman Fell. ",3.0
" I expected so much from Townsend after reading a few of his other stories. However there is less bdsm content than I expected and more political/social commentary. Not a bad thing if one is more aware of the politics and social environment of the gay community in the 1970s but hard to follow and identify with otherwise. I had difficulty empathizing with any of the characters -- perhaps part of that lies with the fact that there are so many characters in the story.

" Who wouldn't watch a movie that had Mel Gibson wearing obscenely tight leather trousers and looking scarily young?Before The Passion was brought to the attention of film buffs and the press there was Lethal Weapon. And before that Mel Gibson made his name in the Mad Max movies.There's nothing on the DVD I got for my birthday not even a trailer. And I hate watching DVDs with no trailers. I'm fussy me. So I wasn't sure what to expect or what the film was exactly about. All I knew was that my mum couldn't wait to watch it and was drooling (along with me) when Mel Gibson appeared shirtless.Before the amount of money that was spent in the car chase along a freeway in Matrix Reloaded there was this. A simple but still effective car chase which introduces you very briefly to Max. I don't see the point in spending loads of money when all you need is a bunch of cars that can be trashed and a camera.Then you get to see that Max has a pretty young wife and a young child. You can almost see how the rest of the movie pans out after that. It's pretty obvious he's not mad until something really traumatic happens. I was expecting the whole growling throwing stuff but instead he seemed relatively calm - except for the sweat on his face.It's NOT obvious that this movie could get another two sequels out of it. Maybe one sequel but two? And the latter featuring Tina Turner of all people. And there's rumoured to be a fourth along with a fourth Die Hard and god knows what else. Something tells me Mel Gibson won't fit into those trousers!If you think this is going to be a movie based on revenge you're wrong. The revenge part doesn't start until about half an hour before the end.It will be interesting to see the sequels. To be honest this film did nothing for me - unless you count the tight trousers!

" In 1981 THE ROAD WARRIOR was released in to the United States and became an instant hit but George Miller's story of angry cop Max begins with his 1979 classic MAD MAX.Mel Gibson plays the title character 'Mad' Max Rockatansky a cop in a postapocalyptic future (when exactly isn't specified). He's the best cop around patroling the highways for speed-hungry gang members. Well after his best friend is killed and Max steps in the gang gets a little mad. In the end Max (now gone a little beyond Mad) sets out to avenge the death of his wife and infant child both killed by the gang.MAD MAX is a sci-fi classic that spawned one of the best-loved sci-fi series of all-time. Miller's directing style brings the needed impact to the seemingly dead futuristic earth. Gibson is also good in his star-making role (look at how young he is...wow!) - plus Brian May (not the Queen Brian May) contributes a good score.Top-notch sci-fi action entertainment and one of the greatest (and funnest) films to come out of Australia.

" In a post-apocalyptic Australia Max (Mel Gibson) and his fellow officers try to keep order on the highways as nihilistic biker gangs grow ever bolder. We are given the definite impression that the final bastions of civilization are on their last legs as chaos encroaches.This film presents intriguing characters and a suitably bleak scenario. It starts strong but it loses its energy before the end. Perhaps I was spoiled by seeing the classic action sequel 'The Road Warrior' first. When Max goes mad at the end of this first film director George Miller doesn't set the action sequences up very well or provide much of a payoff. The most exciting set pieces actually come much earlier in the movie. However his next film will prove that he can be a master of action. ",3.0
" This film is the prequel to the amazingly good 'The Road Warrior'. I've read that 'Mad Max' has the highest return on investment of any film ever made ($100K to make $100M in revenue generated); however upon watching this movie you will immediately be struck by its very low budget look and feel. If you've already watched 'The Road Warrior' you may want to watch this one to see where RW has its roots but you really need to watch RW first. Leonard Maltin (in his RW review) states that Mad Max is at least as good as RW; he is crazy. MM is a great movie for having been made for $100K but RW is a GREAT MOVIE period. One more thing this film is dubbed with American voices because someone in their infinite wisdom thought Americans wouldn't be able to understand Australian accents. This was a big mistake as the American voice actors invariably overacted in their dubbing. ",3.0
" I don't recommend this edition. Ok the picture is good and the Australian language track is quite cool but the movie is cut.In the scene in which Max visits the burned Goose in hospital has been censored meaning Goose's burned body isn't shown. Ok maybe that's something not everybody wants to see but if I buy a special edition I expect to see the whole movie. ",3.0
" It's not altogether surprising that Mad Max got such short shrift when it came out Stateside with an unfortunate dubbing job to eliminate the `Strine accents so American International could pretend it was an American film (Mel Gibson suffered perhaps a worse indignity with his screen credit moved to last position just before the lab credit on the trailers). Much of what people remember and love about Max is delivered in the sequel rather than this first outing. Indeed at times it feels more like a blueprint than a proper movie and Gibson barely registers in the surprisingly little screen time he has - the villains who all seem to be doing either premature Danny Huston impersonations or somewhat more timely German New Romantic turns make much more of an impression. Not only do huge sections of the film keep him offscreen but he makes little impact in his underwritten role when he is on. In many ways this is just a first low-budget draft of Max's world - civilization hasn't entirely crumbled yet and the precious juice is still flowing even if parts are getting hard to find. Still the car stunts are good if somewhat thin on the ground but this is one case where the sequels are definitely better.MGM/UA's special edition offers reasonable extras but they are limited by the non-involvement of George Miller and Mel Gibson and the unavailability of any archive footage. The making of featurette and audio commentary from crew members are the best of the bunch while the Gibson featurette tends to be too much of a puff piece. Despite being listed as the Australian trailer the theatrical trailer and the accompanying TV spots are all from the US release. Thankfully the original Australian soundtrack to the feature is included on this disc. ",3.0

" 'Mad Max' is one of those films that is on everyone's top film lists. Not only did it introduce us to Australian cinema but also a young 21-year old newbie named Mel Gibson. 'Mad Max' was dark it was brooding it was destructive and it never gave us that glimmer of hope for humanity but now - nearly 20 years later - does it still remain the classic that it started? Sure it was impressive to watch the crash scenes it was powerful to see the world through Mr. Miller's disturbed eyes but is it re-watchable? Does it have the appeal to see new things throughout if watched and watched again? For me the answer seemed to float near 'no'. While I loved what 'Mad Max' represented what it was - a full body of color and action - it wasn't something to be watched again and again. Gibson does a great job as Max a man torn between the evils of the road and his personal philosophies. He begins as an ominous optimist able to stop crime as it occurs on the streets but then as his sense of normality is turned upside down his ability to react and adapt is seen. The final moments he has transformed from the man we were first introduced to into something quite terrifying. One could also compliment Mr. Miller's directorial outing at times it felt a bit episodic with tough edits placed but for the majority he told a deathly story with great ease and excitement. So again there is no arguing that 'Mad Max' is an important film one that I am glad to have finally seen but once was enough. It seems to be lacking that re-watch excitement.But why has that conclusion been made? What makes 'Mad Max' mediocre instead of powerful? It is hard to pinpoint the exact scene but the sense of 'alright I've seen it - now what' was definitely present by the end. Yet there were points that I just loved. Gibson was perfect. He was incredible as Max and the world that Mr. Miller created was intense. The opening scene the car crashes as our bearded villain just yelled 'Toecutter' was fantastic. 'Mad Max' has one of those openings that just pulls you in that makes you excited to watch a film of this intensity but then where do you go? Miller seemed to indicate that more car crashes more violence more cliche family drama would indicate a stronger film. At times he was right his ability to create different scenes set across the same backdrop demonstrated his originality but then there were times where it just felt recycled. One scene that stands out is where our gang of bikers track down a couple that happens to be at the wrong place at the wrong time they chase them down and demoralize them as Max and his partner find them - then almost repetitively it happens with Max and his girl later in the film. In this post-apocalyptic world there seems to be no problem finding someone. Space seems to not be a problem. This was another unexplained moment - where the coincidence of discovering Max or finding the biker gang should have been more difficult. These repetitive essentially simplistic scenes seemed to detract from the power of what Max represented. One also needs to ask about the story the unknown of what time or place we are following Max - would this have strengthened the story knowing what world we lived in? The understanding that this was a low-budget film was rooted in my mind the techniques provided were impressive but should that have been neglected for mediocre storytelling? Perhaps I misread this film perhaps I missed the joy of why this is hailed as such a cult success.Another weakness against 'Mad Max' has to be the relationship between his wife/girlfriend and child. Again the lacking story helped confuse this viewer as to what dynamic they had but when we have scenes in which the child is completely forgotten about - it just decimates the reasons behind Max's anger and utter breakdown. There were several scenes in which I yelled at the screen 'What about the child' then finally they would remember - he seemed to fade in and out of existence too often for one film. Then when disaster strikes we are forced to believe that suddenly Gibson would release his inner rage? It just didn't work. The same can be said for his wife/girlfriend. A stronger definition of character and even more lines spoken would have helped me see the relationship. She seemed angry at first the product of a failed marriage forced by this post-apocalyptic world to stay together then we were introduced to love then suddenly she moved to idiocrity. Who would believe that running down a road when there are open fields around is the better option? It was these small inconsistencies that forced 'Mad Max' from greatness to just another average action film. Two-plus hour sweeping epics aren't always needed but stronger characters do help in creating the world that we as viewers are to inhabit for 90-ish minutes.Finally applause are in order for the villain in this film. The portrayal of Toecutter by Hugh Keays-Byrne was outstanding. The small attention to detail as well as his ability to make you feel like he would do anything to get his way - similar to the portrayal of Joker in 'The Dark Knight' - was an up moment for this film. Like a roller coaster 'Mad Max' had these ups and downs curves and jerks and when it was all said and done you really had to question whether you were going to ride it again. 'Mad Max' is an important film there is no question in my mind about that. The door that this film opened for future cinema in America couldn't have been done by a better group of filmmakers but it isn't a promising classic. I could not watch this film again. The sequels I am ready for but this ride is over - and the park is closing. I realize that I am in the minority but 'Mad Max' is a low-budget film that uses repetitive filmmaking as its staple - originality is present but you must search to find it.Grade",3.0

If one were to look at the attitudes of American colonists during the Revolutionary war by region one would find great disparities of opinion and support for the independence cause. Some areas of the colonies were strongly loyalist. Did this make the independence movement less valid? Another example; take two cities in Texas Austin and Fort Worth. Survey the populations of these areas about their opinions of President Bush. You would find greatly divergent aggregate views. My point is that this type of regional analysis is of limited use if you are trying to generalize over a population larger than the one investigated.It was no different in Vietnam. There were areas where the locals strongly supported the insurgency such as in the Iron Triangle which included Hau Nghia I believe. It is no surprise that the author found support for the insurgency here. On the other hand there were many places were the population strongly opposed the insurgency and even fled their arrival. Finally let us not forget that during the Tet offensive there was no general uprising against the South Vietnamese government as the communists fully expected there would be. Quite to the contrary in fact. The ARVN fought valiantly and the general population tried to stay out of the way and let the military restore order. Much as the general population does in all conflicts.This sort of parochial view of situations can have devastating effects on Policy just as it did with the over throw of Ngo Dinh Diem. The Saigon elites wanted Diem gone. But the Saigon elites had no more in common with the populace at large in Vietnam as Wall Street Financiers have with Iowa wheat farmers. Again the ideas of a small sampling were generalized over a large population and policy was formulated based on this. Another example of this concept can be found in one of the oft criticisms of Diem. Diem was often faulted for being a catholic in a predominantly Buddhist country. Calling Vietnam a Buddhist country is like calling the USA a Christian country. Probably most Americans call themselves Christian but what does this mean? It means many things and encompasses many ideas. Ideas that are often at odds with each other. The same was true in Vietnam at the time. This kind of historic generalization is of limited usefulness to understanding the larger context. The Author should have refrained from extending his conclusions to the larger whole based on an otherwise interesting investigation.As for those who served in Vietnam and had their opinions validated by this text. Again this is a question of generalizing over the whole one's own personal experiences. We all like to think of ourselves as representative of everyone else but this is not necessarily true either. I have the utmost respect for those who served in Vietnam. They did their duty during a difficult period in our history. However most American service personnel did not speak the language were isolated from the local population and only received a limited understanding of the situation in Vietnam. How can one truly fromulate a concrete understanding of something in such circumstances? Also is the perspective of the grunt humping the boonies going to be the same as a Saigon warrior? Clearly not. Many soldiers came away from Vietnam with opinions about the local population that were shaped by an extremely limited exposure to them in a myriad of different contexts. One does not have to look far however to find countless books by soldiers and civilians who worked closely with the Vietnamese and local populations and came to completely different conclusions. Most of the books written by those who understood the language or dealt with the Vietnamese regularly show a strong belief in the cause of aiding the Vietnamese. Those who got to truly know the Vietnamese most frequently came away with a very positive feeling toward them believed they were worthy of the efforts being expended by the USA and were sincere in their desire to be free of communist domination.It has been my intention here to point out the limitations of interpreting broad historical events by looking at microcosms in history. Having established this I do believe that this book is a worthwhile read. It is an interesting regional investigation of a complex environment. I would just admonish people to approach it with an appreciation of its limitations and seek other sources to contrast this book with for a broader understanding of the war in general. ",3.0
" HP has made a solid printer for light home use in the 825c.HP based this bargain printer on the bones of the sturdy albeit older 800 series. This is a real advantage because you take advantage of HP's paid-for tooling on a formerly higher-priced series. You get a printer that's more solidly built than comparable entry-level printers but the tradeoff is that you don't get the latest printing technology advances. This printer is best for printing text and light graphics. It prints photos as well although probably not as well as a printer with the latest technologies.The 825c is easy to install -- I had it running in minutes on my decrepit 1997-vintage Windows 98 PC.

" Streisand's lastest CD *Guilty Pleasures* was a feast of songs she had never sung before and a reunion with Barry Gibb who writes for Barbra in a more contemporary way than the Bergmans or Marvin Hamlisch. It is a great CD and her voice is sublime aided of course by sound technicians. All artists owe their sound engineers their careers though. She and Barry have fun on it--it's fresh and alive. Not so much with the 2006 Concert CD a recording of the concert tour replete with IL Divo a mostly unnecessary addition. They are wooden men with BIG BORING voices.From the beginning Babs sounds tired hoarse and raspy. I saw her in concert where she sometimes sounded even worse than this recording. The engineers cleaned it up as well as they could leaving more than a hint of breathiness and weariness. Fortunately only about half of the songs are weakly rendered; the other half really are terrific experiences. I have no idea what is going on with her voice that from song to song there could be such differences but if I were Streisand I would leave the belting behind. It wouldn't hurt for her to warm up before she comes onstage not as she is giving the concert. For any price a fan would expect the performer to be well prepared. When she sings a soft ballad she often soars and her magic is prominent. It's painful to watch her crumble under the memory of her once youthful voice (and it was only a few years ago that she sounded like a 25 year old songstress). Streisand knows how to play a song for all its worth but she sometimes tramples it to death. *Don't Rain in My Parade* is just not what it used to be. She hits high notes but without the characteristic force. And she can hold the notes or seem to when she takes little breaks before each song's finale. Her phrasing is impeccable when she is giving it all she has to give but too often she seems bored. This is not a bad CD just not as inspired as *The Concert.*It also has to be said that it seems apparent Streisand is not taking care of her God-given voice one she herself has said that she takes for granted (unimaginable!!).The chatter inbetween songs is dull and preachy and it was exactly the same in every city except for blabbering about the fattening food she ate all across the US (excluded from the CD thank the Lord). The fans are really the stars on this CD--they roar constantly as if they had been starving to see Streisand all their lives. It's an odd treat. The orchestra is incredible but live it drowns her out at times (as does IL Divo). This recording does not relfect that though.If you do not own *The Concert* CD buy it and skip this one. This CD is for avid adoration-is-blind Streisand fans only and those keeping track of Streisand's vocal history.. ",3.0
" Big fan here always have been. Saw her in 1994 and 2000 and loved her voice and her song selection. Saw her in 2006 and left disappointed. I am not going to address the voice - let's face it - anyone expecting to hear Streisand in her prime is going to be disappointed. I want to address her song selection. How BORING! Like Garland's Over The Rainbow attendees cannot expect her not to sing the BIG ONES - Evergreen The Way We Were People and Happy Days Are Here Again - those are a given. But what about the rest?? Except for a few treasures (Cockeyed Optimist Unusual Way) the rest is a snooze fest. We already have live versions of Come Rain Or Come Shine (Australian Tour bonus CD from Barnes & Noble) Starting Here Starting Now Down With Love Children Will Listen What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life Somewhere. Where are the songs we haven't heard live before?? Perhaps something from Guilty Pleasures or Guilty? Anything from Yentl besides A Piece of Sky? If I Loved You? Perhaps songs she hasn't sung before from Broadway? Another Winter In A Summer Town or Will You from Grey Gardens? ANYTHING that wasn't written during the Ice Age would've sent the crowd and listener crazy. This is just more of the same just not sung quite as well as in the past. ",3.0
" I saw Streisand in concert this past October at Madison Square Garden in NYC. I have been a Streisand fan for many years and was hugely excited to actually be able to hear and see her sing live. By that point the reviews of her tour were glowing and I was looking so forward this very rare experience. I have to admit when I saw the show I felt a mixture of emotion but the most prominent was the feeling of being underwhelmed. Her voice was raspy and croaky and felt heavy in it's attempts to soar. I think her phrasing and breathe control is outstanding but the hoarseness makes this vocal instrument now far from pure. I hoped that this was simply a one night thing - she was having an off-night so much singing perhaps had strained her voice .However this record goes to show that Streisand's once incredible range power and vocal gymnastics are now on their way out. Of course she sounds good for 65 but this record in my mind should have never been released. It's hard to listen and not be disapointed. It's time that she put aside her arrogance and worked on her voice - she needs singing lessons she needs to change her diet she needs to have the voice that people want to hear not the lazy take it as you find it version. Barbra - call Celine she will give you tips on preservation! ",3.0

" For those who attended the concerts and were waiting to have a CD copy to 'feel the sense of being at her concert again' the CD is disappointed.This kind of live album is supposed to bring back the concert as it was with the highs and the lows. Even though Barbra was still great at the concert you could feel how her voice range has changed with age. (I am a lifelong fan of her musical career but not a worshiper) This album was so edited that it looks more like a enhance-in-studio product with a lot of cuts (sometimes they even abruptly cut her words...) than a concert. The sense of listening to a concert album is lost.This could be more appropiately named 'Highlights from the 2006 Tour concerts' since the production team seems like have picked the best performance of each song among the 16 dates and glue them in together.The decision to add different 'bonus' tracks for different outlets shows some lack of respect to her fans.

" It's like Miss Kittin didn't know what to do with her debut solo album so she did it all. As a result it's a distracting and ultimately uninspired release. There's a rap track (Requiem For A Hit) and a Frecnh lounge number (3eme Sexe) and a rockin' punk ditty (Meet Sue Be She) and a drony dub bit (Dub About Me) and bunch of other forgettable tracks. For me Miss Kittin is at her best when she talk/sings in that oh-so-bored voice backed by a throbbing trance or house beat like Madame Hollywood with Felix da Housecat or Walk On By with The Hacker.

" No one can be miss kittin...And no better that her to be a featured artist...Miss Kittin & The Hacker....What a breathtaking electroclash couple...Miss kittin & felix da Housecat....Both made the best unforgiven era of contemprary glittery retro electro music with their 2001 'Kittinz & The Glitz'...Miss kittin & Golden Boy",3.0
" When I heard Miss Kittin was going to be launching her solo album without the production help of the Hacker or Golden Boy (with whom she's released one album each plus a few singles) I was skeptical to say the least. Considering the last time I heard a DJ set by her she spent a lot of the time vocalizing like a bad haunted house effects box or ghost cat I had little faith in how she would pull it together for a full length.The album is scattered with varied results. Some tracks are electroclash rockers like 'Meet Sue Be She' and 'Professional Distortion' although the lyrics are so awful that it really detracts from what is otherwise pretty decent music. It is refreshing that she isn't completely relying on her 'I'm bored I'm bored' schtick that brought her attention originally with tracks on which she sings quite well as well as more aggressive vocals (a la T.Raumschmiere's 'The Game Is Not Over').All this considered I suppose it's no great surprise that the best songs are produced by the Hacker and Smash TV. 'Soundtrack of Now' is light on the vocals and heavy on the stiff 4 to the floor sound that characterized the duo's album on Gigolo. 'Dub About Me' is a dub reworking of Smash TV's 'What About Me' (from their outstanding 2002 album 'Electrified' on BPitch Control) with floating vocals by Miss Kittin as well as the original vocoded vocals from Smash TV.While the album is a bit uneven honestly it's better than I had expected. Miss Kittin is more of an artist than her image tends to let on and she has proven capable of assembling a reasonable set of tracks. The genre-hopping doesn't always work but it's never dull. ",3.0
" ok so i finally got this cd the other day i've been waiting to buy it for months. well it's not so great. i mean it's not bad just nothing as jaw-dropping good as any of her collabos. the first single 'professional distortion' sounds like it was written to be a single but its pretty ok. it sounds a little matmos/aphex twin-ish the lyrics are a little silly (the lyrics only get worse the further the album goes making you almost wish that miss kittin would just sing/speak her vocals in french check out the 'rocker' meet sue be she the lyrics are cringe-inducingly bad.)another song (beat for a hit) could be good with the strange pairing of the kittin and some m.c. kind of going for a bit of slowed down ghetto tech. the song gets longish and very repetitive though. yea... the only song on the album that the hacker does the music for (soundtrack of now) is also almost all instrumental which is sad cuz its the best music on the album. so i'm sad because i really wish she would've just done another album with the hacker. he really seemed to know how to utilize her talents. this album is meandering and at times just kinda boring. it gets 3 stars cuz its still better than most crap that gets put out.

" 1.Professional Distortion - This is a great song it's wicked and would fit perfectly into the cd players of the guys with massive speakers in their cars. It's loud funky and the beat is one of the best i've ever heard. Cooly funny lyrics too. THey don't make sense. Gets boring quickly. 9/102.Requiem for a Hit - This song is sooo good! At first i hated it but it really grew on me with its incredibly simple beat and that synth that just pumps all the way through. It gets even better when Miss Kittin starts singing too. 7.5/103.Meet Sue Be She - Kind of annoying an obvious filler track. Miss kittin's voice makes me laugh again and the lyrics are woeful. But its a good song to jump around to. Pretty catchy though. 7/104.Happy Violentine - A bit of a long track but well worth the time for the experience. When i first heard it i was taken aback by Miss Kittin's songwriting talent almost flabbergasted. It gets even better when all the synths pianos and singing all manage to wind together nicely in the end. 9/105.Allergic - This song is cute and fun it's quite wierd it's very quiet and trance-like but still has a fast beat. It's unusual to the ears but its still an above average listen. 8/106.Kiss Factory - Easily the worst track on the album another filler. It doesnt make sense and its very annoying and generic. I guess one could call it catchy but i could never stand it even with 5+ listens. Turn it off please. 4/107.Clone Me - The best track on the album. It's got an awesome synth paced throughout the entire song like Requiem for a hit and is very danceable. Catchy beat and tune i love it. The lyrics like the lyrics in most of the album are nonsensical but you forget about them quickly. Great chorus - 'Hello Kittin you came to play Hello Kittin you look strange today...' 9.5/108.I Come.com - Lyrics are utter nonsense. The whispering at the beginning is kind of annoying but once the rhythmic singing comes in halfway through it gets very very good. And the way she distorts her voice is great too. 8.5/109.Soundtrack of Now - The only song on the album featuring The Hacker and thank god. This song is so annoying and is incredibly uncreative. It's a bit of a joke on this album and its about time Kittin dropped The Hacker once and for all. Worse song on the album. 2.5/1010.Neukolin - This is really just an experiment in music. It makes no sense and the only lyrics are a few words in german. It's very synthy and not pleasant to listen to. It's an experience. 6.5/1011.Dub About Me - Another slow long song but not as good as Happy Violentine. It's still very good and makes you think. It could do without the heavy jarring synth that comes through every now and then. 7.5/1012.3eme Sexe - BEST SONG EVER! This song sums up the album perfectly. It's a beautiful french ballad with a hint of electronica. If there's one song you need to listen to it's this one. Beautiful chorus beautiful music. Leaves you with good impressions of the album. A perfect 10/10. ",3.0

" I read about this book in a New Republic article about Lopez Obrador the leftist who recently lost in Mexico's presidential election. Obrador is from the southern state of Tabasco an isolated southern state that Greene visits in this book. Greene's interest in the state stems from the fact that in the 1930's the region's governor spearheaded one of the most virulent anti-religious campaigns in all of Mexico. Greene was commissioned to write about how Mexicans were coping during this period of intense suppression of religious expression. My interest in the book was purely historical and sociological; I wanted to better understand the ideology that led the state to clamp down on religious institutions and how ordinary Mexicans reacted to this. In that sense the book did not quite live up to my expectations. Instead in spite of the beautiful prose (which ensures a pretty quick read) and occasional sparks of wisdom the book read like a bitter disgruntled travelogue.For starters as Greene himself concedes his Spanish was apparently not so good at the time something that obviously limited his ability to talk with ordinary Mexicans who knew no English (this is not to mention that many of the Indians in Tabasco and Chiapas did not even speak Spanish). Tabasco and Chiapas are both built up at as hearts of darkness; he announces at the beginning of the book his intention to visit these remote places but he does not even reach Tabasco until halfway through the book as the first part consists of his journey from Texas down to Mexico City. And then when he finally does reach these places the effect is rather anti-climactic as he doesn't even seem to talk to any ordinary Mexicans about the religious situation. Obviously this probably had a lot to do with people's unwillingness to talk about such a politically sensitive issue but it was still disappointing that he went to so much effort to reach such remote places only to come away with so few real insights. In Tabasco and Chiapas the only people Greene seems to befriend are odball expatriate Europeans and Americans. These were fascinating characters and the stories of how they ended up in the backwaters of southern Mexico are worthy stories on their own but I think we would be critical of any contemporary journalist who only fraternizes with expats.Perhaps the most disturbing thing though is something that Sirin alludes to in his review (but surprisingly none of the other reviewers have mentioned) namely Greene's explicit hatred for the country and its people which was quite unexpected. As I was reading it I kept reminding myself of the context since the book was written in the 1930's from an obviously colonial mindset. However by the end of the book when Greene is tired ill and ready to return home the bitterness towards Mexico becomes hard to ignore. Virtually every behavioral trait he observes in Mexicans obviously hides sinister intentions. He has something bad to say about every place his train passes through. Again I realize that the author was fatigued from his travels and ill at this point but it still didn't make for particularly fun reading.I gave the book three stars because it does have many merits. As I mentioned Greene writes beautifully (I have read and loved the 'The Comedians' and plan to read some of his other novels in the near future). Also the simple fact that he visited some of these remote places during this interesting period of Mexico's history makes the book intrinsically interesting. Overall however the book just wasn't quite what I expected. ",3.0
" I was thrilled to hear about this book from a friend who suggested she was going to adopt for Advent a theme of thanksgiving and praise to God especially for the negative circumstances in her life. I felt this was an answer to a prayer since I'd been hoping to find some nice Christian fiction reading. So I found the book on amazon.com and bought it right away just in time for the start of Advent. The book initially seemed very good to promote these ideas. However since I have an M.A. in Theology from a Dominican school I had to try hard to overlook her harsh misrepresentation of Thomas Aquinas beginning on pg. 161. I set the book aside for a few hours and was able to return to it because I really enjoyed the earlier parts of the book. Then the author began again on pg. 173 and I just couldn't continue reading with her untruths. I had to wonder why she was so adamant about proving a wrong point and whether the other parts of her book were as unfounded as this.To expound - To classify Thomas Aquinas with the likes of Kant Calvin Rousseau - is utterly ridiculous to anyone who has any familiarity with the discipline of philosophy. If her statement is that they are philosophers and think (use their minds) and hence brought on the Age of Reason well this is superficially true. Does she regret the Age of Reason?If her statement is that reason when used to the exclusion of emotions is unbalanced her statement is true. However she is unaware of Aquinas's lengthy treatment of the emotions and their itegration in what he calls the 'intellect.' His definition of the intellect differs substantially from what we call the 'intellect' in our post-modern culture. The 'intellect' is much more expansive in his definition and does not act in exclusion to the emotions.In fact when I began to read his analysis of the emotions it was the healthiest description I'd encountered anywhere. He believes the emotions are all good all very natural. The emotions are our very personal and individual response to the environment to external stimuli and they simple are what they are. It is our response to the emotion and our consequent actions which are considered 'good' or 'bad.' We engage our intellect to decide what is good to do in each situation. The emotions themselves are completely integral to our healthy lives and cannot be judged.I am disappointed in yet another 'protestant' work which is misinformed about the very foundations of Christianity and chooses to bury an attack so deeply in its text. I was hoping for an uplifting and encouraging book to read.I will use this opportunity to suggest to ministers that the material you receive in your seminaries regarding the Catholic faith is incomplete and misinformed. Having spoken to numerous pastors about their scathing critiques of Catholicism they have admitted that their beliefs are based on their learnings at seminary. I have informed them they are factually mistaken in their teachings and to research for themselves. I will grant to author Catherine Marshall that Thomas Aquinas' seminal work 'Summa Theologica' is a very difficult read. Perhaps she relied on hearsay to form her opinions. I would encourage you to read and determine for yourself so you are not proven fallacious in your beliefs. You might enjoy it; I found it quite beautiful. ",3.0

Almost 50 years since his death James Dean still has a substantial influence on contemporary culture. The book covers the principal facts and chronology of James Dean's short life. There is no whitewashing of gay issues no unsubstantiated unsavory speculations and no new material. As such it is a useful and inexpensive book for someone who wants 'Just give me the facts m'am'. It is a useful introduction to the life of James Dean if this is the first biography that you are reading. True die-hard fans will want more. ",3.0
" As the title indicates this book is about crucial confrontations. It starts off by defining what a crucial confrontation is and why we should care to have it. Then discusses how to know what crucial confrontation to hold and if one should hold it. After that comes what to do during a crucial confrontation and last but not least what to do after it. I believe that Crucial Confrontations are a crucial tool/mechanism that any successful leader should have in his arsenal. If used effectively it helps promote a culture of accountability which usually entails high performance and high engagement. This book explains in depth the process from start to finish both within a personal and work setting. The reason I gave this book a lower rating despite the very valuable content is that I felt that the material could have been more condensed and presented in a shorter more story-like format. I would recommend skimming through this book but definitely focus on the summaries of each of the chapters/stages of a confrontation. ",3.0
" This book is good on structure and well organized for retention with some very good points and very approachable examples and analogies. It is not a must read for everyone and the insights provided are fairly straightforward.

" I found the book very limited because of the kinds of confrontations presented. For the narrow focus the information was good although not as concise as I would have liked. There are so many other confrontations which were not addressed. How does one answer an employee who always wants a bigger raise or more time off? How does one handle an employee who is never satisfied with the work environment?

I recommend you to buy it but if you are really looking for the more live (Janet wasn't signing live Madonna did) energetic sexier version of this tour then I'd rather you get the Girlie Show tour by the real queen of pop Madonna (it was the best moments of my life to be there watching it live in front of me).

" I think if Joan Crawford had not been cast in this film it would not be given much importance because it is not that good a film but she manages to give one of her most sympathetic performances one for which she was nominated for an Academy Award although she should have recieved this honor for some of her other work like JOHNNY GUITAR or WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE?. Almost singlehandly she manages to provide the movie with many moments of unbearable suspense though the directon is not too shabby. The director David Miller uses light and shadows to provide a good tension filled atmosphere and Gloria Grahamein a performance for which she was nomintated as best supporting actress also supplies great support and she is defintley a highlight. Jack Palance is very menacing in this movie and he also manages to do a good job. The script is not that original though and ultimatly the script is the problem with the movie. And before i forget the story is about a playwright named Myra Hudson(Joan Crawford) who marries the actor she fired from her play(Jack Palance). She then discovers a plot that has been concocted between her husband and his lover( Gloria Grahame) to kill her for her money. Then she comes up with a plot to kill them instead.

" NOMADS OF SOUTH PERSIA was written in the 1950s when the (nearly always male) researchers tried to conform to a perceived scientific norm. At the time Barth wrote a book for specialists not for general readers and his work has become a minor classic in the field. However anthropology has gone through many a twist and turn since then. It is doubtful if many anthropologists want to read the same book today. I recently did. I have no idea whether nomadic life continues in Iran today or if it does--- (the New York Times recently reported a 'nomad conference' that took place in Ethiopia with some Iranian participation)---if it resembles the description in this book. We might call Barth's work 'social history' now. It is a book that gives no quarter to non-specialists. If you can't use industrial-strength kinship terminology you will have a hard time following several chapters. However there are a number of interesting matters for example the nomads' animals thrive best if kept to a nomadic life. Staying all year at one place increased mortality dramatically. More centrally nomad women had a stronger role to play than those in villages because their cooperation was an economic necessity. Decision making at the lowest level of nomadic society (chiefly about moving or not moving camp) was complex and subtle due to the relative independence of everyone and complex family relations. The connection of the Basseri nomads with other nomads and with the larger sedentary society was equally interesting. The tendency of richer nomads was to invest surplus money in land; the tendency of poorer nomads to leave the nomadic life and settle down as landless labor in villages. Barth contrasts nomad and sedentary not as separate ethnic groups so much but as different life patterns extant in the same country. A vast social gulf existed between powerful village landowners and the subject landless laborers but among nomads though all were subject to the chief each household maintained considerable freedom and as long as they had enough animals economic independence.Barth concentrated on describing economic social and political organization. There is virtually nothing else in the 153 pages. You can admire this focussed approach so typical of the time or you can regret the lack of a more humanistic style which would have allowed the nomads some voice given a reader more sense of people and place examined symbol and ritual to a far greater extent or provided some clue as to Barth's own role among the Basseri. Alas self-revelation was not often thought of in that era we can hardly blame him. What startled me was the information that the author spent only three months with the Basseri. I finished the book wondering how accurate his description was and how much reflected a fine theoretical mind with an innovative cast. Barth did seem to be properly cautious about what informants said but with three months he would not have had enough time to observe actual life. Thus if the author had stayed longer with the Basseri a different book might have been written. Like Margaret Mead Barth seems to have made the most out of a short period of field work. I can only admire him for that but questions do remain. ",3.0

Due to the lack of publicity marketing and it's limited release this feature did not do well at the box office out here. It is a great pity as this is one of Van Damme's better offerings. Fans that wants to see their hero doing his famous splits and martial arts moves will be disappointed but if you are wanting a good old-fashioned action adventure without any elaborate special effects which seems to have taken over movie making these days Legionnaire fits the bill.

" I think the television listing description I read on this movie was misleading - actually no it was wrong. According to what my TiVo said the story followed a 1920s playboy who returns from a stint in the Foreign Legion to reclaim his former lover (a mobster's girl). Obviously the person who wrote this has never seen this movie. For starters he wasn't so much a playboy as he was a boxer and for second he never returns to France to reclaim his former lover. In fact we learn through the progress of the film that the woman in question has emigrated to the United States.Okay enough gripes about how inaccurate tv listings can be - what did I think about the movie in question. It's actually okay as far as Jean Claude VanDamme movies go except he really doesn't do much in the way of martial arts as he has in previous films. Instead he relies more on a rifle to shoot charging North African tribesmen or fists to straighten out fellow Foreign Legionnaire's who get their kicks out of bullying their weaker colleagues.Jean Claude plays a boxer who after reneging on a promise to throw a fight escapes into the French Foreign Legion to flee the clutches of a murderous mobster. There he is flung headfirst into the North Africa war between the local nomadic tribesmen and the occupying French forces.What was really a treat was the presence of Steven Berkoff. It's been awhile since I have seen him in a movie. He was a very high profile in the early to mid 1980s in movies such as `Beverly Hills Cop' `Octopussy' and `Rambo",3.0
" Here in Japan this film was given a limited theatrical release. in 2001. Before I see this movie I knew this film went straight to video in USso I didn't expect much fun from it. Frankly the plot is a dull one; the situation is borrowed from the typical 'leginnaire' films like Beau Geste and there is nothing new nor original here. Well and for fans of the previous films of the star it must be disappointing because there is no bone- crunching action scenes. Still it has good authentic location and superb supporting cast including Steven Berkoff and Nicholas Farrell. My favorite actor Steven Berkoff displays his over-the-top acting (though a bit overacting you may think) and I find it very delightful and Nicholas Farrell's subtle performance is giving some reason for not avoiding the video. Not a classic but good one of the genre. ",3.0

After having this a year the plastic never seems to look or smell right no matter how hard I clean it. I stopped making soups and steaming and decided to just stick to rice because of the 'smell' factor to the plastic. My teflon pan is discolored too - although I'm very careful to only use plastic with it and gentle cleansers. I hesitate between a 2 or 3 star review because...the Sanyo is cute  it has cooked rice predictably and for the first couple months I really liked it.

Also it seemed prone to leaks at first (wasn't sealing properly? the rubber needed to break in I guess)... time will tell whether it is as durable as the other brands. Another important point is that it took several cleaning/boiling sessions for us to get rid of the chlorine smell of the (supp. PVC) white plastic steaming basket. I like its simplicity though. ",3.0
" I purchased this rice cooker to replace my 30 year old (yes 30) National unit. It cooks rice well enough no better or worse than my older one but at least it has the warming feature that my older one did not have. It also works very well as a steamer. However there are two problems with this unit that are somewhat annoying. First there is no 'on/off' switch so if it is plugged in the warming function is on so you cannot just leave it sitting on the counter top plugged in. The second issue is that in my case water collects between the inner and outer walls of the unit (I am guessing that the 'dew collector' on the back is overflowing) requiring that I invert the unit and shake the water out.Overall it is not a bad unit but in my opinion Sanyo cut a few corners in an effort to keep the price down and it results in a less than ideal appliance ",3.0

" For some reason I always manage to botch rice the old fashioned way. Not enough water too much water too much heat. It never turns out right which is why I bought a rice maker. I also love steel cut oats which the reviews said this machine also cooked with ease. I used it a lot when I first bought it and it cooked everything very well. However I don't know if something on the machine broke or if I'm now doing something wrong but every time I try to cook my steel cut oats the lid opens up on its own and a gooey starchy mess of boil-over spills down the sides and onto my counter. When the lid opens up it also allows the water to evaporate and doesn't cook the oats properly (sometimes they're still a little crunchy). Also when there's a boil over mess it takes a lot of effort to clean all of the nooks and crannies on this machine. At first I didn't notice that there's some kind of plastic container thing on the back...and I didn't notice it until it started smelling of rotten something-or-other because dirty rice/oat water had been fermenting in it for several weeks. On cleaning the insert is really easy to wash even if you let it sit after cooking because it's nonstick. The rest of the machine including the lid and the lid gasket is a huge pain to clean if you don't wipe it down while it's still warm...and I'm notoriously bad about doing that. For this reason the rice maker has been stuck in a closet for several months now. Perhaps I'll dig it out again and give it another go because it really does a lovely job making rice...but since rice is only half the reason I bought it (oats being the other) for now it's way more of a pain to use than it's worth.

" I bought this rice cooker several months ago after researching all the options. In general I've been quite pleased with it. It makes tasty rice; the metal insert is easy to clean and the closed design prevents it from making that annoying clanking noise that occurs with cheaper rice cookers (i.e. the sound of the lid bouncing around as air escapes). For better or worse however it takes forever to actually make rice. A single 1 cup batch of rice can take 30+ minutes to cook. This means that I have started a 'quick' stir-fry on several occasions only to realize that my rice wouldn't be done for at least 10 minutes after the other food was on the table. Usually this can be circumvented by starting the rice before all the other food but I still find it somewhat inconvenient. One should also be aware of the tiny plastic drainage cup in the back of the machine. It does accumulate water from the cooking process so it should be cleaned regularly. Otherwise it gets gross. Overall I find this to be a very nice rice cooker. It does make good rice. It is not fast though so if you're looking for a quick machine this is not your best option. ",3.0
" A friend of mine spent a summer in Japan and came back with a Minidisc recorder and several compilations of crazy Japanese music. He'd lost all the artists names but one track named 'Doubt' caught my attention.Well two weeks ago I bought this on a whim because the cover looked neat. Once in my hands it looked even better but while I listened to the first track and scanned over the track list I noticed a song called 'Doubt' and then quickly associated the vocals I was hearing with the long-lost song. I quickly jumped to 'Doubt' and was treated to an alternate recording that I wasn't familiar with though it was clear that it was the same song. After a few moments of searching the internet I'm introduced to Hide. (the version I knew is usually labeled 'Doubt '97' or 'Doubt (Mixed LEMONed Jelly Mix').For a westerner Hide's solo work is pretty spotty. Three albums and a smattering of singles across the mid-90s much of it sounding like high-speed pop music with soaring solos and dripping with cheese. As far as I can tell Hide is to hair metal what hair metal is to heavy rock bands. After an evening sampling Hide's solo project it became pretty clear why his music needed to be 'altered' if he wanted any kind of success in the west. I'm not sure if jumping on the over-engineered industrial metal train was the best approach.While technically competent none of the tracks really stick with me (aside from 'Doubt' for obvious reasons). 'Fuctrack#6' is an embarrassing introduction to the tail end of the disc. By the time it comes on you'll be thirty minutes deep and you might as well stick around for what follows -- some of Hide's heavier tracks borrowed and re-recorded.Make no mistake this is Hide's attempt to bring his music to the west. Ray McVeigh and Paul Raven are here as well as a closet full of friends but nobody really takes the stage away from Hide. Don't buy this for the guest appearances list you'll be sorely disappointed -- for example Jaz Coleman shouts for less than a minute opposite some broad who wants to 'f you up the a until you bleed'. Hmm. And what exactly Geordie and Chris Vrenna contributed to all this I haven't been compelled enough to open up the booklet and figure out just yet.Unfortunately Hide passed away before this album was released. In America only a handful of fans of X Japan and whoever picked up the Heavy Metal 2000 soundtrack ever noticed. Don't let that stop you from checking it out if you're fascinated with this era or this sound but don't expect a lost gem. ",3.0
" Part of hide's charm was his free-wheeling venture into all different styles of rock music. Here the american producers of the album seem to have targeted it to a particular industrial-explicit niche losing a lot of the lightness humor and experimentation found in hide's other albums.

The musicians are excellent and the mix great but I don't find any of the songs particularly memorable. ",3.0

(Or maybe he got better as he went along.)Anyway I found the Catholic apologetics most fascinating. Much of it I knew and agreed with but I had never understood why Catholics consider Peter to be the first Pope. (Shows how ignorant we non-Catholics are even those of us sympathetic to Catholic beliefs!) ",3.0
" The book was interesting if you do not know anything about Catholic apologetics. You can learn alot about the faith from this book. It is a good examlpe of what Fundamentalists believ and of how apologists defend the faith. There were some unrealistic things about thbook such as that Mike went from not knowing a lot to knowing evrything and defending his faith in about 4 weeks. Overall it was a good book and i suggest that you read it if you want to know more about or are interested in becoming an apologist. ",3.0
" A Philadelphia Catholic in King James Court was an ok book. Michael O'shea and his family move to Kentucky to live with his uncle after his father dies. Michael learns a lot more about his religion than he already knew and he also learned a little bit about his uncle's religion. Michael is forced to defend his faith to his uncle's church members and elders. This book is mainly about the arguing of Catholics and fundamentalists. Catholics believe that the bible is from tradition and fundamentalists believe that the bible is the final say in what they do. I also thought that the book was really unrealistic. What kind of teenager would spend a whole summer studying his catholic faith? I know the way that I am going to do work in the summer is if I am in summer school or I have to do work for the future school year. I also would not expect a 14 year old kid to be reciting bible passages in the middle of his sentences to back up his thoughts. I think this book should receive 3 out of 5 stars because I couldn't really get into the story at all. I guess the apologetics novel is not my type of book. ",3.0
" 'A Phildelphia Catholic in Kings James's Court' tells the story of a Catholic teenager who finds himself living among strict 'scripture only' Fundamentalists. This book is packed with Catholic response to Fundamentalist ideas. It is easy to read and insightful all at the same time. Anyone who wants to learn more about Catholic vs. Fundatmentalist beliefs should start here. ",3.0
" This novel is about a boy named Michael who clashes with Fundamentalist Christians over matters about the papacy Mary and the Eucharist while trying to understand his own faith better. I think the novel did a good job in explaining why Catholics believe what they do. I learned some things about why Catholics have the beliefs they do. One problem I found with the book was that the beginning was very dull and boring and did not draw my attention. It started to become a little more interesting with the Bible discussions but it was still boring overall. I found it hard to relate to them living on a farm. Overall I think it is a gook book to read if you want to find more about the Catholic faith but not if you want a book that you cannot put down. ",3.0
" I felt A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a pretty good book but it lacked an entertaining plot and some aspects of the book were unusual.

Although it explained most of the aspects of the Catholic faith in depth the presentation of these ideas was in a boring manner. It was just plain talk and no excitement. Also there we some things in the book I could not believe were true. I thought about how Michael's whole summer revolved around the Bible and work. There was no play fun or friends just dedication to the Bible. I found that hard to believe because many teens want to have fun along with having a faith. Michael just had a faith it seemed. Also I thought it was hard to believe how Michael started down in Kentucky not knowing alot about the Bible and by the end of three months he knew more than his uncle who had been studying the Bible for years. Although it had these minor technicalities I thought the book was very informative and helped me understand my faith a little better. ",3.0

I think many parts of this book were greatly exaggerated. I also looked at the book in other ways too. I understood my religion more and now I have a clear understanding of the difference between Biblical Fundamentalists and Catholics. I see the flaws in Fundamentalism and now I know good arguments to prove Fundamentalists wrong. ",3.0
" A Philadelphia Catholic In King James's Court was an exceptional book which consisted of Protestant and Catholic conflicts within the Bible. The quality of the book was compromised when the author's ideas and beliefs were introduced into the book. For example the author talks about how he likes the city and the country but hates the suburbs which I feel resents me and my lifestyle on page 20. The story was quite simple and a little uninteresting because the timing of the story was a little unrealistic and slow in the sense that the author tried to fit everything in during the one summer Mike was at the farm. Mike's character didn't fit any type of teenager that I know and I couldn't relate to the story through Mike in any other sense other than the Catholic sense. The story was full of religious concepts and conflicts but didn't have much relation to a teenager's problems my troubles and confusions. A Philadelphia Catholic In King James's Court was a complete story with a plot that could flare an interest in people who have encountered Apologetics in their life but did not flare my interests. I consider the story to be a good basis on Catholic beliefs and a good understanding of the conflicts between religions. This was a good book in the aspect of religion and a good book for the faithful Catholic or Protestant but not for many other types of people. ",3.0

" Although this book was not very exciting in my opinion it gave me some new insights on Fundamentalist and Catholic views of the Bible. There is some background information in the story about the Bible and its meaning. It explains passages from certain sections in the Bible and gives some understanding to the time when it was written. I also learned about Fundamentalists and their view of Biblical interpretation. If you decide to purchase this book I recommend that you pay close attention to how the Fundamentalists sometimes contradict themselves and also how Michael (the main character) approaches the scripture. This book is great if you are interested in learning about the Catholic or Protestant religions or want to know what certain sections of the Bible mean. ",3.0
" Yo The book A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a nice book I enjoyed readin it very much. The book had a deeper meaning then what was on the surface. The story is about a boy named Mike. Mike's dad dies in a fire in the beginning of the story because of this his mom and siblings move to Kentucky with his cousins. Mike very much likes Kentucky and the farm at which they are staying at yet his uncle Les pressures him very much to become part of the Fundelmentalist church. Mike wants to stay Catholic because that is what his laid father was. The book explains mikes problems exposure opinion and experiences. The book was very insightful to a catholic who was learning about his faith like I am. This is not only a good read it would be perfect for teens or adults. It presents the reasoning on both sides very effectively and realistically. Because the defenses are in the context of an interesting novel I found myself more able to follow the line of reasoning. thank u for ur time ",3.0
" This book really showed me that although Christians share the same basic beliefs the denominations are very different from each other. In this book Michael a teen from Philadelphia takes on his uncle's town of Bible-wielding maniacs in Kentucky. Michael all but shows up these maniacs by expressing his Catholic views through scripture. The part about this book that is confusing is the fact that Michael can defeat a group of men who have been studying the Bible their whole lives after reading just a few commentaries on the Bible.

" When I first was presented this book in class I figured it would be a corny 'love everyone' book (like the typical religion textbook). I was pleasantly surprised at its ability to keep me awake (most of the time); however it's only the first step towards apologetic novels that can be truly effective. The beginning portion is rather boring and full of unnecessary drivel. The portion in which he absorbs the Biblical knowledge later used in arguments seemed as if de Porres wrote that at the last minute for two reasons. Firstly he hardly refers to any of the information that Michael cites in his speeches despite saying in subtext that he did so. Secondly how could anyone absorb all that Biblical interpretation in such a short time let alone use it effectively? This stemmed out into other smaller contradictions which made it hard to read between the lines at times. Beyond that de Porres made readable what many could not",3.0
" A Philadelphia Catholic in King Jame's Court starts out a tragic turn of events. Michael and his family lose their father in a fire. His family is now going to move to they country and out of the city with his uncle and his family on their farm. The story really gets going as Michael adjusts to his new lifestyle. His uncle Les is a very religious man. Having once been a Catholic he converted to Fundamentalist because of differences in beliefs. Michael too started to question his religion. Yet he realized that Catholics had a different way of viewing the bible mass and Traditions. Michael spoke at Les's church in discussions explaining and proving Catholicism to the Fundamentalists. In this book you will see many controdictions and inconsistencies in Les's religion.This book is great for finding out for what you believe and what your religion means to you. It points out many problematic areas of the church and clears them out. Martin De Porres Kennedy wrote this book well and I think that it does its job; in explaining Catholicism. I never thought this book would be one that I'd enjoy but it turned out to be a very good read and an informational book. ",3.0
" A Philadelphia in King James Court is a good book to read to learn more about the catholic faith but if you were interested in reading a pleasure book you wouldn't be satisfied. Personally I didn't like the book it was a very well written and formatted book but it was also very boring. I like books with suspense and this was more of a strait forward book explaining the differences between the Catholic Church and the fundamentalist. The Catholic being Michael and his father who had died and the Fundamentalist being Les Michaels Uncle. Michael O'Shea is a 17 year old boy who is living a normal life when unexpectedly his father died in a fire. Michael had to move down south with his Uncle where he learns about their religions and about his own religion also. This is where we learn about the way of a fundamentalist compared to our Catholic religion. Even though I did not like the book I learned a lot about it in Mr. Puntel's class the book itself was very boring but when you take it into a classroom or a study you can learn a lot about your faith and about the faith of the people around you. ",3.0
" This book is good and bad in some parts. It makes sense what Michael is explaining but if you think about it it doesn't make any sense. Michael moved from Philadelphia to Georgia/Alabama/SOUTH because his dad died in a heroic effort to save someone. First of all why would he leave there and second why would he go to the south instead of with relatives or back to their house in Philly. The arguments Michael presents make sense and he destroys what the fundamentalists say so much that they throw him out of the south. How does Michael learn all of this does it pop in to his head one morning and he decides to start bashing on the people he is living with and go against his mothers brothers religion. If I was his mom I would slap him and leave the south because there is no reason for him to go against it. Michael meets Les who is the leader of the local church and he has a sermon about go-between people. He says they are wrong and then when the sermon is over he decides to question the person who he is living with on his morals and religion. Les cannot explain the final answer to his sermon because he doesn't know the answer to it. The same thing happens when they go to mass at a catholic church down south. The pastor gives a sermon and Michael has no clue what he is talking about so he asks the pastor what he meant and he failed to answer him also. Then Michael realizes somehow that the fundamentalists are wrong about everything so he starts arguing with local fundamentalist leaders. In the end Michael is kicked out of the south for arguing with the head fundamentalist guy and I guess he goes back to live inPhilly with his friends. This book is good on the issues but there are key things missing to the plot. ",3.0
" as i first started reading this book i couldent stand it. it was boring and pointless. i didnt know why i was reading it but after a few chapters it got better. i found out i was reading this book because it explains some things about the catholic church like why catholics have a pope and why catholics honor mary. this is a good book to read for anyone who is thiking of becoming a catholic or for catholics who do not agree with certain church teachings. eventually this book became a book i actually wanted to read instead of just reading it because it explained things about the cathoolic church. it had a good plot. i would give this book 3 stars because it was not too boring and it was very education.

This book is a great book to read if you are trying to find your faith as a Catholic. ",3.0
" This book was interesting. It was interesting to see how Michael defended his own Catholic faith against the fundamentalists. I have to be honest and say that if this book had been an optional reading assignment I would have opted not to. On the other hand I am glad in a way that it was not optional because at the end of the story I had learned some things and been given some new ideas that I had not had before. I read this book with more of an understanding of the protestant side being a Presbyterian (even though I have become familiar with the Catholic practice in Mr. Puntel's class at LaSalle College High School). Some of the things mentioned by Michael in this story were foreign at first but through class discussions I was able to get a better understand and learn some new things about the Catholic Faith that I had not yet picked up in my textbook. I would say that if you are looking for a thriller to read that this is not exactly the type of book you want to read but if you are looking to learn something new about both Catholic and Protestant Christianity this book would be an excellent start.

" I felt that 'A Philadelphia Catholic in King James' Court' was a well written book with a couple minor flaws. This book was about a young teenager named Michael who moved to Kentucky to live with his uncle for the summer. While there he learned many things. He learned that he didn't know everything about his own religion and he also studied a totally different religion. I felt that this book taught me many things. The book taught me about the beliefs of Fundamentalists. The book even taught me things I didn't know about my own religion. A Philadelphia Catholic depicts the differences between the two religions. The Fundamentalists believe that the Bible must be taken word for word; while the Catholics believe in the Bible they also base some of their religion on traditions. This book also had a couple flaws. I felt that the book was unrealistic. A teenager wouldn't spend his/her summer reading and studying about their religion as well as another religion. Another flaw was that even if a teenager studied about these religions he wouldn't become an expert so quickly. I found that rather than enjoying the book I learned from the book.. It seemed that the book was more like a text than it was a story. Overall the book was good but the flaws prevented me from giving the book five stars. ",3.0

" When our class was assigned this book to read like everyone else I thought it would be another boring book that we were being forced to read.

The main character is Michael O'shea. He is a 17 year old boy living a normal life in Philadelphia until his father dies in a fire. After his father's death he moves down south to live with his uncle Les who is a Fundamentalist. While Michael is living with his uncle he learns the differences between Catholics and Fundamentalists. For instance he learns why the Catholic Bibles have more books than the Fundamentalist Bibles and why Catholics have a Pope.This book would not be satisfying to a reader just reading a book for enjoyment.

" 'The Sinful Dwarf' is a Danish/American production which actually played in theaters in Denmark (I've talked people to who saw the 'shocking' premiere). The lead actor Torben Bille is one the most recognized dwarf actors in Denmark...I guess he would rather forget this ultra bizarre piece of sexploitation.Torben lures innocent young girls to his mom's house with help of mechanical toy poodles. They are drugged and tied up and later abused by 'clients' and/or sold into slavery. In between Dwarf and his drunk mom are doin' several musical numbers. The many sex scenes are pretty close to porn and the soundtrack reminded me of the Residents. It's like an insane mix between 'Bloodsucking Freaks' and 'Pink Flamingos' with zero comic relief - this movie will blow your mind.

" From grindhouse and sleaze-meister Harry Novak and out of the deepest recesses of the 70's came - 'Dvrgen' ('The Sinful Dwarf') AKA 'Das Haus der verlorenen Madchen' 1973 and directed by Vidal Raski. Three minutes into the film we knew this was going to be one sick ride! 'Olaf' (Torben Bille) had a penchant for young innocent girls (who were also naive enough to fall for the charms of a devilish looking dwarf with wind up toys!) as he lured them to follow him home to become unwitting sex slaves! Oh and his pleasant mother 'Lila' (Clara Keller) actually encouraged this behaviour since it brought in additional income. When a young unsuspecting couple 'Mary' and 'Peter' (Anne Sparrow and Tony Eades) suddenly showed up looking for a room to let Olaf obligingly agreed (when a dwarf jumps on the bed in the room you're looking to rent and says in a Danish accent..'you see...it is a nice soft bed' and lets off a sinister cackle. Maybe it's not a good idea and politely you would say thanks but no thanks!!) and took them upstairs. Did I mention that mother 'Lila' (not to be confused with 'Lola') appeared to be a washed-up cabaret performer (she definitely did not play the 'Blue Angel') and had an inclination to dress up and sing after her drinking sessions! This flick is pretty sick and sleazy but believe it or not it's done in such a campy and looney way that you will actually find yourself laughing along with cuddly Olaf and his dear mother!!! I won't give anymore away. This is the triple xxx version (the film elements do not match but they do not appear to be inserts) so there was more than just poor naked gals! The actress that played Mary (Anne Sparrow) was actually pretty good and she definitely had a lovely figure! But its really 'Olaf' and 'Lila' that stole the show here we even got a quick glimpse at 'Lila's' disfigured body (just kidding actually the old dame was in pretty good shape. I would have wanted to see more of her with singing of course!!) she did have a scar along her left cheek (on her face do pay attention)! This was an American-Danish co-production and as I've written so many times before only in the 70's could they have gotten away with a barbaric and sadistic piece of work like this one ( but of course plenty of enthusiasts like myself already knew that) it's pretty bad. The reason I'm only giving it 3 stars the pacing was slow and unfortunately the production-values here were very low ($10000.00 more from uncle Harry could have raised the bar!) not the best lighting or camera work.

" I watched this movie yesterday on a lovely Saturday afternoon. Maybe i should have went to the beach because all this movie did was make me restless. Yes indeed it was a quality movie with great acting by Ian Mckellen and Lynn Redgrave. The thing that ruined it for me was Brenden Fraser. I believe he was miscast. It seems as though they gave him the part because he looks so much like Frankenstein. He should have played Frankenstein and someone like Pauly Shore could have played 'Boon'. (just kidding of course!)The overall look of the film was beautiful. It had alot of style. Another problem I had with Gods and Monsters though were the doldrum periods of the plot where Whale and Boon would sit around and psycho-babble with each other and try and pick each others brains apart. They did this too many times in the film and the reluctancy of Boon was a real turn off. Brenden Fraser does play a GREAT homophobe! I also found it repulsive that Whale allowed Boon back into his life even after Boon degrated him and did nothing short of spitting in his face. Whale should have just kicked him to the curb!The part I don't understand is why Whale had such a fascination with Boon. Why did he do so much for this guy? Boon came off as such a jerk a no brains kind of guy an opportunist. Was Boon just a piece of you know what to Whale? If so that is really sad that he chose to cherish and embrace someone like Boon. That's what I didn't like about this film! The weak characters! ",3.0

The Frankenstein myth was interpolated into a grander metaphor to some extent but not to complete satisfaction. I pretty much 'got it' by the middle of the movie and was expecting the movie to traverse some higher plateau on the back of the conflict and metaphor but it never really got there and the second half didn't add a whole lot of sparkle. I was disappointed. It didn't live up to being what I had been expecting from all the glowing reviews. Like the monster it had all the parts but there wasn't any transforming thunderclaps no touch of the gods. The ending was rather simple not at all profound and the last scene was a bit contrived even silly in an amateur film-school kind of way. I suspect others are taken with this film more by the nostalgia it conjures than by the dramatic resolution of its storyline. It's just not the great film of its reputation. It's worth watching but there are many films worth watching and many others I'd much more recommend for your time. This one you could easily go without unless maybe you're a real Frankenstein or gay buff but even then it's not sufficiently strong on either of those themes. It had great potential. It was 'close but no cigar'--or maybe that should have been Mr. Whale's line.My review update",3.0

" I hadn't read this one of Heinlein's in many many years when I picked it up and was leafing through it in search of an answer to a trivia question. Doing this with any Heinlein novel is dangerous; in short order I was snagged into re-reading the entirety of this one. Heinlein has often been cited by many of today's scientists and engineers as their inspiration for getting into the sciences and this book is a prime example of why. As the story of Matt Dodson young man in training to be a Space Patrol officer it is a very typical adolescent-to-man portrayal. The first half of the book deals with his training from the rigorous testing to eliminate those who don't have what it takes to descriptions of the myriad of subjects an officer is expected to know. The second half details his experiences and on-the-job training as a school graduate from long boring hours in space transit to the finding of a missing Patrol ship to his experiences in the art of negotiation with Venusian natives. At no point does this book ever become boring; I fully believe Heinlein could have written a twenty page exposition on watching grass grow and kept his readers totally engrossed. Some of the details he presents on the art of astrogation and space flight may go over the heads of some younger readers of this book but it is precisely such details that will get those readers interested in studying such subjects.This book was written in 1948 and some allowances must be made for that reason such as the description of Venus as mainly a hot and very wet but habitable planet (at the time he wrote this this was one of the main scientific suppositions about conditions on the this planet). At the same time it is quite incredible just how accurate he was in describing everything from rocket ship design fuels space walks space sickness space habitats eating utensils designed for space use the utility of a global peace-keeping force (such as the U.N. which was just being formed when this was written) and even predicted the use of microwaves for cooking (this prediction is hidden in a throw away one-liner comment typical for Heinlein as he quite correctly portrays the inventions of the future as mere commonplaces of their time).Some have called this a watered-down version of Starship Troopers and there is some validity to this point as there is very little of the heavy philosophy that characterized Starship Troopers here (although like all of his 'juvenile' novels there are strong threads running throughout on the importance of honesty duty personal responsibility and the proper role of government) but much of the same flavor regarding military organizations.Other than Matt himself the characterizations are somewhat one-dimensional in some cases near caricatures drawn with broad strokes. This is not necessarily bad in a book intended for young readers who have not yet reached the sophistication to see the world in many shades of gray but is a little grating for the adult readers. The depiction of Burke supposedly good enough to survive all the testing and early training for the Space Patrol but so dunderheaded as to effectively kidnap a local Venusian 'mother' and not see anything wrong with his actions is especially grating.This book was the basis for an attempt at a TV serial",3.0
" Not Heinlein's best boy's book but a good one. I hadn't read this one in many many years and it didn't hold up quite as well as the one in my memory. But at any rate in today's world a half-century after Heinlein first published this book I really appreciate how Heinlein hammered in the need to look with respect at those who are different from ourselves specifically in regard to Oz's work with the Venerians. The 360 on the 'pie with fork' lesson was great.I also like how the book's protagonist Matt isn't necessarily the sharpest pencil in the box. He works hard he tries hard he makes mistakes and he tries to do the right thing. But it's often other characters who take the stereotypical hero's spotlight. I think there's an important lesson in there that Heinlein tries to impart.As is often the case Heinlein is pretty harsh on parents especially mothers but I made a decision long ago that this is simply part of Heinlein's baggage and his many positives outweigh this negative theme.

" There aren't many operatic versions of 'Sleeping Beauty' so it was a delight to realize that the composer of 'The Pines and Fountains of Rome' had produced this charming work back in the 1920s (revised in 1933). Interest was piqued by a recent production at Spoleto (Charleston) which traveled to Lincoln Center this past summer. I didn't attend either of these productions but the reviews caught my attention and I ordered this the only recording of the work that I know of. The piece is pretty well conducted and overall well sung although the Italian diction is not as idiomatic as one would wish from this (mostly) Slovak cast. Guillermo Dominguez (Prince April) and Adriana Kohutkova (Blue Fairy/Nightengale) are standouts. It's a lovely work that certainly deserves another recording this time with plummy Italian voices that are more comfortable with Respighi's style. I have to admit that the Act III setting in the 1930s from the 'fairy tale time' of Acts I and II is something of a shock especially the appearance of an ugly American (Mr. Dollar Checques) and the 'fox trot' finale. Perhaps more sympathetic performers could have brought it off. ",3.0

" This is one of five of The Steve Miller Band's first five albums that's gotten a well deserved new mastering job. Thankfully there's no compression that makes good sounding older period music hard (or impossible) to listen to. Or any bad remixing that also destroys the original sound we all remember. The sound on this reissue is clean and fairly crisp with a bit of warmth reminiscent of the original LP mix. Is this a quantum leap in sound quality? No but it does sound good. Sound is so subjective-what one person hears as good-another hears either nothing better-or hears even worse sound.I've read that the EQ on these discs is overly bright. But I'm just wondering with new mastering using present day equipment if we're now able to hear more detail in the high end than on previous issues. That may cause some listeners to hear it as slightly brighter. Listening to the album 'Children of the Future' (with that great original LP side-long suite on 'Side One') for example I can hear much more detail on the higher end-acoustic guitars are more discernible in the background as are snippets of background vocals. But I have to say that I never thought this particular album (the original vinyl LP) sounded all that great a bit muddy sounding-even with Glyn Johns at the controls-but that may be just me. On the other hand the band's next (vinyl LP) album 'Sailor' sounded much better to my ears-again with Glyn Johns producing. As I said sound is so subjective.Since this particular album has been difficult (or impossible) to find I thought I'd choose this new edition for review along with a bit on the other four albums. The disc is snapped inside a tri-fold cardboard holder with a pocket for the 11 page booklet. The booklet has a few photographs from Miller's personal files and an essay based on a recent interview with Miller. The other new editions are similar in format.Overall this is a worthwhile album (and one of my favorites) but not the best effort by the band-now reduced to the core trio of Miller Lonnie Turner-bass/guitar/background vocals and the great Tim Davis-drums/background vocals. This is before Miller's approach changed somewhat to more pop leaning radio friendly songs and his orignal band had splintered. The core trio is augmented with the addition of either Ben Sidran or Nicky Hopkins on keyboards and Glyn Johns or Minor Wilson on guitar. Davis really shines vocally on the song 'Your Saving Grace' where his lead vocal makes you wonder why he didn't get more of a chance to sing. And check out 'Little Girl' and 'Just A Passin' Fancy In A Midnite Dream' for a bit of that old Miller Band sound. Another good song is 'Don't Let Nobody Turn You Around' but fans will have their own favorites.There's no extra tracks on this edition but the lyrics are included. But for instance the first Miller Band album does contain the song 'Sittin' In Circles' as a bonus. On first listen it doesn't seem to really fit in with the original album-the song sounds to 'poppy' and a bit lightweight but it's good to have it included. The sound on all these albums is similarly good so if you've wanted to replace your old CD copies (or couldn't find them on CD-like this particular album) this is a chance to own them with good sound and updated (but not in depth) liner notes and photos. Hopefully the price will come down some for these albums but even if that doesn't happen this is a chance to hear these albums with much more agreeable sound.I've been waiting for someone to reissue these albums with new mastering (and extra tracks-oh well) which does justice to the band's sound. I just wish that someone would release all the old period Miller Band music that's still squired away in the vaults-along with the live sets that are still hidden away-or maybe an all inclusive box set encompassing the first five albums and related studio and live tracks-maybe someday. But for now these new editions are well worth hearing. ",3.0

They whine and scream more often than not and the comic relief is painfully uncomfortable. The main character... a young new recruit... is a noise machine.

" For those buying this Deadly China Hero dvd you are getting a [junky] version of the original film Last Hero In China. The distributors for Deadly.. are known for bootleggin movies and cutting scenes out so look for the right one if you intend to check this film out. This film is the Jet's second to the last installment to the Once Upon A Time In China (OUATIC) series. It's nothing spectacular in my opinion but it's not a bad film either. Tsui Hark who did the original OUATIC series is not a part of this film; instead the dirty Wong Jing directed this film which kind of hurt it a bit. Yuen Woo Ping still provided the choreography but I've seen better. Wong's aunt or love interest (Rosamund Kwan) is also out of this picture. Jet plays Wong Fei Hung once again and he moves his school temporarily to a new location. The school ends up next to a brothel Fei Hung soons discovers corruption and kidnappings of women taking place around the town. Officials want to get rid of him and of course Wong wants to save everybody as usual. This is probably all you'd need to know about the story because it really is not that interesting. Right from the start I could not take this film seriously at all. It was trying pretty hard to be funny and sometimes it worked other times it failed miserably. It felt like watching a parody of OUATIC. The MA were good but not great; there was simply too much wirework and fake elements involved. It's one thing if the movements look real but wirework was pretty bad in this film. There's a scene where a bad official slaps his hands on tiles and this brings them up flying at Wong; all of a sudden the official decides to literally swim or glide across the ground afterwards...couldn't help thinkin what was the point of it was but anyways. The bad official (Alan Chui?) also has one of the most annoying laughs you'll ever hear. There were bits and pieces of battles that stood out but not one ENTIRE fight scene impressed me. The Shaolin Master Killer Gordon Liu(Lau Kar Fai) was also in the film as a bad guy but director Wong Jing clearly wasted Liu's talents by not using them. In addition the outcome of his final battle is pretty pathetic. There is a fight between Liu and Jet that starts off decent until the flying elements came into play...sigh...like I said bits and pieces. Cheung Man is also in the film but her MA is strictly wire based and made her look like a ballerina...nothing impressive. As everyone already mentioned here the last battle involves Jet in a chicken suit fighting a group of baddies dressed as a centipede. It's kind of silly but the battle that follows between Fei Hung and the bad official is nice. There is still wirework done here but this battle probably had the most REAL and serious MA. Sadly there were many shots that made me realize that Jet was doubled for many of the sequences...sigh...you'll also see Jet try to use the drunken style though unconvincing and some great moves came afterwards and probably is the base of my rating. Some of the moves here are pretty brutal and they stayed in my mind even after the film. Overall I would call this an average movie. OUATIC 1-3 totally outshines this film because there was more meaning to it and I felt more for the characters plus the MA was far better. I can't really recommend you to buy this film but since it is pretty cheap why not. Besides it's part of Jet's Wong Fei Hung history. It's definitely worth checking out so you can make your own opinions. To me this film is trying too hard to be funny and sadly I found myself laughing at scenes in the film that probably weren't intended to be funny. Better Jet films are his original OUATIC 1-3 Fist of Legend (his best) Swordsman II Tai Chi Master Kung Fu Colt Master Shaolin Temple and more...hope this was helpful check out my other MA reviews thanks for reading.

" I'm not sure what movie Amazon thinks this is but it's actually a Wong Fei Hong pic starring Jet Li. And it's not his best either.

" Before reading this review you should know that this film is the same movie as 'Last Hero in China.'This film is as the title of this article proclaims an interesting combination. Combination of what you ask? It is a combination of the Historic Chinese Martial Arts extravaganza and a Tom Green movie. What makes the film interesting is that the combination is not as bad as it sounds. Jet Li once agains plays the role of Wong Fei Hung as he did in the Once Upon A Time in China historical epics but this Fei Hung is a very different character from the more serious Fei Hung (particularly in the first OUATIC) we are used to.In essence this film takes the fairly standard school versus school and style versus style conflict and extends it to a Dragon dancing competition (mirrors of OUATIC here but wait) with Jet Li's masterful Dragon dancing interrupted by a villain in a Millipede suit. Jet Li loses the initial competition due to various circumstances which include the villain's nepharious influence. Jet Li recovers and battles the Millipede in a Chicken Suit in the final battle. Chicken suit? Yes a chicken suit. I told you there was a touch of Tom Green in this movie or is it Adam Sandler? Doesn't matter.Typical of the Jet Li/Wong Jing pairing films this is a less than serious affair. If you go in expecting wonderful wuxia wire-fu and a few laughs in a no budget free for all you will have a great time. Jet Li is an amazing martial artist and somehow this film works.

" Strictly speaking a prequel to a prequel this is the third book in the series. The first 'Hotel Transylvania' took place in mid-1700s France; the second 'The Palace' in late 1400s Italy. This one takes place in the first century of the common era in imperial Rome during the time of Nero and a bit later. There are something over a dozen books in the series all told plus a few spinoffs of books about Olivia Clemens and Madeline two of Saint Germain's lovers who become vampires themselves.The series so far has been quite good; I continue to feel somewhat guilty for not rating the books higher than I do. But there is the continuing stylistic affectation of placing a piece of correspondence after every chapter which I continue to find minorly distracting and there is a scene in this book that seems to be simply out of character as it has been so far defined for the main character. We have been given to understand that many of the traditional legends of the weaknesses of vampires such as the inability to cross running water and the inability to withstand sunlight are conditionally true in the world of Saint Germain; that is to say they are true but can be overcome so long as he stands upon his 'native soil' so he has learned to wear special shoes that are hollow and filled with soil from the land of his birth. Yet in this story when deprived of his special shoes and forced to fight giant crocodiles at midday during a blisteringly hot Roman summer day in the arena (in water) while constantly commenting on how ill and unwell this makes him feel he's still able to function well enough to slay several crocs and survive. (It's not giving away critical plot points to reveal his survival considering that he exists in the previous two books of the series both of which occur historically later than this one). He doesn't as near as I can tell even get a sunburn. This is just so far out of line that I feel the need to dock the book a star just for this one scene; otherwise the book is quite well written.If you are a fan of traditional vampire fiction you may possibly find yourself disappointed with this series; there are many elements generally found in the vampire genre that are missing from these books. But if you like historical romance or even historical fiction in general and don't object to the concept of a heroic vampire protagonist you should find this book and probably most of this series quite enjoyable.

" ***1/2'The Village Barbershop' is a modest unassuming little indie comedy set in the unusual locale of Reno Nevada.Art Leroldi (the wonderful John Ratzenberger) is the cantankerous old-school barber whose business has fallen onto such hard times that he is at risk of losing the establishment that he and his recently deceased partner have run for many years. Against his better judgment he hires a free-spirited young woman (the endearing Shelly Cole) to serve as both his accountant and fellow haircutter at the shop. At first both Art and his conservative customers have a hard time adjusting to this frightening new-world-order of gender equality but through her expertise with the scissors and the force of her personality Gloria eventually manages to win them over to her side.Given this undeniably slight storyline it's obvious that this movie was never going to exactly set the world on fire - but within the admittedly humble parameters that he's set for himself writer/director Chris Ford has succeeded in creating a sweet and amusing regional comedy filled with sparkling performances and generous dollops of local color. Ratzenberger and Cole have charm and likeability to spare and their scenes together are played with understated warmth and humor. Their performances alone compensate for the occasional overindulgence in indie-brand quirkiness and feel-good sentimentality.A minor film but an enjoyable one. ",3.0

" The film about a man who is haunted by the visions he sees. On the surface it appears to be a ghost story but it turns into the exact opposite of that. The movie is very real so expect to see what you would never see in an American film I.E. children dead or murdered. I liked the idea that 'The Uninvited' doesn't sugarcoat or sensor the events that occur. They show you so that you understand just why the characters are so broken when they recall certain events in their lives. By the title of the movie you would think 'The Uninvited' pertains to some sort of entity but really it pertains to a paranormal ability to see and experience things you would rather not.In the fashion of Korean horror this isn't something that you've seen before. The story isn't exactly predictable and problems just don't smooth themselves out. I thought this was a good film. I just assume that the name may confuse people with the American movie which this is NOT! an Asian version of.'The Uninvited' brings its own sense of eeriness that's not your typical haunted ghost story which it may seem like at first. I rated it 3/5 stars because although it's an interesting film it's also a pretty depressing film. The theme of the movie seems to be despair and the only relief from it seems to be death or suicide. The characters seem to have no real resolve to their problems other than to just 'deal with it'. I didn't like the idea so much that even though both of the characters had people around them that cared for them and wanted to help them they still felt so lonely and isolated in their issues.The ending also didn't exactly answer a simple question that I think most people wanted to know about the main character and his fiance.

" I read the book and thought it would be a good series but unfilmable as a movie. I was wrong. The movie concentrates essentially on the modern 19th wife and the murder of her husband. It's not necessary to have read the book to follow the story and it is a good 'who-done-it?'. The movie does refer to the history of the wives by brief scenes that take place in Salt Lake when Brigham Young was the profit. Those scene inform the viewer as to how we came to be where we are today. It's a film-making strategy that in this case works well. Probably because those scenes aren't flashbacks.The movie adds colour to a dour book and illustrates (peoples?) the story with the multiplicity of the wives",3.0
" There's not much going on in this CD other than mindless background music. It's mostly all improv and while it's tolerable it's nothing special at all. The vaguest of themes is hinted at in the tiniest of ways and some tracks have a touch of feeling to them but nothing to impress significantly.If you want a CD in which a few lesser genres such as jazz blues and mellow get the weakest of workouts then go ahead and get it. A excellent example of modern day video-gaming scoring it certainly is NOT. ",3.0
" The Case of the Haunted HusbandStephane Clair quits her job as a hat check girl and hitch-hikes to Los Angeles. She is picked up by a wealthy man who drinks and drives fast. There is an accident; people are injured and one dies. But Stephane is found alone in the car and charged with manslaughter. A friend obtains Perry Mason's help. The owner of this car says it was stolen and has an alibi. But did he loan this car to a friend? His insurance covers a stolen car but not one driven by him or an agent. The investigation of the owner reveals some curious facts derived from telephone bills (long distance). This leads to a Mrs. Warfield in New Orleans. A promise of a job brings her to Los Angeles (Chapter VII). This chapter gives an example of proper behavior in a job interview even one designed to investigate the applicant. Mason puts detectives to work on the witnesses. But Mrs. Warfield outsmarts Mason and Drake (Chapter X)! They find the missing driver but he won't testify in court to clear Stephane.Information is found that would clear Stephane. But the chauffeur becomes unavailable to testify like the missing driver. The police and district attorney are wary of Hollywood influence (Chapter XIX). An interview in the hotel room with the widow points to the likely suspect and confirms Mason's suspicions. Mrs. Warfield is found in hiding and the story ends. The ending seems logically flawed to me. Its as if Gardner was afraid to offend Hollywood and the powers behind them. One interesting scene is where a person leaves their hotel room and doesn't lock the door; what a sense of security in those days.The ending seems logically flawed to me.

" It was a good look at this program. It was a well done documentary and I appreciated learning some new things. How many even know about this part of the Samaritan's Purse organization? I'd never heard of it (not that I am an indicator). You can see the sacrifices and challenges that are encountered (as well as the blessings!) of the families that take these three children into their homes while the children wait to have a surgery that they could not have otherwise. The surgeries give them an extension to their lives. The youngest would not have lived for many more years if left untreated. In the process they are also given the opportunity to accept Jesus (the youngest one may not understand at the time). They can go home and share this new relationship with their families also.The documentary isn't something you will be able to `just watch' -it'll give you a case of lump in your throat if you don't just break down and cry. But at the same time there are many instances where you will smile along.This isn't something that I would normally watch and that is why I felt it was 'ok'.

" I guess agreeing with the 'big time' reviewers isn't something that I can do with this one. Winning the National Book Award is just ridiculous. Were there no other books entered in this category?This is my second Nathaniel Philbrick book (Mayflower - being the first) and I was very disappointed with it. I knew that the author likes to throw his opinion as historical fact but it wasn't as clear in Mayflower as it is in this book. It is obvious that Philbrick is mostly taking a couple of written diaries (as there are only two or three written accounts) and he milks them as much as possible. That would be okay but the constant references to other shipwrecks and disasters that have no bearing on this one bored the snot out of me. Also his constant reminder that the Donner party ate themselves (being chronologically after the time of this book) really should not have been included for any reason.Philbrick took a short story and tried desperately to turn it into a longer one. At that he was successful. The expansion of the thought process of the shipwrecked victims made it sound as if the author talked to them and put down all of their thoughts. Since we know that he did not it was overkill and misplaced in an historical nonfiction book.The number of references to things that had no bearing on the story reminds me of a high school term paper and you need to have 'X' number of references and therefore you make sure that the people reading it know that you had 'X' number of references.It is an interesting story but not very well written.

This made it very hard for me to have any emotions at all while I was reading and therefore made this book less enjoyable for me! I would only recommend this book to you if you are interested in the story behind the Essex (which as I said is very well researched and detailed!) and not in the emotions! ",3.0
" This is a gripping chilling interesting true story of the sinking of the Essex whaleship. I think you can spot some thematic material and symbols waiting to be created from this story in a work of fiction. Herman Meliville did and Philbrick's book makes a good pre-reading to 'Moby Dick'.The beginning and the ending I found to be boring and dry. Those sections contain more of the historical backround and afterword.It is a great story of survival and endurance- testing the limits of the human body and psyche. If you liked this book I recommend the book 'Hatchet' which is also a survival story altough a fictional one. In the Heart of the Sea is much like the sea survival stories of 'Jaws' and the 'Perfect Storm' so I don't think there is anything special about this book. ",3.0

But I do have to admit that the way Nathaniel philbrick described the little close nit town was very descriptive. He made it seem like you were looking a photo of it. The book did give me some incite into how it was back then. How life was on the ship not seeing your family for years. After you get through the first couple of chapters the book starts to pick up. It is like you are reliving the whole experience of the sinking of the Essex. I would not recommend this book for animal lovers being one my self reading what they do to the whales and other animals just to survive made me sick. But over all it is a fairly good story. ",3.0

" Nathaniel Philbrick has done an absolutely masterful job digging out the world of the sailors on the Essex on their fateful voyage. The book is filled with detail of the day-to-day travails of the seaman & officers and interesting speculation about the relationships between major players in the drama. The book would be of particular interest to people intoxicated with the sea & sailing since there is plenty of information about how sailing & navigation was done (right & wrong by this group) in the early nineteenth century. Where I found the book to be weak is in the general history the context in which all this occurred. I prefer a book that uses an incident like this as a centerpiece to elucidate the social political economic cultural situation of the day. Philbrick does this in places particularly in the first few chapters but then the book degenerates or better said narrows its view to the Essex voyage itself abandoning the historical context. The book would have been much much longer & less focused had it taken the approach I suggest ... but it is nevertheless the approach I prefer. That is why I gave it a 3. ",3.0

" I can't quite put my finger on it but it strikes me that there's a certain strain of superfluousness in the contemporary narrative nonfiction genre.

This National Book Award winner is a perfect example. The 'Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex' isn't exactly obscure -- Herman Melville drew upon it forMoby Dick two accounts by survivors of the actual events exist and Thomas Hefferman'sStove by a Whale",3.0
" As Nathaniel Philbrick freely admits history is replete with tales of shipwrecked castaways - and planewrecked rugger teams - eating each other.

" First let me say I am a big fan of survival against all odds types of books. I have read and loved Alive Forever on the Mountain In Harms Way etc. This would not rank up to those standards in my opinion. Of course those three books I mentioned had a big advantage - actual survivors for the author to interview. This event took place in 1820 so the author had less to go on. All that being said if you are a fan of survival books this is worthwhile. A 3 out 5 sounds right on. ",3.0
" Much has been written (and now shown on national TV) about Philbrick's 'In the Heart of the Sea'. This short (less than 300 page) historical account of the whaleship Essex will quickly send those who are fans of the genre back to the Andes Mountains of the early 1970s in 'Alive' and the New England coastline where the hearty seamen from 'The Perfect Storm' met their fate. What separates Philbrick's writing (and ultimately makes the book interesting) is the often graphic and well-researched accounting of 1820s Nantucket and the brutal lives of the whalers who made a living by going off to sea for nearly 2 years at a time. I cannot rate the book higher only because while the storyline is compelling I did not find the story of such a unique character as to separate it from other books that deal with brutal human hardships. ",3.0
" This is the tragedy of the whaleship Essex. The same tragedy that inspired Herman Melville's very famous novel Moby Dick. Philbrick's In the Heart of the Sea situates the tale of the Essex in the history of Nantucket during the 1800s. Philbrick draws on the journals and personal testimonies of the survivors local newspapers etc. to recreate an event that had an enormous impact on American history and especially Nantucket history.The Essex set sail in 1819 to hunt sperm whales which were the most oil rich whales in the ocean. The sperm whale gets its name from the stores of clear oil located in its head which turns cloudy white when exposed to air; this oil burned clearer and brighter than any other whale oil and was in high demand. These whales could provide hundreds of gallons of oil and one successful whaling expedition could make captains and investors incredibly wealthy.About 3000 miles off the coast of South America the Essex is attacked and sunk by a vengeful sperm whale that looks to be about 80+ feet in length (double the size of the average male). In three small whale boats the 20-man crew embarks on a legendary adventure. For 93 days they are stranded facing starvation dehydration and mental deterioration.The unspeakable things that happened during those 93 days are revealed through Philbrick's assessment of the history and the literature. He unveils not only the circumstances that would lead men to cannibalism but also the circumstances that would lead men to temporarily abandon their morals and political and religious affiliations. For example in the face of starvation they sacrifice a black sailor. This sailor is the first person to be killed for food; despite their abolitionist roots the Nantucketers opt to save their fellow white sailors.Philbrick also focuses on the families of the sailors who stay behind on Nantucket as their husbands brothers fathers and sons embark on two-year expeditions. Wives see their husbands for a few months at a time only to be left for years on end. Children grow to ages two and three before they even meet their fathers.Overall the book is a fascinating history of the lives of whalers their families and their native Nantucket. The history about the island has me itching to visit! My only complaint is that the book is a little dry and the numerous quotes and embedded quotes make for slow going. I've read two books while reading this one!P.S. I've never seen the word 'sperm' so man times in my life. ",3.0
" The author of this book surely has a lot of experience with veneering but in my opinion there are better ways to do things than some of the ways he suggests. For instance he uses regular wood glue (PVA) to apply veneer by letting it dry and then using an iron to reactivate the glue. I would never trust this to hold over the long run and PVA glue is not the best kind of glue to use with veneer anyway. It is to thin and it doesn't dry to a hard glue line so it will allow the veneer to creep with seasonal changes in humidity. He also never mentions using a vacuum press. While a press might not be for beginners it is the easiest best way to veneer a flat or curved panel. ",3.0
" Some parts of this book are very educational and others so bad they are weird.As a previous reviewer notes the author's approach to vacuum pressing is to make his bag by gluing and taping two thin plastic sheets together making a bundle of more plastic sheeting around a [garden?] hose to make the connection valve and then connecting the hose to a wooden block covering the intake port on his air compressor (Don't try this at home; constricting the intake port on many piston driven compressors can screw up the valves). He reports that 'real' vacuum presses are expensive and he finds vacuum pressing not terribly effective...If you've never veneer vacuum pressed before you might not recognize that as the hominid precursor approach. I'm surprised he shows use of a veneer hammer instead of the more cost effective stone club method. For a lot of (better) info on vacuum pressing google up the Joewoodworker website.As others have noted some of his approaches to glue preparation are a bit odd as well. Coating with thinned wood glue and then ironing to heat activate... I suppose you could do it that way I'm just at a loss as to why you would want to. There are several other approaches and glues that bond better are less mess to handle and generally produce better results. 'Course if you bought a load of past its prime Tite-Bond at discount I guess it would make sense (and be consistent with his vacuum press).Some good stuff some just flat out weird.

The Series3 was not able to connect to establish the wireless connection. I did follow the troubleshooting steps that came with the adaptor but I think it is possible that the adaptor was too close to the wireless router. In other words the adaptor might have worked just fine if I had the TiVo Series3 box further away from the wirelss router. Since I had a hardline available on the wireless router I plugged the Series3 into the router directly using CAT5 cable and the Series3 connected with no trouble after that. I'm not guessing about the adaptor being too close to the wireless router; in another wireless setup I read that the wireless device might not receive the wireless signal if it was too close to the wirelss router.

There are many good 802.11g USB network adapters available on the market at affordable prices but you'll find the TiVo series 2 DVR is not compatible with most of them. I really think TiVO should update the network technology of their box. They're way behind. I settled on the TiVo Wireless G USB network adapter because it was one of the few that works perfectly with my TiVo but it does not support security features that I really wish it did support. For example the only wireless security it supports is WEP encryption. It does not support WPA at all. And by the way if you decide to use WEP encryption make sure you use a Hex key not an ASCII key. When I tried to set it up using a 128-bit ASCII key it would not connect to the wireless network at all.

The TiVo box arrived on 4-6-10 and I still have not received the Wireless G adapter (as of 4-9-10). The estimated delivery date is 4-14-10; 2 full weeks from the order date. Before everyone cranks up their rants I absolutely realize that by choosing 'Free Super Saver Shipping' I agreed to the slowest delivery speed. I'm simply posting this review as a warning to other techo-junkies (like myself) that if they want to actually receive the adapter at the same time as the TiVo box they may want to spring for faster shipping!! It's almost painful to know that the TiVo is connected and ready to go but I can't run the set-up (and see if it works!) until the adapter finally arrives (some day). Full disclosure",3.0
" I got the TiVo G USB to replace my aging linksys B adapter and to be able to run my wireless network in pure G mode. I didn't really try many other options since there are limited G adapters on the market that are known to work and certified by TiVo. I was hoping to get better reception but after plugging this adapter to my TiVo Series 3 the signal strength went down from 'Very Good' on the linksys B to 'Good' and sometimes 'Marginal' with the TiVo G. I was a little disappointed to see that this pricey adapter has a weaker antenna than my 5 year old B adapter. I'm typing this review from my laptop next to the adapter which is currently getting excellent signal strength. I would give this review a lower scale but I understand that there are other G devices running in my unit and building where the B was probably by itself without much interference.Just to give you a background on my setup I am running a Netgear WPN824 wireless router Tivo Series 3 HD and two laptops on pure G mode only. In addition to my wireless devices there are 16 other wireless networks within range from other units in my building. For security I'm running 128 WEP + MAC address access control list to make sure that only my devices can connect to my router.So out of 5 starts -1 for antenna performance -1 for lack of WPA support and price.Don't let my review discourage anyone because there are many satisfied customers. I am just trying to be realistic based on my experience. I still love it and don't intend to return the product because it looks nice and I'm actually planning on repositioning my wireless router.

" Unfortunately there are so many wireless adapters on the market and very few are compatible with my TIVO. This one was and it's more expensive then generic ones from Walmart/Target.I recommend just getting one on the approved list simply b/c I bought like 5-7 different ones from Target/Walwart thinking who cares I just need a wireless adapter since I have no land line. Only to discover I wasted a lot of time returning them all b/c they didn't work.So just to save time/aggrevation get one approved on the TIVO website.

" This is a sweet doll it does come with wonderful accessories and the magic pacifier is a good idea. (Basically a magnet in the pacifier causes the baby's eyes to close and open when the pacifier is removed.) This is where the good ends and the disappointment begins. The eat and wet function well just make sure you have the doll diapered or wrapped when you feed it as it runs right through. I did not have the problem one other reviewer had our tubes were inserted thank God. The 'squeals with delight' is out and out false advertising. The other reviewer was correct... it's a dog squeak toy sound. Really a company of Zapf's caliber should know better. I think people who purchased this doll should be given a rebate. Anyone interested in sending a petition to Zapf and Amazon regarding this blatent lie regarding this product? I should have guessed no batteries would indicate no real sound functions but I've seen Zapf pull off some great features with dolls in the past and thought because of the eyes there had to be some gimic with this doll as well. One additional complaint regarding this doll... the clothes are astronomically expensive to buy (real baby clothes are cheaper!) and yet the outfit the doll comes with is poorly made and not that nice looking guilting parents into the purchase of at least one decent outfit for the doll. My solution... do a web search there are free sewing patterns out there for doll clothes that will fit this doll. Shame on whoever claimed this doll 'squeals with delight'. ",3.0
" This album is misleading because it's just Ponty's best from 1987 - 1991. I much prefer his material from 1975 - 85 in which he focused on the violin and not the electronics he's dabbling with these days. But because this is the best of three studio albums it makes for a fairly strong regular release and saves you from the crap. I enjoyed this more than I thought. Grover Washington is on one track and the final song is a wonderful piece by Chopin. But the bottom line is if you ever purchase a Ponty album make sure it's on Atlantic Records not Epic unless you have all the Atlantic albums. ",3.0
" First take this CD for what it's worth not by the standards set before and after it. So it's not '461' or 'Slowhand.' That's not necessarily a bad thing. Like Neil Young. Clapton didn't always put out albums for their top 40 value. On the contrary. Particularly at this point in his career Clapton had earned some license- for better or worse depending on who you ask- to do some things he wanted to do and let the Billboard charts be danged. Yet despite that he could still spit out songs that garnered radio play like 'Carnival' and 'Hello Old Friend' two of my favorite Clapton songs. Also like Young as well as Dylan Clapton was partial to using one of the several lush sporadically used female background singers of the time. In this case that voice is Marcy Levy who if her voice were absent from the song 'Beautiful Thing' it wouldn't be as smooth or melodic. In fact Clapton was so comfortable with his stature at this point in his career that he allowed Levy to sing solo in the song 'Innocent Times' as he played in the background to churn out what is in my opinion the best song on this CD. It's a real Levy tour de force albeit a brief one. For that reason itself this CD's worth buying. And while 'Sign Language' is hardly the best collaboration between 2 star recording artists it's actually a decent song consistent with this CD's tone and unmistakenly Clapton and Dylan. But also typical of albums/CDs of this time they weren't chock full of hits from beginning to end. So what makes this CD or even this era different from that of today? With rare exceptions many big name artists have CDs that contain some grizzle. Future Clapton CDs would have slicker production quality particularly after Phil Collins produced CDs put Clapton's name back in the spotlight in the early 80s. After that Clapton became something of an video darling but did that necessarily mean he produced better songs? Purely subjective. Try this CD. I challenge you to not find some appeal in it. I bet you find yourself humming at least a couple of the tunes. I dare you to admit you didn't find your toe tapping to a couple tunes. And I especially bet you find yourself wondering what else did Marcy Levy record worth listening to. I know I did. ",3.0
" 'No Reason To Cry' is in my opinion one of Claptons weakest albums next to 'Another Ticket'. The whole thing is a sloppy mess with weakdisjointed playing no cohesion or direction and much slurring from Eric on lead vocals. Where are the producers on this album? I wonder sounds like they were 'out to lunch' on most of it or maybe flat on their backs on the floor! However Marcy Levy wrote and performed well on the track 'Innocent Times'. Rick Danko Richard Manuel Bob Dylan Georgie Fame and Ron Wood make guest appearances that don't really add much of anything to the entire mess. To be fair There are a couple of OK tracks such as 'Beautiful Thing' 'Carnival' 'Hello Old Friend' and the Bob Dylan penned 'Sign Language'. His filler blues cover 'Double Trouble'and Rick Danko song 'All Our Past Times'(Both songs are covered much better in Clapton's live 1980 album 'Just One Night'.) are very good. In 'All Our Past Times' there are the follwing lyrics 'All our past times should be forgotten All our past times should be erased.' makes me think so should the master tapes of this 1976 half effort. ",3.0
" 'No Reason to Cry' is one of Eric Clapton's lesser orginial studio albums. The problem is in the material which is simply not up to the incredibly high standards of Clapton 1970s masterpieces such as '461 Ocean Blvd.' and 'Slowhand.' That's not to say the album is awful. In fact there is hardly a bad song in the mix. It just doesn't live up to expectations. For example the Clapton-Bob Dylan collaboration on the song 'Sign Language' is pleasant enough but is not the masterpiece you would expect from these two music giants.Overall 'No Reason to Cry' should be primarily of interest to Clapton's ardent fans. Casual listeners should start with one of the two albums listed above or one of his anthology albums instead. ",3.0
" I'm a git player over 35 years and love EC. This release on his comeback trail in '76 is not much to get happy about. Reports circulated at the time of these recording sessions had found EC drinking very hard and surrounded by the same type of musicans involved. Ex Herion addicts usually go to Alcohol to relieve the JUNK pain from Herion. It is no reason that this release fell on deaf ears when first issued. EC's playing is stiff and mediocre. Even the bonus track added on the CD 'LAST NIGHT' does not leave you filled or do any justice. He is stiff on all his git work on this album. A shame. Maybe I'm just to critical but others felt the same way. judging by the cover of EC in a bar with bottles of liquor in front of him answers these downer gaps. ",3.0

" As a ShoDan assistant instructor of Shiho Karano Kenpo Karate I strive to educate myself about the martial arts. I've found some good books on the subject and I'm always on the lookout for more. Since 'The Karate Dojo' has been in print since 1967 I figured it must provide valuable direction. It does mainly by portraying a snapshot of martial arts history that challenges the budo practitioner to forsake mediocrity for mastery and character.The book has three basic parts. First the author provides a somewhat Karate-centric view of martial arts facets such as the dojo belt ranking systems and character self-analysis. In the second section are a number of martial arts parables that teach through historical narrative. Finally Sensei Urban uses the last chapter to discuss the 'contemporary' Karate scene (i.e. the mid-1960s). The overall theme is one of extreme discipline and perseverance within the martial arts necessary to achieve a seemingly mystical level of physical mental moral and spiritual ability. In other words it takes hard work and commitment to become a 'weaponless weapon.''The Karate Dojo' is a quick read - I finished it in less than a day. There are a number of stylized line drawings and black-and-white photographs to complement the text. It's a portrait of an era in Karate that seems to be almost mythical - and mostly lost at least in the West. The author fondly discusses harsh daily training under the strict discipline of a revered master in a dojo where everyone's practically family. I've tasted some of that but nothing close to what Sensei Urban describes. And that's where I differed with the author. Yes optimal mastery of any activity requires the type of commitment he advocates and that's OK for some. But I believe it's possible to benefit from a consistent and disciplined practice of the martial arts without making an all-consuming religion out of it.At any rate despite some dated aspects and a monkish focus on martial arts that may be beyond what many would bear 'The Karate Dojo' contains worthwhile insights for the martial artist. If nothing else its high standards may challenge one to take their current commitment and practice to a higher level. ",3.0

" This book though poorly written has a story to tell though it could have been better told by someone who knows how to write. It is however an easy quick read and moderately interesting. It does have some merit in as much as it chronicles the author's ascent of Denali.Most of the book is spent recounting the time during which she and her team mates were trapped on Denali at 14000 feet caught in one of the most severe storms on record which saw eleven people perish. Her description of the horrendous weather conditions and sub zero temperatures which pinned her team down for a period of about two weeks is graphic though repetitious. She was lucky to have been with two experienced guides who knew what they were doing. This is undoubtedly one of the main reasons she and her team mates survived their ordeal.Disconcerting are her repeated racist references to Asian climbers. Her comments are unworthy and make her sound ignorant. It cannot help but affect one's opinion of her and that opinion is unflattering.

Well being someone that is over weight and has a problem with determining what an actual serving is poses a HUGE problem.

" I was drawn to this book by its title.

Perhaps George Washington L'Enfant and the early capital architects were into astrology I don't know. Perhaps the sign Virgo has some supernatural significance for the well being of the capital and the country I don't know.

The book moves slowly the author did his research and I have no quibble with that - I know this topic; however the significance of why the Freemasons chose to do things that have been done in the manner that they did is just not revealed I was really disappointed because there is some terrific information out there and I am well versed in this topic based on my own research. I am wondering if this is because he wasn't allowed to 'get to the point' no pun intended. I think the true reason he left out answers to why (Astrology is important but he didn't say why among other points never addressed is because Mason's aren't allowed to share the key precepts of their faith or beliefs to the uninitiated - that leaves out all females and many men.There are many good books out there to understand the significance of Masonry -you won't find them by doing an internet search using the word - avoid the publications that will come up will give you books written by Masons (who often don't share that information up front) these books reveal much of the same stuff rehashed instead try books by William Schnoebelen John Ankerberg David Weldon Tom C.

" Ever wonder why the city of Washington D.C. was an explicitly designed city but the streets are laid out in a seemingly illogical manner? Wouldn't you design a simple grid pattern for a city instead of the bizarre pattern found there?David Ovason attempt to give meaning to this street pattern and for some of the architecture found in the city. His analysis is brilliant but I find myself wandering in the sometimes meandering pattern of his investigation just like the layout of the city. It would probably help for the reader to have a background in astrology/astronomy to give greater meaning to this analysis for I often found myself scratching my head.It was interesting to learn that Pierre L'Enfant the French Freemason given credit for the design of the city was later sacked from the construction team for criticism of some of the builders for messing up his design. He would later go broke wander around the city and pester congress for a greater share of payments that he thought were his for the design of the city. He died broke and is buried near Arlington House. ",3.0
" As one who works in the Capitol I was intrigued by the title. I bought this book many years ago and recently got around to finishing it. David Ovason is a well-educated man and has written a very thought provoking book.He sets out to prove that Washington D.C. was designed and built largely by Masonic architects. And this is true. But he gives many facts and footnotes to support this.It is a well-known fact that Benjamin Franklin was a Mason along with architect James Hoban (who designed the White House) Presidents Garfield and Polk and Statue of Liberty sculptor Frederic Bartholdi.And although textbooks teach that the federal city was the brainchild of French engineer Pierre-Charles L'Enfant Ovason argues that Washington Jefferson U.S. Surveyor General Andrew Ellicott and others modified L'Enfant's original blueprint. I think the author makes a great case but I got lost several times because I could not keep up with it all. Many facts here!Masonic symbolism appears in the marble plaster concrete glass and paint facades of the Federal Reserve the Library of Congress and other landmarks. This book the result of a decade of thought and research establishes the plausibility of Ovason's theory. I appreciated the time that went into it.This work looks at the Capitol the Washington Monument city planning and the numerous zodiacs located throughout the city. AOther reviews have recommended it for academic libraries with collections of architectural history Masonic or esoteric literature.

" As a countertenor I am always searching for recordings from new and up and coming singers. I had heard some wonderful things about this album and decided to buy it. It was very interesting to hear 11 differnet versions of the famous Ave Maria Text and I believe that the contrast and pacing of the album is excellent. My sole fault lies in the vocal production of this young singer. MOST of his range is sheer and glittering. He has a lovely tone and clean projection and resonance. Like many countertenors the sound at the bottom of the range takes on a rather covered sound at times but this is characteristic of the voice and is not terribly distracting most of the time. In matters of vibrato everyones taste varies but there are moments when the vibrato is a bit wider and unstylistic than might be generally appropriate. Unfortunately like many singers with rare voice types who feel the need to 'prove' themselves to an often difficult public he decided on several occasions to pass the tessitura at which his voice sounds natural and unforced. I can sing to a soprano Db but I would never do so in public performance or on a recording because I can acknowledge that there are parts of my voice that are better left in the rehearsal studio and left OUT of the recording studio. All in all this is NOT a BAD album. The material is rich and interestingly arranged by the production team and nearly of the vocals are clean and pleasant. Just beware of the top notes when the range is more suited to Dramatic Soprano than for Lyric Countertenor. ",3.0

" In the age of overdeterming macroeconomic factors ETFs high frequency trading hedge funds etc. technical analysis is a total waste of time for the average Joe sitting at his workstation trying to day trade. For every chart that shows a meaningful pattern there are 5 that show no pattern at all. The technician out of necessity of his methodology is forced to make meaning of a chart which is likely just a random collection of observations. Just because a price happened to bottom or top twice consecutively at the same point doesn't mean that there's 'support' or 'resistance' at that level. Sometimes there are legitimate support and resistance levels but more often than not those are illusory. Support or resistance levels evaporate and reset all the time.Fundamental analysis puts the investor in a much better position to actually succeed in my opinion. Earnings price book value growth forward earnings debt levels etc. are not subject to any interpretation. They are what they are. It might take any given stock a long time for it to align w/ its fundamental valuation but the relative predictability that one sees in P/E levels for different types of businesses of varying sizes and growh prospects makes the fundamental school the more rational approach.Also anyone who believes that markets are 'efficient' hasn't paid much attention to markets.

" There is an old adage that two are better than one. But not according to Lydia Sanderson a stiff and awkward pioneer woman of the 1890's who left Pennsylvania after her husband died to make a stake in northeast Oregon country and the Blue Mountains. Fiercely independent and willing to face the hardships of living alone on a remote mountainside this story by Molly Gloss is based on original journals of the time and painstakingly accurate in its details of the area.The theme--women can be independent and do it as well or better than men--is a popular one in these modern times though its spin gives me pause. Was this really so strongly portrayed in those days? To the author's credit however she did at times give a hint of Lydia's loneliness. 'I shall not see Evelyn Walker now nor any other woman until the Spring and must harden my heart not to be Lonely.'Gloss's plain and homespun style of writing wove a pleasing tale. It made me want to unravel her story until the end. She has a rare ability to detail the mundane while twining together different story lines in a unique way. Her realism made me believe she knew her setting well--albeit often painting it in shades of gray with words like dull and sooty. (I live in these mountains. When it came to her descriptions of the weather and the poverty of the times she nailed it!)In the end however I was left unsatisfied feeling a certain hopelessness and fatalism. I found myself wishing Lydia Sanderson would indeed find that soul mate even pathetic Tim Whiteaker her male suitor who could at least make her life somewhat easier.

" I ordered these because I knew from other reviews that these bulbs are a white headlight not blue tinted. I can see where someone expecting a blue headlight would be dissapointed but I want a bright white headlight so I'm happy with them in that respect. What caused me a lot of headaches is the fact that these are 100W bulbs rather than 55W. It does not state this in the product description. I was trying to avoid other 100W bulbs due to the problems they can cause only to end up with 100W anyway...Here's what happened with my 2007 Mazda 3. After 1 week my headlights went out. I took it to my mechanic to have him check the headlight circuit and he told me that these are 100W bulbs. He said that the adapter that the bulbs plug into on my Mazda were slightly loose and it looks like the bulbs were arcing. He cleaned them out and tightened them up and they've been working fine for a few days (the bulbs were fine). He said he thinks my wiring is OK to handle it. The headlights are very bright now just beware of the 100W issues. ",3.0
" I bought this game to play with my two oldest children 4 and 2. I know the game is not for 2 year olds but she is my partner when we play. My four year old loves the theme and the dice mke it easy to understand what to do. But some games start to drag on and you just want to get the game over with. Even with this drawback the game is fun for kids to play. The dice and the mice are made of wood and well made. The bowl on the other hand is thin plastic and ours is already bent after just a few plays. I would say this is a okay filler game to play with your kids but 'Hiss' (also made by Gamewright) comes out to play much more often. ",3.0

" I thought this book was enjoyable to read. Say a decent book to read in the park on a nice afternoon. Nothing too intense. It was a little slow in the middle but still had enough interesting stories to keep the reader going and find out what happened to this young woman. It picked up the pace toward the end almost putting off too much for the end; the intense reunion with her father graduating Harvard and plenty of wrestling team metaphors for her growing self-realizations -- all within the last few chapters. Compared to other books I've read it wouldn't be a 5-star because it wasn't particularly life-altering funny witty or original. A well-rounded 1st novel for Summer though. ",3.0

" Pirates of the Caribbean At World's End is without a doubt the best looking Pirate game I have ever seen! And so it is to my utmost disappointment that the gameplay does not make use of such outstanding artwork. This 'T' for Teen rated game follows the movie plot of Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest and the newly released Pirates of the Caribbean At World's End. The game takes players to many of the locations found in the two movies such as Port Royal Tortuga Isla Cruces Singapore Davy Jones' Locker and of course the Black Pearl and the Flying Dutchman. Unfortunately little to no room is given to explore or interact with these magnificent looking environments. Instead the game sends the player from one un-imaginative fight into the next while collecting random objects for extra rewards along the way. Some jumping and balancing sections try to mix things up but even these activities quickly become repetitive. Pirates requires absolutely no thinking because only one objective can be completed at a time and only one predefined path can be taken. The game offers two different Multiplayer games where players can duel each other in a sword fight or battle in splitscreen mode with or against each other to defeat enemies. Overall Pirates of the Caribbean At World's End is (another) mediocre movie tie-in action game. Leaving a lot of potential but no follow through. ",3.0
" This product is a double negative. It's so bad it's good. That might seem strange but I'll explain why in a minute.This video games retells the events in the last two Pirates of the Caribbean movies. However if you're serious about the story skip this. This video game doesn't retell the story very accuratly. Only half of the plot details happened in the movie.As for graphics I agree with the other reviewers. The animation is not glitchy and looks very nice. However Jack Sparrow's peculiar movements looked more entertaining in the movie. In this game Jack Sparrow looks over animated; like he's too drunk to stand up (but miraculously talk straight). Other than that nice graphics. For a game developed for a fast release it certainly looks pretty.Now we get to the big question. Gameplay... The gameplay is seriously boring. Serious video gamers will be un-entertained and would rather play Halo. However people who have had bad days will love this game. If you want a game that is easy to play and win you can play this. If you've overworked your brain in the office you can come home and let this game play itself for you. This game is a stress reliever.If you're a serious video gamer than done bother renting this. However if you do get a copy save it for a very miserable day. ",3.0
" I bought this game on xbox 360 because I had a lot of fun playing it with my sister on wii. It is not the same. I found it was difficult and boring. The graphics are better on 360 and that was kind of cool but I am not even sure if its the same storyline. I know for sure there are things in the xbox version I never saw on the wii (and vis versa). I recommend renting this first to see if its your kind of thing or not. Don't waste the money without trying it out. ",3.0
" Pirates of Carribean is a moderatly fun game with richly detailed graphics in third person viewpoint. The weak part about the game is the combat. The attacks performed by your character (J.Sparrow) J.Depp and later on in tandem with Orlando Blooms Character are pretty simple button mash combo sequence. You can press A for sword attack and X for punch attack .Also after filling up a portion of your finish meter you can perform a finishing kill by pressing the buttons that will flash on the screen to do a finish move you will see a prompt on screen telling you which button to press in sequence to perform a finish kill. Which always starts as Hold LT then the press or hold the corisponding button prompted on screen. Like this for example Hold LT. then press Y hold B. Or sometimes just hold Y . Whatever is on the screen ..very simular to Spiderman-3 button mashing cutscenes. The only problem with this is its way too easy to just kill an enemy by just pressing A (sword slash) over and over too kill about 90% of the enemies. While the other 10% require at least one finish kill to eliminate them. You also have a handgun with (get this) 3 bullets.woo hoo!! So authentic to that era..lol.you can kill an enemy with your eyes closed because of the auto-aim hold LT. ... The A.I. is horribly easy to kill. One time I tested out to see if an enemy would hit me at all. And he just stood there circling me without even hitting me or even trying anything at all and I was right in front of him finally I just pressed A three times and he was dead Lame very Lame. And these same enemies repeat themselves over and over with some of them waiting there turn too fight me. Anybody who played ERAGON? well its nearly the same here in this game. With Pirates only being slightly less lame....Another combat form is when you meet a boss type character you go into 'DUEL' mode . The camera switches into side scroll mode simular to Mortal Combat. But thats where the comparison ends . There's 3 Circles on the left or right of the combatant . One being a high attack oNe representing a mid attack and one representing a low attack. Now get this when the circle turns grey its telling you in advance how the fighter is going to attack you so you can successfully block the attack (how polite) so if you see the upper circle turn grey you push left stick up. And if you make a successful block it will turn green .Or red if you dont. Well this feature takes away the fun out of it as your constantly looking at the 3 circles more than the fighters. Which makes it unbeliveable lame . Its nothing like Soul Caliber or a Mortal Combat at all. There are some great features about this game which are the graphics are pretty darn good. Some of the towns reminded me of Oblivion. And there are some great fog and lighting effects. And the cutscenes look quite good.The levels are pretty much straight forward linear with a little back-tracking here and there. There are some puzzly type things like you play an organ in a certain sequence to get Davy Jones's key. Its pretty much kindergarden-1st grade puzzles. Kids up too 13 will probably LOVE this game as the combat is very Eragon-ish. But at least the camera is fully controlable so there's no fighting characters off screen. The only side scroll is the easy as pie boss 'duels' . Johnny Depp character looks incredibly good . As well as the squid guy and the hammer head guy . The graphics are a very strong point in this game.Another nice thing is you can switch between Jack Sparrow and Orlando Bloom in combat and control both fighters. Another nice thing is the soul trap sword its a flaming green sword that traps enemies souls for whatever eason other than achievement points and high scores postings on LIVE . I hope there is a cheat soon where I could play the entire game with a flaming sword because it only lasts for a short period and to recharge it you have to find and collect mummified heads. Also you can climb certain wallsropesladdersships masts when prompted too which is pretty nice. It is a somewhat decent game in the adventure part but the easy as pie enemies will have hardcore gamers wishing for more but the kiddes will love this game. Would I buy it? Nope. Only if I had young kids. ",3.0

" The authors have done reasonably well in presenting general design/architecture issues in the area of object relational database management systems.Poor editing however abounds in this book. The reader must wade through paragraphs of opinionated comments distracting (and often incorrect) pontifications and complaints. For example hardware designers are roundly chastized for failing to support Multics-style protection-ring logic in today's microprocessors.The text is heavily sprikled with superlatives such as 'explosive' 'incredible' 'astonishing' etc. It is irritating from a reader's perspective to be digging out good technical material betweeen snippets of pro-Informix marketing hype.When not engaged in hype the authors sometimes make curious and possibly false assertions. In one instance they claim that Wal-Mart's huge data warehouse is utilized to 'rotate stock'.

" I am reviewing the 1st edition.Dr. Stonebraker is a pioneer in the field of object-relational database management systems (ORDBMS). He writes with confidence and clarity; he knows the subject matter because he was one of the early innovators. The book is mercifully short and to-the-point. It is well organized and it includes an index references short code samples and plenty of diagrams.The book assumes you have some background and experience with existing relational database management systems and SQL. It would also help if you have some basic understanding of implementation details like B-tree indexes and cost-based query optimizers. You should also have an understanding of OO concepts like inheritance and polymorphism and some experience with an OO language like C++ Eiffel Java or Smalltalk.Armed with this background the book is an excellent overview of the motivation architecture design and features of ORDBMS. I especially liked the chapters on SQL parsing and query optimization and also the discussions of how inheritance affects query and trigger processing.If you've never been exposed to the ideas and concepts of 'object-relational' this is an excellent starting point. If you have the background described above you will be able to read this book in a few sittings and come away with a basic - albeit incomplete - understanding of the field of ORDBMS.I say 'incomplete' because Dr. Stonebraker fails to write about the dark side of ORDBMS. For example once pointer-like references are introduced the system runs the risk of 'dangling pointers'- precisely the kind thing a purely relational system elegantly avoids. This issue is never once mentioned and yet I know for a fact it is a danger that must be dealt with on one commercial implementation I have used. There are other issues to be confronted and understood. C.J. Date has written extensively on the subject. Although C.J. Date's writing is sometimes long-winded and pedantic you won't truly understand the ORDBMS topic until you've read what he has to say.The book is also a compelling marketing promotion for the product once sold by Stonebraker's now-defunct company. Given the 'feature matrices' and other comparisons in the text it is clear that his product was the hands-down winner at the time the book was written. This is all ancient history however. The book shows its age and bias. First of all Stonebraker's company Illustra (later renamed Informix) was recently acquired by IBM. Secondly very little is said about Oracle which has since implemented a very respectable OR system of its own. Lastly most of the other vendors he mentioned have fallen completely off the radar map. These days all the database vendors have most of their attention turned towards XML and raw OLTP throughput. So it seems like 'The Next Great Wave' predicted by Stonebraker never fully materialized. Perhaps the 2nd edition of the book has updated the vendor list and features matrices.I wish more was said about his early work on the 'POSTGRES' system. If you're interested you can find out much more about POSTGRES and its open-source offspring PostgresSql by using any Internet query engine. There is now a whole cottage publishing industry built up around PostgresSql. If you want to experiment and explore ORDBMS PostgresSql may be a good choice.Based on what I can see in the table of contents the 2nd edition doesn't include too much new material. Dr. Stonebraker has added a chapter on application servers. I know from his other work that he argues that middle-tier application servers are wrong-headed because business logic should reside in the database itself - where it is physically close to the data.I rate the 1st edition of the book 3 stars because (1) It is dated (2) No space is allotted to the problematic issues of ORDBMS (3) 'The Next Great Wave' never seemed to take off as predicted.Nevertheless it is a worthwhile and useful book to read if you are interested in the topic. The 2nd edition will surely have an up-to-date comparison of the ORDBMS vendors as of 1999. ",3.0
" While the first and third books in the trilogy are good exposure to the Halo Universe the second is an almost complete failure as a novel. It does have its few redeemable qualities but any 'scene' featuring the Master Chief or an event in the game feels mostly forced. It's like the author played the game through on easy recorded what he did and fleshed it out to make the central plot line. Pretty much every part that the author had to come up with on his own is good but when considered as part of the whole it's just.... Not good fiction.The other two books are good in their own ways.I would suggest purchasing the books if you're interested in Halo. ",3.0
" All three of the stories were written well and the plots unfolded in riviting fashion as one who had played the game would expect. However with that said I must state that one of my primary expectations weren't met or even addressed.At the end of the first Halo game we see 343 Guilty Spark tooling through space apparently unharmed from the final cataclysm that befell Halo. We also were left with the impression from various pieces of dialog through the game that like Neo (Matrix) the Master Chief (Reclaimer) had been down this road before.While I hadn't expected the prequel The Fall of Reach to provide much in terms of explanation of these open items I did have full expectations that these items would be either more fully developed or even explained in the sequel First Strike. Disappointingly none of the open items from the first Halo were discussed.It would have been appreciated if the Amazon Review had made mention of this crtical ommission beforehand. I might well have still purchased the Trilogy but now I feel a bit cheated. ",3.0

" This album was the first I heard from Sparta. The songs are each powerful in their own respect and Sparta truly has a sound of their own. They touch on the emo/screamo genre often but are not afraid to branch out and try some off the wall stuff.

I would also like to say that I prefer Sparta over Mars Volta. ",3.0
" I would have given this record three and a half stars but amazon won't let me. Ok so when i first picked this up it didn't really do too much for me. I mean it sounded like Sparta but was no where near as varied or experimental as Wiretap Scars. I kinda left it for a few days after only giving it about 2 listens. For some odd reason i felt like giving it another chance to sweep me away. And that it finally did. It takes a bit of getting used to but sparta has made a cohesive album of gut-wrenching powerful and emotional songs. You can definately tell these guys are giving it all they've got and thats what really counts. I've been listening to this record nonstop now for last 3 days and its quickly becoming one of my personal favourites. I find though that its better not to compare it to Wiretap Scars because then you would be missing the point. I beleive Sparta is continually trying to re-invent themselves and releasing another record of the same material would not do this. Porcelain is an alotgether beautiful and emotionally charged record that will definately take you on a ride as long as you're willing to let it. ",3.0
" My friend bought the album. I listened to it today at work. It was .. bland.Coming from Sparta I was surprised. There were a few good parts. The opening song itself led me to high hopes and 'Lines in the Sand' is also impressive and different. However I give this album 3 stars for a few reasons.One the album itself looks like it was made to be returned. The font used for the album cover is reminiscent of something that would be found on an N'sync album. Okay I can overlook that. The artwork however .. what artwork is there? Just whiteness with pictures of the band members. Okay I can overlook that too right?I read the lyrics. They aren't impressive at all. Basic words in their expected orders. This is where I began to frown upon the album. However I kept a tad bit of hope.Then I stuck the cd in my player. Within about 6 songs or so I was done. I had heard it before. It was the normal thing. A few good guitar patterns here or there something experimental every now and then. But overall it was just .. normal. The only thing that seemed to give the album an edge was the vocals. That and a few very nice moves in the structuring of the songs.Other than that not much impressed me. ",3.0

" When I saw the video for 'Stick 'Em Up' I was taken in by the song's catchiness as well as the fact that the video features the lead rapper in a boxing match! So I went out and bought the CD not knowing whether or not the risk was worth it...Well I've listened to the CD a few times already and all I can say is that if you like the Beastie Boys and Rage Against The Machine then you'll love Quarashi. However the Icelandic foursome doesn't quite match up to the aforementioned bands if you know what I mean. The Beasties had developed wit and cleverness in their lyrics and music while Rage had an intense passion and focus in their music. Quarashi could use some improvement in their lyrics and sound. Like I said before it's not all that bad but their music and lyrics come across as slightly corny and juvenile at times (i.e. 'Your mother is a stripper' or 'I come on the mic like a fascist' (or something like that)? Please!) Still I definitely see potential in this band and I believe they can be a much better band given time. After all it's only their debut album. Heck look at the Beastie Boys. They've definitely come a long way since 'Licensed To Ill'! ",3.0
" Being a fan of rap/rock you have to imagine my reaction to Quarashi when I first heard them... There aren't enough mainstream rap/rock bands out there so every time I hear a new band like this I look at it as a rare indulgance. First off the first song I heard was Mr. Jinx and I was unimpressed by the facts that the hook was the only thing pulling the song together and the weak lyrics weren't helping. It was recently while playing a game for PS2 called Amplitude that I heard the song Baseline and I really enjoyed it.While doing some research on the band I was upset to find that the band consisted of four regulars three rappers and a drummer who sometimes used a drum machine. In all honestly a lot of the songs on this CD aren't bad but I've yet to find anything other than Baseline and Stick Em' Up really extroadinary. Don't get me wrong these guys are pioneering what's left to be explored of rap/rock but by doing so they're trying out a lot of things that really don't work that well and to make things worse the variety makes for a painful album because there's nothing you can really get into without hewaring something different a little later.So I've made it clear that Quarashi is no Rage but some of their songs are worth listening to. These guys still need to find their niche and for christsakes learn how to play their own instruments. ",3.0

" Even though I read 30-odd pages of Communion before coming to the conclusion that it was just a little to far-fetched I thought I'd see what the movie had to offer. Well to be quite honest it did nothing to convince me that my initial conclusion from the book is unjustified. Are we seriously supposed to believe that aliens who apparently have the ability to visit our planet from great distances have such impracticle body structures and that they've come all this way simply to[...] probe Earthlings? I'm by no means a sceptic when it comes to this topic and am willing to give anyone the benefit of the doubt so long as their story isn't completely absurd--which is the case with Communion.The DVD contains a very short clip of the surgical removal of a supposed alien implant from some guy's arm. This may sound sensational but it most certainly is not. Not surprsingly we are not allowed a close-in look at this 'alien implant' and no less surprising the clip ends with a statement to the effect that the nature of the 'device' has yet to be determined.

" The movie'Communion'which is based on a contoversial New York Times bestseller by the same name is in no respects as convincing as the novel written by author Whitley Strieber. Strieber's novel and movie both tell the 'true' story of his personal encounters with apparent aliens which Strieber has coined the term 'visitors' when refering to them. The movie lacks in several departments. One obviously is the budget(or lack there of) which takes away from the movies ability to portray realistic aliens or visitors or whatever they are. The aliens which are now easily recognized by there large black eyes in modern American pop culture look in this movie quite literally like cheap rubber balloons.(probably because that's what they are)Strieber's book however does not have the need for cheesy props to convey his story in convincing detail; probably the reason people had an interest in his book back in 1987. Ask anyone thoughwho has read his next several books on the same subject; if they are capable of thinking logicallythey will most likely tell you about the steady flow of contradictions ever present in his writing.This brings us to a second flaw in the movie which is",3.0

I don't recall much of the book being anything like the movie. There are no explainations to the visual circus that is happening on the screen. The movie really left me scratching my head.

" Let me begin this review by stating that I am a huge fan of Christopher Walken. OK I'm done. Do yourself a huge favor and buy the VHS version of this movie. The director's cut is so bad in places it's cathartic. At the very least it's enough to make you want to wash your brain out with soap and Walken's as well.I bought this because it is supposed to be one of Walken's finest works and it truly is. He is such a sensitive honest actor that even the most miserable script flows like water across his performances. I think he's a national treasure and like national treasures subject to horrific abuse. This movie unequivocally abuses Christopher Walken and lends credence to the rumors that the actor suffered a breakdown of sorts in his 40s. Just watch the out-takes of him cavorting in the most explicitly banal ways with plastic jumpy things that vaguely resemble a very bad joke by Arthur C. Clarke.ONCE you climb back down from the walls and IF this DVD survives a well deserved fling across the room and a naughty chuckle you may want to watch it again. This is not a joke. You spent money on this DVD you deserve to get something out of it. IF you discount the whole alien nonsense and view it from the perspective of a man coming to grips with a disintegrating mind complete with cheesy special effects (as most maudlin breakdowns entail) it really is quite good. Toss Whitley Streiber his wife and kid WATCH Walken as he rationalizes all this bizarre information in his intensely personal performance which is extraordinary. Read your own meaning into it achieve what you want and see a truly gifted actor dance perilously close to the edge of madness. ",3.0

" When I walked in to class the first day of school  he told us get out some paper and write this down. I thought O.K. just probally those boring class rules again. He said read Eli Whitney and the Birth of American TechnologyI thought oh how cool we get to read a book! So I found the book and read it.Here is my comments and summary.I was amazed to learn that we were not doing to good economical in the 1700s. England got mad at us because we were no longer doing things they hoped America wouldso we went our way and they went thiers.America started declining in economics because we no longer had the machinery that England had supplied us with. We kept declining because we no longer knew how to do anything independantly. Suddenly we could grow cotton! Pulling the seeds out of the cotton was hard labor and the colonists could only produce 1 pound a day. Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin to make the labor of picking seeds out of cotton easier. He was not very good at reading but doing figures was easy.This helped him majorly in inventing the cotton gin and many other inventions. If you are interested in America's struggle for economics in thr 1700sI would highly recommend this great book. ",3.0
" Yet another branch on the Frankenstein family tree FRANKENSTEIN'S DAUGHTER (produced by Astor Movie Corp. in 1958) is one of the nuttier entries in the unofficial franchise series.Dr. Oliver Frank (Donald Murphy) keeps his real surname of Frankenstein under wraps so he can make bizarre secret experiments on his boss' niece Trudy (Sandra Knight). Thanks to a 'fruit punch' mixture Trudy transforms into a hideous monster with a unibrow and a face like cold porridge. Dr. Frankenstein later murders Trudy's best friend Suzie (Sally Todd) and grafts her head onto the body of another mis-shapen monster creation dressed in a trendy black leather jumpsuit.FRANKENSTEIN'S DAUGHTER a long-time favourite for monster fans has all the key ingrediants for a classic cult movie",3.0

" It's a little gem of a book ~~ one I've had in my bookcases for a long time. This past weekend with everyone in my family struggling with the stomach flu ~~ I picked it up to read it as I needed something light and easy to read. It is a lovely insight in a family of three women of three generations. It's mostly about Charlie the midwife and all-around nurse. Her daughter Sophia and granddaughter Margaret were secondary characters but their stories are just as charming.Charlie grew up poor. She married the river ferryman. After their daughter Sophia was born they moved inland. Charlie kept her midwife practice going and soon her husband abandoned her to work on the Ohio River. It was just Charlie and Sophia till Sophia married a man who made a mockery of their wedding by wearing yellow shoes. While Sophia's daughter Margaret was still young Sophia became a widow. Then Charlie moved in with them and this is the basis of their story. They lived through life with stories of people and ailments love and friendship through the years.It really is a charming little book. If you love stories on mother/daughter relationships this book is for you. If you like stories about people living in rural areas where community is very important this one is for you. It's my first Gibbons book in a long time and reading it is just as sweet as stealing an afternoon to read it!4-16-07 ",3.0

" I was suprised at how gossipy William Bradford was. He told tales about his neighbors and friends and described how the pilgrims constantly bickered with traders and their benefactors over money. My whole fantasy about what I thought the Pilgrims were like has completely changed. Now I consider them petty self-righteous gossip mongers. The book was good for general information about preparation for their trip and what they actually did when they got here but as far as historical fact goes I was unimpressed. Bradford discusses people who stray from the flock 'outsiders' who get girls pregnant drunkards and preachers who were not to his liking.

" I purchased one of these coffee makers because the Mr. Coffee brand has been around for quite some time and it didn't cost a fortune. While the Mr. Coffee coffee maker worked good and made coffee as it should it does have a few design quirks. First of all the carafe is designed horribly. You can't pour a cup of coffee without it leaking down the side. This made it a pain and a mess to pour any coffee. Another less serious issue with it is the fact that the window showing you how high the water level in the coffee maker is frosted and makes it kind of difficult to see what the water level is (being that the unit is white). While this coffee maker is OK and does what it is supposed to there are better ones on the market for your money. ",3.0
" This book was released in Australia last year. Unlike most Lessing books I found this 1 unremarkable. Overall it reminded me of an angst-free 'The Four Gated City' (my favourite Lessing read). Compared with the 'The Four Gated City' instead of an island off the west(?) coast of Britain we get impoverished AIDS-ravaged Africa. The African setting and characters are a stark contrast to the well-nourished middle class London characters - affecting. ",3.0
" Structured in two sections set in London and Africa The Sweetest Dream is an interesting chronicle of the turmoil of western ideology in the post-World War era. Lessing bitterly attacks the dogmatic views on communism and justice held by leaderships which were soon forgotten when they rose to power. Instead her heroines are women (Julia Frances Silvia) whose political positions are not so defined but who rise above their circumstances to provide care and support to those around them. The section set in Africa is particularly intense and vivid. On the other hand plotwise the story meanders too much and often loses focus specially in the 60's part. I got the feeling that the novel would have improved with better editing. ",3.0
" but I wanted to finish it- I liked the characters - the comings and goings that politicals tend to attract. I wanted more development of some of the characters- this book has a huge cast! I really liked the idea of these homeless wandering young people and the idea that there are people who would open their homes to them. good character studies here I think ",3.0
" The Sweetest Dream begins as the story of Francis Lennox and the group of disparate youths who come in and out of her life and her London home. The era is evoked by Lessing in her typically intelligent prose with characters who are well-defined and a plot that although very loose is always interesting. Halfway through the book however the young Sylvia leaves to become a doctor in ravaged Africa and when she arrives there the book loses all its focus. It's a steep decline from the book's enjoyable first part and is emblematic of Lessing's tendency to (in her later works) go off the deep end and never really find her way back. Lessing is interesting throughout the book for her powers of observation as well as how she defines the character's desires and the way they intersect but the book nevertheless quickly becomes a tedious chore to finish as the plot offers a dwindling amount of storytelling for the reader to hold onto (or even be interested in). The end result is a mess a beautiful one that is written in earnest with genuine compassion at its center but a mess nonetheless. Tepidly recommended for Lessing completists only. ",3.0
" A good plot diluted with far too many sub-plots some of which were rather contorted.With remarkably few words this author can conjure up a vivid scene e.g.(pg.14)'she would go slowly upstairs leaving behind her on the stale air the odours of flowers and expensive face powder.' However at other times the story is bogged down with far too much detail.I liked some of the social and half-humorous statements that popped up from time to time. e.g the author's take on international conferences where 'they get paid to travel to some beauty spot and talk nonsence....they take off every day to see the lions and the giraffes and the dear little monkeys and I don't think they notice the land is perishing from the drought.' (437).There were a vast number of characters in this book making it difficult to keep track of everyone. What became of Clever and Zeberdee? We don't know. What became of Rose the journalistwho came to Zimlia and tried to undermine and wreek havoc for Sylvia? That thread was dropped unceremoniously. Why so much attention to Colin's daughter Celia at the very end? Above all how does the name of the book fit this story? ",3.0

" Thomas Hardy while certainly an extremely talented author seemingly had the knack of producing Victorian-era soap operas which never fails to depress even the most cheerful soul. Sometimes his depressing stories has a message that produces a somewhat cathartic reading experience (as with Tess of the D'Urbervilles) but with The Mayor of Casterbridge all we get is utter negativity. This mayor is one twisted selfish and self-loathing individual. He seems to live with a rain cloud over his head and doesn't quite understand how it is to be loved. Fun guy? Nope. And there isn't even a happy ending.Bottom line",3.0

" My giving this less than five stars has more to do with my reader experience than the novel itself. I'm just tired of neurotic English characters who are obsessed with class (are they ALL obsessed with class?) and destroy themselves due to inherent character flaws. Henchard is hot headed and makes bad decisions. He drinks repents drinks spirals out of control. This is almost a cliche in novels now. I suspect Hardy might be lost or relegated to Freshman English classes as the canon grows and embraces more 'diversity.' In short Dickens' characters are more interesting. Forster's visuals transfer better to the screen thanks thanks to the Merchant Ivory team. I hope Hardy does not get lost in the shuffle because I actually enjoyed the prose quite a bit although I probably liked his descriptions of the town and countryside and even some of the minor characters (that old 'seer' guy who predicted the weather) who were more representative on a mythic level more than Henchard.

" Though I expected sadness and misery I was hoping for something more profound at the ending than 'Happiness was but the occasional episode in a general drama of pain.'This is a many chaptered narrative that shows how the results of good intentioned-or-not mistakes can lead to personal ruin. The reader also will lose all respect for the main character.A problem with Victorian Period literary giants I have is their long sentences. I counted one at 82 words.Would only recommend this to someone who likes a challenging read (big words and colloquial language) and who doesn't mind a depressing predictable story.'The sun was resting on the hill like a drop of blood on an eyelid.' Best line. ",3.0
" I had never been so against reading a book in my life. Everything about it seemed boring; the cover the title and even the way the pages smelled. It was only the fact that Henchard sells his wife and baby in an auction; that kept my interest alive.Even with a premise as weird as this one the book's beginning was painful. It wasn't until later on that I discovered the book wouldn't be as painful as I feared. The Mayor of Casterbridge is based entirely on irony and coincidences. Never have I rolled my eyes so many times in disbelief.Hardy created a soap opera-like world in the town of Casterbridge. This actually gave a humorous appeal to the book. After every major section of the book you can't help but mumble 'Sure...'Some people deem this book 'Depressing' however The Mayor of Casterbridge didn't once give me a similar feeling. This book is presented in such a way that it helps you laugh at other people's misfortune.I wouldn't recommend this book as a 'free-read;' But if you must choose between a bunch of boring books and this one happens to be on the list then I highly recommend you choose it. It may seem boring at first but give it a chance; Hardy's humorous look at tragedy will give you a good laugh. I mean how bad can a book be that starts out with its central character actually selling his wife and baby girl at a fair? ",3.0
" R kelly shows a different side of him on this album with tracks showing more of his pain and suffering and not just focusing on booty calls. While listening to this album I hear traces of his old hits and formats and they are not new hits just carbon copies which for me take away from the album. R kelly has some winners on this album like 'I don't mean it' and 'A Woman's Threat' and the intro track 'TP-2' is off the hook. I wish that was longer I replay that one over and over. The 'I wish' remix brings tears to my eyes remembering my falling peoples.

" I wish to give R.Kelly his props. Vocally he's been compared to Charlie Wilson of the Gap Band and Aaron Hall of Guy but he's truly grown into his own man. I'd even go as far as saying that R. Kelly is the reigning King of R&B. He's done a whole lot in his over 10 years in the business. Let me give you a brief summary of his achievements.On his first album with the Public Announcement he gave us 'She's Got That Vibe' the now classic 'Honey Love' and 'Slow Dance'. He produced tracks for Hi-Five on the side. Then in 1993 he dropped his real debut '12-Play' with 'Bump and Grind' 'Sex Me' and my personal R.Kelly favorite 'My Body's Callin'...that's just the first half of his illustrious career.He introduced us to the exquisitely sensuous Aaliyah (and I'll leave that at that). Then he did a killer remix of Janet's 'Anytime Anyplace' wrote Michael Jackson's 'You Are Not Alone' and released a third album with cuts like 'You Remind Me Of Something' and the unforgettable song and video 'Down Low'. Then he worked with the Isley brothers Mary J. Blige and Toni Braxton. In the fall of 1996 he released 'I Believe I Can Fly' from the Space Jam soundtrack which won 3 Grammys.Then he released the 'R' album in 1998 a double CD that used elements of the '12 Play' cover art. I'll say it here",3.0
" R.Kelly is still doing his thing on this album. There's few songs that is worth hearing. Track 2581015 are ok. The problem with this album is that there's no major change on his style of singing after a while you can't tell the differences.If you are a huge R. Kelly fan you should try this album. ",3.0
" As good as R's other albums have been in past this one left me a little confused. As good as the production value and arrangements were on the album the lyrics leave a little to be desired. Granted 'I wish' is definitely a keeper along with 'I Don't Mean It Part II' and 'Strip for U'. The confusion comes from R's insistence to lace the majority of these songs with sex. How can U have a song which pays homage to a passed away homie('I Wish') and another song which promises a lover true commitment and sacrifice('I Decided') and then come back with disappointments like 'Fiesta' 'Greatest Sex' 'Like a Freak'and the worst one of all 'Feelin' on 'yo Booty'. R really disapponited me with that one. If R could have taken 'I Decided' or 'I Wish' and used one or both of these songs as the theme for this album I think he would have had a real winner on his hands. As it turns out you'll just have to be satisfied with an album where the good tunes R very good and the bad ones are well very BAD. ",3.0
" R. Kelly's 2000 album was one of his most successful and widely influential albums opening the star to a whole new fanbase mostly thanks to the excellent hit singles and their following remixes. Following the epic double albumR.from 1998 he returned two years later with another very ambitious album. This album is musically as soulful as any R. Kelly project and the pervading theme through the whole album is sex. The majority of the songs are bedroom jams or vocal conversations with women his seductive style being the main vibe. But he's at his best when he lets his spiritual side show and the gospel-tinged tracks are the best on the album. There are five or six songs on here that are among the very best of R. Kelly's career. These songs are uplifting inspiring and motivational otherwise clever and the type of song that exhibits his immense talent. He really is one of the finest talents in R&B; and there are more than a few instances where he flashes his amazing potential. However between the best tracks there is a steady supply of definite filler. The album is a lengthy 19 tracks long and it would be a much superior album if it were trimmed to about 12 (like its predecessor12 Play). The first half of the album contains way too many forgettable and predictable tracks while the second half is stacked with great material. The production is the type of big-budget music you'd expect on an R. Kelly album. This album contains some of the very finest material of R. Kelly's great career but be ready to sit through some substantial filler to get to it.The introductory title track opens the album a short and upbeat opener. 'Strip For You' is a forgettable sex song some early skip material before the very good 'R&B; Thug.' This song is well produced and R. Kelly sings in a fast staccatoed style that works nicely. I don't like 'The Greatest Sex' a fairly redundant and unmemorable song. 'I Don't Mean It' and 'Just Like That' are much better; while they're not among the album's best songs they're solid and enjoyable cuts. 'Like a Real Freak' and 'Fiesta' are both Latin-influenced club songs both fall under skip material for me I wish the Jay-Z collaborated 'Fiesta (Remix)' were included on the tracklist instead. 'Don't You Say No' emits some nice musical vibes and 'One Me' is a pretty good song too. The album gets great at about this point. The beautiful 'I Wish' arguably the finest song of his storied career is a sad yet uplifting song to a lost friend speaking of life since their passing. 'A Woman's Threat' however is among the worst songs on this album six banal and repetitive minutes and his verses sound like a shopping list. 'I Decided' is among my favorites with a great hook and good performance 'I Mean (I Don't Mean It)' is a little upbeat and funky. I think my favorite song here might be the touching remix to 'I Wish' titled 'I Wish (To the Homies That We Lost).' R. Kelly does not make remixes like most artists and his remixes are entirely new compositions of songs with the only similarities being the similar subject matter. 'To the Homies That We Lost' is equally as effective as the original 'I Wish' a more personal narrative to his lost friend. The production is beautiful and this song is excellent. The pretty good 'All I Want' comes next followed by the wonderful 'Feelin' on Yo Booty.' This infamous song showcases R. Kelly at his seductive best being humorous and clever despite maybe crossing the line a little here and there. The album closes with another of the finest songs in his discography the motivational 'The Storm Is Over' a well-written gospel-tinged track complete with a dramatic key change at the end.When this album is good it's great but at its worst it's redundant and forgettable. One can't deny that this contains some of the very best songs R. Kelly has to offer and for that fact alone this is an album I recommend. R. Kelly is one of the finest talents in R&B; and much of this album is a great example of this. More economical buyers might just want to buy the half-dozen or so best songs but overall this is a worthy purchase to make. ",3.0
" I have mostly all the R. Kelly albums and if I say so myself this is not his best of work. When I listen to this album I don't hear the soulful artist like before.

Songs such as 'Just Like That'  'Fiesta' 'I Wish' 'A Woman's Threat' 'I Mean(I Don't Mean It)' and the inspirational 'The Storm is Over Now' are the ones that really stands out and the more you listen to it the more it grows on you.

" I have all of R Kelly's albums. The man has a great voice. In this album it seems that the executives may have had too much influence in his music. What happened to the R&B? I know Hip-Hop is happen'n but it's not really fitting R Kelly.This album does have it's highs. One is R Kelly's voice and his mix of Hip Hop and his R&B style. It make a sweet CD to play. The lyrics are truely R Kelly though the record label's influence does have him getting 'To The Homies'.If R Kelly really got intouch with himself he could be the 'King of Soul'. This point really seems to hold him back and this album is a good reflection of this. As the self proclaimed 'King of Soul' he does excellent but can do better. ",3.0
" When R. Kelly is at the top of his game he is one of the greatest R & B singers in the biz. Like pretty much every other Kelly album there are the standout songs but the rest are just fill-ins. Standouts on this album are the upbeat 'fiesta' the emotional 'I Wish' (both versions) the eerily bumpy 'A Woman's Threat' the uplifting ' The Storm is Over' and the slow emotional 'the Greatest Sex'. The rest of the album is mediocre. Had Kelly cut the number of songs on this album he could have made an album you could listen all the way through and love the whole thing......unfortunately for us he didnt. ",3.0

" Boot Hill is a Guiseppe Colizzi film and Colizzi also directed 'Ace High'. Spaghetti western fans will appreciate Boot Hill as an essential addition to their collections and Colizzi maintains the gritty realism throughout. Colizzi began experimenting with rapid action close-ups and handheld camera work in this film -- sometimes it works and sometimes doesn't. In the opening scene Colizzi manages to capture an 'art house' film effect which spaghetti western fans will love but traditional western movie fans will probably deplore. Colizzi also introduces the idea of an Italian-style circus to a western town which is truly bizarre yet creative throughout. But the biggest problem with this movie - besides the technically poor rendering from film - is the lack of a cohesive plot structure. The story gets far ahead of itself early on and the viewer will wonder if 'Boot Hill' is really three separate films rolled into one. There is a midway point where a third character is introduced to effect a situation where the protagonist can explain things and even tell us what will happen next! To complicate matters further the roles of two characters are never made clear. Even after watching this movie several times it is not entirely understandable to most viewers that this movie is about a large mining company trying to defraud small prospectors from their claims with a circus thrown in to create interest. Diehard spaghetti western fans love Colizzi's juxtaposed plot style and many of us watch these films over and over picking out new details every time.

" Originally published in 1922 and out of print for years *Lady into Fox* by David Garnett has recently been republished by McSweeneys in a beautiful jacket-less hardcover. It is illustrated with wonderful woodcuts by R.A. Garnett. It is a well written novella with a fanciful tone.This is the story of Mr. Tebrick and his wife who in the first few pages turns into a fox. Mr. Tebrick though taken aback by his wife's new condition still loves his wife even through her adulterous affair with another fox and her [...] kits from this affair. Even more complicating the story is that they live an area of England where fox hunting is a daily pastime - one that Mr. Tebrick has enjoyed on many an occasion in the past.So why you ask did I only give this book 3 stars? Unfortunately I knew exactly where the book was going and exactly how it was going to end within a few pages of Mrs. Tebrick's transformation into a fox; and the story played out as I expected leaving me no joy in the discovery no surprises no pleasure in the reading.This doesn't mean that others won't enjoy *Lady into Fox* only that I didn't even though this a nicely packaged and well written book.>>>>>>><<<<<<<A Guide to my Book Rating System",3.0

" I am a teacher of Egyptian Belly Dance primarily but also teach Turkish style belly dance steps in my classes. Several of my students have been asking me about this new DVD.First let me say that the DVD has many charms and is best suited to beginner/advanced beginner students but that for the serious intermediate/advanced and professional teacher or performer there are stronger academically attentive and more thorougly researched DVDs on the market. Miss Sarah Skinner cites Eva Cernik Dalia and Elizabeth Artemis Mourat as among her teachers. I have had the pleasure and honor of studying with these accomplished master teacher and performers as well and recommend their DVDs/VHS tapes for turkish (Eva and Elizabeth Artemis Mourat) and dynamic skirt dance/fusion styles (Dalia's video media and a superb music CD).For the Beginner and Advanced Beginner student this DVD includes at least one turkish traveling step I have seen taught by Eva and Artemis- and is a good start for a student with no previous knowledge base. American fusion type skirt dancing steps are also included also helpful for the beginner. There are simple choregraphies throughout the DVD well executed that will be helpful to beginner students but frankly lack the fire passion and wild playful abandon that for me is so quintissentialy turkish.The costuming section is an excellent rundown for students teachers and performers and the strongest section of the DVD. In fact Ms. Skinner has a great eye for costumes and color combinations and I would love to see a DVD from her in the future focusing solely on this topic. I am not sure if there are any up to date DVDs in recent years on this topic currently on the market at the moment.The veil number was very beautiful and again a great study for beginners and others who may not be ready to or want to do complex turns and intricate veil combinations. This number gives great ideas for 'still' shots and dramatic poses that are audience eye catching. The costume here was elegant and Sarah is a very pretty dancer with flowing dark hair who carries off the mood of this piece spledindly. I did find it odd though that the music was a classic Andalusian piece sung in spanish- on a DVD touting 'Turkish' dance.Overall a useful DVD for beginners with lots of great costume and still shot pose ideas...However perhaps a different choice in title touting the many rich and various threads of the fusion style belly dance taught and perforemd in this DVD would have more aptly described the total DVD. ",3.0
" I bought this DVD just to look at and get ideas for costume making - and this DVD is a great inspiration for that as it has a section set aside for costume making. Sarah's costumes are gorgeous - aaah those skirts - I want them! As I am sure you will too.The choreographies are ok but I will change them a little to suit my own style I like the music Sarah used. And as a drummer (Drummer/Dancer) I found myself watching and listening to the drummers instead of watching Sarah dance. I may have to go back later and watch Sarah (sorry Sarah) ha ha. But I found it useful as i was able to play along with the drummers.But all in all - I would recommend this DVD for those of you who are as mad on dancing and drumming as I am. And it is reasonably priced. ",3.0

I personaly thought that the book would be about surviving the zombie apocolypse struggling to survive mass hords and finding recources instead the story focuses mostly on there characters emotional struggles and human on human conflict. In most of the book the author keeps letting you into the characters heads about there fears and emotional struggles of what the world was and what the world is now.He also creates man on man (woman) conflict between the characters which becomes boring at times because they fight at such simple tasks such as whether or not to go into the house. finaly after about 2/3 of the book it finaly picks up and starts to have the zombie conflict. although this is the first book of the autumn series. it dosent draw much attention for someone who is looking for a thriller/horror novel.

" I did like this book and thought about giving 4 stars. I didn't because I am a gorehound. I expected hardcore Zombie violence but there was none to be found. If you are looking for splatterpunk this is not for you. I say this because I have read and watched very graphically violent books and movies about Zombies. I enjoy the over-the-top gore that is usually associated with Zombies.'Autumn' is a good book even without the gore I love so much. The book is well written and character driven. The pace gets slow at times but the apocalyptic mood is always there. There are some exciting moments and some fast paced action and the Zombies are scary. Even I was creeped out by the Walking Dead in this book.You should understand this is the first book in a series of 5 so far. I have already read the next book in the series 'Autumn",3.0
" Just finished reading David Moody's first novel of the Autumn series. I cannot say I was either blown away or disappointed.

" This story begins at a relatively slow pace and builds some steam towards the end of the novel. I think the tempo could have picked up earlier on but I realize this is just the first of several Autumn books so I can forgive the author a bit of extended character development and time to build some suspense before diving head long into the meat of what will likely be the real story for several books to come.

" The whole autumn series.. If your not used to actual english style writing you will possibly find it slow boring or annoying in some way. This series isn't too bad with it but its there. The story is really good but for long expanses it seems the characters just sit around and whine for chapters at a time. The action parts of the book are really good but these long expanses of supposed hopeless despair suffered by the characters also truely gets felt by the reader due to how boring it gets to hear some brits whine and cry about losing their families. I guess it's pretty realistic on that part because the end of the world would be pretty horrible. But it also made it pretty hard to force myself to keep reading each of the books from this series. I think the only reason I continued to read them was because I already bought the whole set and so I can count them in my collection of zombie books I've read. ",3.0
" I have to admit that I tried hard to love this book. However I could only find myself liking it. It just seems to move far too slowly.

I will continue on with the series and see if perhaps it picks up. The story IS good enough to make me want to continue. ",3.0
" This is by no means the worst book I have read but I could never shake the dark feeling that I was being cheated somehow. I wanted to root for the characters but I found myself caring less over the course of the read instead of more.

Ultimately I could not connect with them and wished they would just die already.The storyline was only marginally better and too many twists just felt.contrived. ",3.0
" I have to agree with much of Mr Goddard's review. The story is like walking in dense woods - you wonder how long before you get to the other side. Since this is a the first of a few books and it was a FREE download I'm going to give the series a fair shot with the next book. If the progress stays this slow I am out.Detail is good and character development as well but for so much time spent with the characters you'd think you'd know their backgrounds better. Zombie encounters had a unique take with their own development but they were limited. Honestly this feels more like half a book and perhaps it was the author's intention.So overall it's not a bad book but it is incomplete. The next volume may flesh it out.Look up Moody and Autumn on Google and you'll find the author's website with the download. I read it in about 3 hours. ",3.0
" David Moody Autumn (Infected Books 2002)To take an old publishing saw and turn it on its head for every million self-published disasters where cartons of bloody horrible novels sit in an author's basement waiting for a single sale there's one monstrous awe-inspiring success story where a self-published author becomes richer than Croesus based on word of mouth alone.But I'm not here to talk about Christopher Paolini I'm here to talk about David Moody. Who is not yet Croesus but probably will be given a few more years.Autumn is like nothing you're ever read.

" ...I'll just talk about the book as a physical object.The print is large and glossy. Not grade school primer large but still larger than normal novel type. But it's the glossy that gets me made it hard to read in bed with the light right behind me. The reflecting words disappear into the page. Rather aggravating.The cover has a rather gruesome illustration on the front. No problem I see gruesome pictures all the time. The back of the book though has a TERRIFYING picture. It scared me this tiny zombie face in a sea of blackness. When I read the book I had to be careful to keep it angled so that my wife couldn't see the front or especially the back cover. She would've been left climbing the walls all night.Unfortunately the cover design is slightly amatuerish and the defining line is visible between the black edge of the graphic and the black of the book cover. Eh who cares? I don't not really but it bothered me when I noticed it.My reaction to the story in brief was boredom shooting to tangible fear half way through. The writing isn't the best at points and an awful lot of time is spent on the feelings of the characters but when the horror kicks in it was upsetting.I will be buying the next book. ",3.0

" First let me applaud the author on creating a compelling Zombie world in which to take his readers through. With some nice twists (Zombies which do not immediately rise and when they do...don't immediately notice the Living..brilliant!)...this book is written with a more serious tone than some other books in the genera might be. This is a book for the person looking for a Zombie drama not a Zombie Die-Hard experience. Also because the situation takes place in England its a refreshing change of location.Unfortunately at least for me this book takes a very very very long time to get rolling. The very cool twist with the zombies I mention above is not used as well as it could have been in fact its somewhat tragic that the book didn't explore this situation further. Soon the situation changes and the standard human-attacking zombie is back in the fold. This is a cool idea that I hadn't encountered before and frankly I wished the author had spent more time here....it could have *really* made the pacing of this book unique (rather than the standard Humans-Run-From-Attacking-Zombies).Also endless reminders of the shattered psyche of the characters really starts to get in the way after a certain point particularly when nothing much is happening. When things do get rolling the story immediately begins to mirror...well.....isolated Farmhouse? 'nuff said. So we are treading on a bit of conquered ground to a certain extent. This by itself isn't an issue...but because the book takes quite a bit of time to get our characters to said farmhouse it seems to all wrap up fairly quickly...as though the Author only wanted to include enough 'meat' in this book to sell the sequel.One last thing because we are always reminded of the horror the characters are experiencing the author seems that gives them carte blanche to behave like jerks all the time. This gets old since halfway through the book I was hoping they'd all get wiped out and a new more 'deserving' bunch of humanity would appear ",3.0

" Well I got as far as page 150 and was ready to toss this book. I couldn't let it beat me w/ 130 pages left so I read on. What happened is that the book actually started to pick up and became readable.If you can handle an overly long setup and zombies that do nothing for over 1/2 of the story then you may like this little tale.There are better zombie books out there (and lord knows there are worse ones) so if you just saw the dawn of the dead movie and want to try some zombie horror I would begin w/ The Rising or The Walking Dead (TPB but the best zombie fiction out there). I also hear Twilight of the Dead is good.For me I have read most of the stuff out there and find this book falls somewhere in the middle. I will probably pick up the next book but don't feel compelled to do so.If You are in the middle of the book and are wondering if the zombies will actually do something well just keep reading and around page 160 the story will begin to pick up and ends well.

" Here's a great way to make a buck. Take some classic old 78 rpm church hollers and barrel-house rockers and sync in some beats per minute and have people call you a break-thru musical genius. I have to give Moby credit though. At least he's introducing compu-teens and upwardly-mobile handshakers to the shakes and quakes of the old school yard groove. When he keeps the field out of the studio he creates some thoughtful moments such as 'Porcelain'. And original collaborations like 'Why does my heart feel so bad' shine as well. Overall the album flows nicely and makes a satisfying salute to the joy of music. But has Moby changed the face of music? At the very least he's learned how to program its soul. My recommendation",3.0
" Play is a good album for the people who are new to electronica. I have to admit though Moby could have been more creative. He often uses a voice sample excessively. THat can be a little annoying. I hope Moby challenges himself further in later albums. I guess Play is Moby way to further finance himself. It's to commercial and plus he isn't the first to use gospel and blues singers is electronica. Moby is good but Recoil is better. ",3.0
" Hey overall this is a good album. HOWEVER... because it was such a big pop hit everyone thinks that they are really hip and into the electronica scene. THIS ALBUM IS NOT ELECTRONICA it's blues rock etc. with a beat and a synthasizer. In fact I find it rediculiously cheasy at certain parts (beginning of track 3). 'Body Rock' is kind of annoying.

" I bought this CD when it was released in 1999. Back then it seemed very avante garde. I thought I'd revisit it more than ten years on.The fact is it hasn't worn very well. What seemed new and innovative then seems rather old fashioned now. The sounds have been overtaken by better produced more technologically interesting creations and the revival of melody has left these non-melodic pieces behind. It's not unpleasant just repetitious and soporific.Moby like so many others was a fad. Briefly popular as the latest thing ultimately the material didn't have the staying power to be more than a passing success. Buy it for nostalgic purposes if that's a time you look back on fondly.

" Well you know Moby is doing something right since this CD from 1999 is on all kinds of best-of lists even making #20 of Rolling Stones's best albums of the 90's (not that the mag has any musical relevance anymore). Maybe it's because Moby puts a face to the often anonymous genre of electronica. Maybe it's because he's American and his music is more easily understood by mainstream critics than say trance or techno.Or perhaps it's because he took a simple concept- melding old blues samples with a fresh paint of electronic music and made a series of inspiring sometimes beautiful songs. 'Honey' 'Find my baby' 'Why does my heart feel so bad' 'Run on' and especially 'Natural Blues' are proof of that.But that's only about a third of the 18 tracks on this album and they all must stand judgement. And this is where the CD falls flat. You get a selection of tracks where Moby does the singing or speaking 'South side' 'If things were perfect' 'The sky is broken' and 'Porcelain' and with the exception of the latter none have music good enough to carry his thin high-pitched voice.Filling out the disc (besides 'Bodyrock' the catchiest piece with guitar and a sample of Love Rap) are a series of short instrumental fillers '7' and 'Down Slow' and simple acoustic/ambient pieces (the last three tracks). These won't be the tracks you remember.There are some excellent discs here but they're within the first 11 of 18 songs. If you don't mind skipping around you'll enjoy this but it doesn't reward a complete listen. ",3.0
" I know the personality of the performer should be irrelevant when judging the quality of the music BUT 1] Moby allowing his music to be used for car ads strikes me as immensely hypocritical considering his so-called 'green' credentials and 2] the sheer EGO of the man that came across during his recent Glastonbury performance really stuck in the craw bigtime. A shame - as I would have given the album an unconditional ***** only six months ago... ",3.0

'Porcelain' one of the best tracks on the CD is a case in point - great music but the background noise/hiss is so prevelant that I wonder whether it was introduced onto the track on purpose for some warped reason. Music rating - 5stars but the quality is the worst of all my 200 CDs and so I must call attention to this dramatic flaw - overall rating 3stars (Moby do yourself and everyone else a favor and get another recording company!!)

" In the 90's I was all about Moby. His music was in major films people on MTV were talking to him all the time and the era was just right for popularizing electronic music at the time. I've seen him live 3 times and he doesn't exactly disappoint but his music does start to wear down on me. This album was the first I ever picked up by him and I needed to review it.Off the bat most of the album is an exploration into the fascination of sampling old works into new ideas. You get at least six songs on this album devoted to nothing more than exhuming old tracks and layering them over filtered mid-tempo drums. To me it's not that exciting anymore and it feels dated. There's moments where Moby goes back to his previous albums and starts singing...that's a bad thing to me too since he doesn't have a great voice in my opinion and one track (The Sky Is Broken) is just flat-out creepy requests for communication from someone. Moby is the master of moody inspirational instrumentals and 'Porcelain' became a hit after being featured in the movie 'The Beach' because of his interesting piano-meets-breaks-meets-synthpads approach. And he repeats this formula four other times on the album making the single 'Bodyrock' a little confusing to those expecting a new Fatboy Slim-inspired album.My favorites on this album are 'Machete' and 'Inside.' They're two opposite sounds that sum up what Moby is all about. It's important to note the instrumentation on the album as well especially since now in 2011 everything has become more digitally-created and 'messed with' so I can respect some of the guitar and piano in songs on this album. However songs like '7' need to go (just horrible guitar noodling over a cheap drum beat). Overall I might buy this if you're into DJ Shadow or more generic electronic music that is used for filler but it's gotten a little bland for my taste nowadays. ",3.0
" ...spoil an album that was teetering on the brink anyway. I am not familiar with Moby's music before this album and have heard the spiel about how he changes style and direction with every album and is a musical genius who calls himself the 'little idiot' blah blah blah wurble wurble. However after hearing 'Why does my heart feel so bad?' I was prepared to give him a go. Well I can tell you none of the music press rhapsodising rang true to me. When first I listened to this album I thought all the songs sounded very alike but decided that each would become more distinct the more I heard it. I was wrong. I know all music is formulaic but this is ridiculous. As singles all these songs would be good but as an album they fail to really make an impression. An album to me is a whole piece constructed of different yet interlocking pieces. This however was rather 'variations on a popular theme' and as we know what is once popular very soon becomes old and boring. Yes these bright brittle and sometimes sad songs are individually well worth the listen",3.0
" It would be hard to imagine using words like 'sweet' 'touching' or 'moving' to characterize most standard-issue techno but they're surprisingly appropriate for the best moments of the latest effort from this enigmatic and frustrating but ultimately winsome artist.To judge from the two hundred-plus remarks already posted Moby's samplings of country gospel and blues have left the largest impression on audiences. Such deployments of field recordings in club music usually run from clever to offensive raising the same spectors of cultural piracy that haunted the white blues bands of the British Invasion but here the device is one poetic license that Moby's heartfelt sincerity elevates and redeems. His guileless expressiveness often catches you unexpectedly-- listen closely for example to 'Natural Blues' for the sudden stab of grief in its starkly understated instrumental break.Most of the eighteen tracks fall into one of three categories; African-American samplings ('Honey' 'Natural Blues' 'Run On') Caucasian raps ('South Side' 'Bodyrock' most of them not so much offensive as painfully embarrassing) and ambient compositions.This last group is in some ways the most rewarding. 'Porcelain' on the strength of its eloquence survives being conscripted into the soundtrack for Leonardo DiCaprio's latest potboiler while 'Inside' manages to break the limits of lyricism by transforming distantly spaced notes like constellations emerging from the dusk into beautifully sustained melody. It's Gorecki not Glass who's the fitting peer for work as resonant as this.Moby's six years of diffuse releases may have stretched the patience of his core constituency but a larger audience awaits if he can lose the blue-eyed hip-hop and open up further to his inner depth.

" Moby's newest cd Play is hyped by many magizines (Spin Q Entertainment Weekly ext) all giving Play great reviews. Play is a great cd. I do recommend that you don't go out and blindly buy this not knowing the kind of music it is. Play is a mix of techno rock and blues. If you are a lyrics person there is not much to these songs. If you are looking for meaningful lyrics check out some bob dylan material. But there are some great songs on this cd.Like alot of people i only listen to around the first side of Play. Play is actually worth buying for the first side. Alot of quality songs (bodyrock south side ext). The South Side song on this album is not the remix with Gwen Stefani. For that you have to buy the single. South Side much more rock than most of the songs. Play has a great upbeat sound to them but have the depressing sound added also for a great sounding cd.I was really in a bind on whether or not I should give Play 3 or 4 stars.

" I can see how a CD like this could be a revelation to anyone who is not familiar with ambient music or electronica. Moby has put together a solid block of excellent pieces with 'Play'. Trouble is to a certain extent it's all been done before. Sure it's neat that Moby borrows vocal tracks from diverse sources and fuses them to awesome electronic treatments (not to mention exemplary keyboard and guitar work) but Eno and Byrne did the same thing back in 1982 with 'My Life in the Bush of Ghosts' (which is more interesting and challenging - with far more musical tension - than Moby's 'Play'). Moby's ambient pieces are also great (sometimes sounding like a sort of Eno/Yanni hybrid) but I prefer a tad more 'bas relief' in my musical wallpaper (such as for example the 'Passengers' soundtracks CD featuring Bono & the Edge and - for truly great ambience - Eno's 'Music for Films'). Finally Moby's 'quasi-underground rave rap' numbers are sort of cool but once again you'll find far more interesting hunting for such beasties on Eno's 1992 effort 'Nerve Net' and others like it. In short I was somewhat disappointed that I immediately liked this CD. I prefer to be challenged initially and then over time learn to love a new sounding approach to music. Don't get me wrong - there is some great stuff on this CD. I was just hoping for more. ",3.0
" The reason I bought this album like most people was the single 'South Side' a remix of which (featuring Gwen Stefani) plays on the radio. So listening to 'Play' was somewhat of a shock since South Side is the most rock-based song on the CD and it dosn't have Gwen's voice in it making it sound hollow. I was also taken aback by the lack of lyrical content (which is the main thing I look for in music) but the messages of the music are conveyed through the music -- all the electronic instruments loops and samples come together in an artful arrangement. I'm still not crazy about it but it is really a very good album. ",3.0
" ...I'm always looking for something different to track on my car stereo. My friendly neighborhood record store clerk directed me to this.

Prior to this I've enjoyed Massive Attack Morcheeba Bjork Groove Armada.While Moby has some interesting pieces here I've found the other electronica and DJ type music mentioned above much more to my liking. Not to say Moby's stuff is bad. Let's just say it's cool... When I heard the first track it put to mind those early solo Paul McCartney tracks where he recorded tunes by playing all the instruments and he overdubbed he and Linda on the vocals. Some of Moby's instrumentals remind me of some of Badalamente's work with surrealist David Lynch but you know what? If I want Badalamente I'd buy Badalamente...speaking of another artist with the letters b a d in his name a few of the tracks reminded me also of jamacian multi-instrumentalist and one of my favorite keyboardist Wally Badarou but you know what? If I wanted Badarou I'd buy Badarou.This product of Moby is OK in my opinion. But it's no masterpiece. ",3.0

I personally do not give a scybalum about Moby's personal or political views. He's a gifted artist; so was Kurt Cobain so is Carlos Santana so was Richard Wagner. But I just want to warn you about the nonsense in his liner notes. Waawaawaa... poor moby. We mistreat our prisoners. Yeah if you get put into jail for a DUI or white collar crime and you are brutalized and sodomized that stinks. If you made a mistake and are really trying to get your life together and pay your debt that stinks. We don't mistreat all of our prisoners in fact we treat many of them too well. But don't paint all prisoners and criminals with the same broad brush. Some of them are the most repulsive vermin ever to walk on the planet from terrorists to drug lords to pirates to child rapists and pornographers. Treat them well? What kind of crap values do you really have Moby? Treat someone like the guy who destroyed Polly Klaas well? Terrorists slit the throat of a 3 year old baby last friday night.

" While it does cover a wide range of wildlife the drawings themselves are not very realistic - they represent the animal yes but not accurately enough to really be used as a teaching field guide even for non-magors. It'd probably be ok for younger kids though. There were some magor types of wildlife that I thought should be included that were not (red-tail hawk box turtle) as well as some that I don't know why they're in there (humpback whale viruses). The descriptions were short and included very little as to where the animals were actually found (no idea of range). The plants section was really tiny as well. Needless to say I'm still searching for a field guide to use in my class. ",3.0
" This compact book labeled and formatted as a field guide introduces young naturalists to city wildlife. It ranges widely among organisms in urban areas including many familiar mammals and birds as well as skimming a few bacterium viruses protoctists fungi and plants into the mix. Including these latter life forms reminds readers that there's a lot of life going unnoticed much of it too small to even see right around them. If however kids want to identify wildlife around them the usual reason to get a field guide including wildlife that literally cannot be seen is out of place. This latter issue rubs especially since so many more likely critters; ones that many kids will see around their neighborhoods were not included.Attractive illustrations are offered at one per entry and each entry is described in a few sentences. Don't expect the kinds of details in adult field guides. No information is offered on variations in size and appearance by sexes ages and seasons which can be essential for field identification. Nor are ranges presented. What this really offers is a general introduction to the neglected part of nature outside kids' front doors in an easy-to-browse format. For older independent readers. ",3.0
" I read Peterson First Guide to Urban Wildlife cover to cover since it's quite brief and succinct. It's oddly organized--despite claiming on the back cover that it focuses on the 'things you are most likely to see' it begins with a discussion of microscopic organisms including the common cold virus something everyone is familiar with through experience and yet not at all likely ever to see. The insect section covers many common household pests including 4 different kinds of cockroaches but only 4 butterfly species. The selection seems almost random at times; why include trees at all if there is room for only two and why those two? There are no maps and the information on ranges is often vague. However despite being very familiar with most of the animals and plants included I learned a few new things about some of them--for example that common barnacles are crustaceans not mollusks.Overall this is probably a handy little book for beginners or young people who don't have a lot of opportunity to get far from human habitations. It would make a fine addition to an elementary school library. The writing and illustrations are clear and easy to understand but anyone with much outdoor experience or a desire to learn more about individual species will quickly outgrow it. ",3.0

" Alice McDermott once again proves her best-selling author status in her novel THAT NIGHT. McDermott represents her original style of writing and her different point of view of important issues faced by the youth of today and yesterday. In this novel she expands on a subject that is sometimes overlooked or shoved under the proverbial rug. This subject can be summarized in two words teenage pregnancy. She uses her off-the-wall style of writing to enhance the importance of this subject and yet at the same time show the humorous side of it by portraying the story through the eyes of a child. Alice McDermott's purpose in writing the book That Night was to explore the other side of a teenage pregnancy the side that deals with the emotions and feelings of the teens. She foreshadows the pregnancy by portraying the boyfriend as a hoodlum to begin with so the pregnancy is believable and the relationship between the two teens is credible. Judging from the story McDermott's values are somewhat flexible. She shows the relationship between the two kids as young and immature yet she seems almost as if she condones the pregnancy. McDermott shows a moderately unbiased view towards the subject she writes about by continually shifting the focus to the young child through which the story is told. This act nonchalantly brings about the first person point of view from which she tells the story. McDermott's style is uniquely set apart from any other novel in its class. She jumps from present into past into present again but she doesn't lose the attention of the reader somehow. Her tone is very laid back and conversational yet she still shows her point of view in a very realistic manner. The story of two young teens in a passionate love affair really catches the attention of the reader. McDermott's use of symbolism in using two passionate teens to represent the hot summer nights is extraordinary. McDermott shows the irony of a little girl relating the story of a teen in the middle of a life decision that she although much later will have to face in her future. The diction used by McDermott proved also to be original. She depicts the little girl as being more mature than she really is by relating the deep and intelligent thoughts through the 8 year old. Her diction although original is somewhat unreal. McDermott fails to have the little child converse with anyone and also fails to give her a name. Granted this fact may have some valid reasoning that is hidden among the suspense of the fighting and mystery. McDermott has the plot unravel in an odd sequence which enhances the element of suspense in the novel. She uses intense imagery to display the raw emotion taking place in the novel. Descriptions of the fight are prevalent throughout the novel because the whole plot of the story is based around the one night when everyone's emotions went wild and the explanation of why this happened. I believe that Alice McDermott has her very own style of writing and she has a very effective style of writing. Although I may not always agree with the way she introduced an idea or event I highly regard her opinion and accept that she has reasoning for writing the way she does and introducing things the way she does. Her literary tactics are completely her own and they do an excellent job of making the reader think and contemplate on a new level. Her use of retelling the story through the eyes of an unbiased child is genius. By relating her novel in this means also heightens the innocence factor of the novel. That Night by Alice McDermott confirms this author's ability to bring forth a novel of such character and originality that it can become a best seller. Her other novels also attest to her brilliant writing style however odd it may seem. Making a best sellers list usually requires large amounts of experience but Alice McDermott accomplished this status twice within only a few years of a published career. ",3.0

" I was very looking forward to reading this book because it came highly recommended and because it seemed to be a guide for walking in the footsteps of many dedicated Christians. I am sorry to say that I was a little disappointed. Although many parts of the book are really excellent Ms. Norris spends too much time making commentary instead of just sharing the experience. I really enjoyed when she shared how she was moved by prayer to a point of conversion. And how the experience of the cloister strengthened her sense of self and her marriage. But the chapter on St. Maria Goretti while making a valid point was overkill. Still it is worth the effort through the tedious parts for the nuggets of wisdom which are also to be found there. My recommendation skip over the platitudes and embrace the jewels. ",3.0
" This is one woman's journey sketching her life her troubles and her spiritual salvation through a Benedictine Monastery.

It is just so unnecessary--even if you don't see it as wrong--for this to be found in a book on Christian Spirituality. To me it keeps me from recommending the book to some who might otherwise really benefit from seeing the world through Kathleen Norris' eyes. Which is a real shame. ",3.0
" Book ReviewThe Cloister WalkIn Kathleen Norris' book The Cloister Walk she invites the readers into her life as a Protestant poet feminist married woman who is drawn to the monistic life of the Benedictines. She details the struggles she has with reconciling what she knew as a child with what she is learning today. Kathleen also finds great joy in experiencing life as she does and seems to have no intentions of converting to the Catholic faith; she is happy being Protestant. While Kathleen takes the reader on her journey with her she takes time to fill the reader in on her past so that they can fully appreciate her present.This book was not what I expected when I first chose it specifically from its title. I was expecting a book about someone who is in a cloister and writing about that life but once I understood what the intent of the book was I enjoyed journeying with Kathleen. I also found myself wanting to know what happened in her life once the pages ended. One of the biggest strengths of the book was that it was engaging and kept me interested in Kathleen's life. The book also shed some light on the Benedictine life and left me wanting to know more. In my position at my parish I am often asked about good books. I can easily suggest this one as an option though not as a book to obtain knowledge about the Catholic faith but as a good summer read which I think can often times be very valuable. ",3.0
" THE CLOISTER WALK is a hodgepodge. In part it is a fragmented memoir of a fifty-year-old woman who was a poet and ten years previously after being at loose ends for much of her life had found sanctuary of sorts as an oblate with the Benedictines. In part it is a journal of nine months of experiences at a Benedictine monastery (St. Johns Abbey in Collegeville Minnesota). And in part it is a collection of religious writings some spiritual in nature and some historical. One of my problems with the book is that those different parts or aspects of the book are too jumbled. The book does not cohere; for me it scatters into its 75 or so entries (ranging from one to eighteen pages) like the seeds of a dandelion on a breezy day.If there is one thing that unites the book that is its author. THE CLOISTER WALK is not one of those books in which the author is unobtrusive. Kathleen Norris is on every page and the reader is presented in full measure with her apprehensions and insecurities her joys and epiphanies as well as her preachings. At one point in the book she writes 'I am observing my life more than living it' and that characteristic imparts an introspective intensity that leaves me notwithstanding my admiration for her somewhat uncomfortable. The author who takes the reader on this cloister walk is not a relaxed person and her existential intensity - existential tension even - ends up coloring many of the things she shows and describes.Nonetheless I found many parts of the book rewarding especially the descriptions of contemporary monastic life the discussions of the Psalms and the Book of Revelations and the accounts of assorted religious figures from history such as Mechtild of Magdeburg Mary of Egypt the Virgin Martyrs and Ephrem the Syrian. And while to my way of thinking there is more than a little gibberish - for example the passages on the difficult role of poets and artists in today's world - there also are nuggets worth salting away. Here's one",3.0
" As a woman who worships with both Protestants and Catholics on a regular basis I thought that I would enjoy the perspective of a born and raised Protestant living as an oblate in a Benedictine monastery.I consider myself to be a somewhat literary person although not poetic and found the poet Kathleen Norris to be rather obsessed with language. I also found her to be rather obsessed with some aspects of church history. I learned more than I needed to know about the Virgin Martyrs and St. Maria Goretti. Like some of the other reviewers on this site I was hoping to learn more about life in a monastery. Some of the human interest stories she tells towards the end of the book are moving and make me wish for more. The beautiful examples of holiness and long-suffering on the deathbeds of people she has known meant more to me than hearing about how many wounds Maria Goretti received when she was murdered.In fact I wouldn't suggest that this book be kept by the bedside for nighttime reading because some parts are quite disturbing for reading at anytime but particularly as bedtime spiritual reading.I feel as though Kathleen Norris wondered if she'd ever again write a book and thinking perhaps that this was her last chance--she filled it with all kinds of material from both the past and present. At least one reviewer commented that she wasn't focused--it did seem as though my mind was flying in every direction trying to keep up with her meanderings. Only occasionally did I feel inspired or uplifted. I honestly wonder how relevant some of this material is to the average Christian who just needs a spiritual pick-me-up and a peek inside the monastery walls. ",3.0

" While appreciating what Helen Hunt Jackson was trying to do with Ramona there are some aspects of the book which truly bother me. One can't help but wonder at her glossed over hisoricaly nostaligic view of the mission system in California. The Native Americans who were in this system were kept in virtual bondage and horribly abused both physicaly and sexualy and were forced to give up the lifestyles that they had known. I think Ramona has good intention but like Uncle Tom's Cabin the book it was modeled after suffers from a severe case of historical nostalgia. It is however interesting to read the book from a modern perspective in the sense that reform literature has certanly changeg over the years! A good read just beware of the hisorical inacuracies.

However having said that I found the book a thoroughly enjoyable read...overdramaticized yes but we can forgive it when we consider the original date of publication. However it is the story behind the story that is most interesting. What Ramona truly is....a middle class white woman's perception of what it might be like to be an Indian. Jackson was an abolitionist turned author in the 1830's. This is her most recognized and extensive work. So the next time you read it if you read between the lines you will see HER innate prejudices and assumptions. Butlike I said I enjoyed it immensely and reccomend it as a fun read...but don't take it too literally...it is after all fiction ",3.0
" I actually read a 1908 edition of this book but this was as close as I could find. I found Ramona to be a pretty good story but had trouble understanding why it was said to have been monumental in bringing changes to the government's treatments of Native Americans or why it apparently received such myth like status in certain parts of Southern California. I was raised in or had family in nearly all of the territory mentioned in Ramona (which ranges from San Fransisco all the way down to Mexico). I had never heard mention of the story until a local book dealer here in NC offered me a copy of it. It was only recently that I got around to reading it and I did like how well the book describes all the mountainous terrain I grew up in and miss so much particularly the mention of manzanita trees which are so beautiful but are only indigenous to that area. Also the mention of all the missions particularly the one in San Diego I visited so often was a nice mental vacation back home.Outside of the background I was excited to read this book that was suppose to have been so life changing for the Native American people as half my family falls in that category. Unfortunately I was not struck by anything earth shattering. Jackson does talk about the government's early allowances of whites basically claiming public domain over the natives' homes and lands which was definitely tragic but the true horror of what really happened at that time never really reaches the level it needs to to be moving. You would gain more from reading pure historical accounts or textbooks or visiting native area museums near the reservations. I found Ramona to be more of a love story than anything and even the love story was sweet but again just short of really moving. Ramona herself goes through mental and physical maturity and it was nice to see her grow with each experience throughout the story but her love Alessandro struck me as mostly annoying to be honest. It seemed he spent all of his time in constant outrage whining paranoia melodramatic smoochy love talk with Ramona or just bat crazy. Granted his people had been through some hell but even when things were good for him Alessandro just never struck me as a real man secure in himself and I wondered what Ramona was fawning all over. Even Ramona at one point makes a comment that she jumped to hear Alessandro laugh because it was so rare.I saw one reviewer on another of edition of this book mention that it seemed that Jackson was trying to write how she assumed the Native Americans spoke and acted. That is definitely the impression I got too. Particularly with Alessandro but with many of the Native characters they would either sound White-influenced or Mexican-influenced in their speech and behavior but never really Native American to me. Jackson's 'Indian' dialog reminded me of the way they would make Tonto speak in the old Lone Ranger movies. Not to mention that Natives (at least the men lol) are not so open with their emotions and feelings even with wives. There is a guardedness and stoicism that just wasn't well portrayed here.Like I said Ramona is pretty good to get an idea of the Southern California landscape and there are some great interesting characters - Ramona herself and especially the sassy Aunt Ri (though her deep Appalachian dialect makes for tough reading-at certain parts it goes on for pages!). The love story between Alessandro and Ramona is cute and bittersweet and you do feel for them through their joys and tribulations but overall it just wasn't QUITE as moving as I was hoping for. ",3.0

" Endless Love was an everyday love story about teenage love. Yet it was here that both lead actors got their big break. Well we all know what happened to Brooke Shields. She now stars in her own sitcom Suddenly Susan. As for David who went on to pursue smaller roles such as portraying a reverend-turned-werewolf in Steven King's Silver Bullet you could say that things did not turn out to be quite as well for him. Overall although both actors intended to shoot for the stars their performance can best be described as well...jaded. ",3.0
" Although much maligned this movie isn't that bad. At least I was able to sit all the way through it which I can't say for a lot of more heralded titles. Based on Scott Spencer's novel about teenage love as Pauline Kael has observed it's like the male version of Splendor in the Grass. In Splendor Natalie Wood was so nuts about Warren Beatty that she was packed off to a loony bin. Here Martin Hewett is just as obsessive about Brooke Shields and he's the one who ends up institutionalised. Director Franco Zeffirelli is more interested in presenting the teenagers as modern day Romeo and Juliet and he pulls back on the sex that was rampant in the book. Hewitt and Shields still have sex but it's staged so unerotically that the fact that Shields needs sleeping pills becomes a joke. It can't be that her recreation makes her too hyped to sleep and considering how often they are seen to engage in activity it's a wonder she can stay awake at all. Zefferilli probably equals Spencer's purple-ness in a climactic brawl and with the hysterical performances of Don Murray as Shield's father and Beatrice Straight at Hewitt's mother. As Hewitt's father Richard Kiley is quietly assuming and as Shield's mother Shirley Knight is warm and tender this being one of her last films before she began to gain weight. The 'liberal' household that Knight and Murray share which is meant to be a catalyst for the love that the teenagers are just 'too young to handle' also has odd indications of incest and this prepares us for a later scene where Knight makes a pass at Hewitt. That Hewitt is using Knight to get to her daughter still doesn't seem to shift the shame of an older woman/younger man seduction off Knight and the fact that he had been sleeping with her daughter makes things even more queazy. Thankfully Knight manages to retain her dignity but the point that she is still an attractive woman seems beside the point of Hewitt's rejection. When Hewitt is banned from visiting Shields at her home we wonder why that means he cannot speak to her at school. And when Shields' family have a party we also wonder why Hewitt is not invited. From the glimpses we get of Shields at the party she hardly seems pining for her 'endless love' partner so we are apt to believe the information Hewitt has overheard - that the couple have broken up and the implication being that Shields is again a free agent. These mixed messages culminate in Hewitt confronting Shields and nearly raping her to make her admit she still loves him. Hewitt is required to act more than Shields since his character has more at stake than hers in the narrative and though he falls back on boyish head-lowering and makeup provides him with a masculinising stubble he is convicing when he cries in the rain. Shields however is used like a model. Cinematographer David Watkin captures her at what may be the height of her beauty a standard Shields has been unable to rise above in her adult years. This film also features James Spader in one of his early snooty roles as Shields' brother and a beefy Tom Cruise in one scene. ",3.0

" The plot and the characters are done well and over all I enjoyed it. However this text desperately needs an English editor. The author repeatedly makes errors regarding the English milieu. The most glaring of which is the appearance of skunks in the English countryside and a 10d nail is known only in north America in England despite the attempts of the EU nails are referred to by their inch length. Therefore it should have been a 3'nail that had been wrenched free being the equivalent to 10d.

",3.0
" (2.5/5 stars) No it is not a good film but I have seen much much worse. Drew Barrymore looks gorgeous the ending is truly surprising (for better or for worse) and there is a decent supernatural element to it. I won't rehash the plot because others have already done so; rather I will simply attempt to justify the rating I gave it. The entire film is amateurishly done though I would give it an A for effort if that really mattered. The filmmakers were trying to make a thriller about an extremely mysterious young woman and the movie accomplishes that. Also the energy almost makes up for the lack of talent and quality. However the subtext concerning 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' is an interesting idea better left on the drawing board and the script could have used some tightening. Fans of horror films have grown accustomed to low budgets because films in the genre are rarely taken seriously. After watching films such as this one can understand why. Nonetheless a low budget is not an excuse to produce a low quality film. Filmmakers must work within their budgets and not provide signs that indicate any limitations. Lack of a budget doesn't bother me but the filmmakers must have realized how ridiculous the effects at the end of the movie looked. To be taken more seriously they could have revised the ending to avoid these effects. The fact these effects were left in the movie indicate to me this movie is meant to be fun not earnest. Taken for what it is it really isn't awful. ",3.0

It was also my last one because it didn't live up to my expectations - even though critics reported it was the best German movie ever... Anyway the best part of the moive are the first 2 minutes (the preface). The idea itself is quite exciting but strictly speaking the movie is just 30 minutes long and is repeated over and over again with vario9us scenarios... it get's very boring after a couple of minutes.

The critics weren't kidding when they said it had stunning visuals a pulse pounding soundtrack and a pace only a cheetah could catch up with. Unfortunately it just plays out like an extended MTV music video. The plot starts off interesting and easy enough but the twist and turns all end in such a predictable and almost rushed way. Almost like the director gave up on the last half of the movie. Sure I like the whole 'cause and effect' feel but it could've been polished more. To keep it simple Run Lola Run is a roller coaster ride of a movie with adrenaline pumping speed . Just be forwarned it's not for everybody. ",3.0
" I challenge anyone to fall asleep watching this movie! The combination of the techno-beat soundtrack and Lola running feels like it should be as bad for you as looking directly at strobe lighting. The main idea behind the movie has been done many times before - having the chance to re-live the same day again to reach a different conclusion. The director shows us how coincidence and chance affect outcomes. This isn't a film for realists fans of great dialogue or character development. But if you think you would enjoy watching a movie that grabs you by your senses and shakes you up you could do a lot worse. ",3.0

There's allot of hype about the flick how great the movie is how mind blowing the music is blah blah blah... and with the advice Flavor Flave gave us all about 'the hype' I didn't believe it. Instead I went out and bought it because I was curious. The plot? Girl runs to save boyfriend. That's it. It was like 'Groundhog Day' on ecstasy. I'll give it credit for being original. I'll give it credit for knotting up all the details. I'll give it credit for energy as it had a lot... but in the end I was rather bored with the ending. It kind of fell off. The music house music which you can find in most new age independent films. Watch it in German with the subtitles because the English dub is so over-acted it makes it look ridiculous.

The boyfriend whose life is on the line is a gangster a drug dealer. Why would I care if he lives or dies? So he can poison the youth later on?Overall the DVD is average. There's not many extras but it is a 2-sided DVD that has both widescreen and full-screen versions (for those of you that like to miss 40% of the movie). This movie may worth a watch not much more.

" I read someone else's suggestion that this German film would inspire Hollywood to copy it. It would if it were that original. I have seen this idea done twice already in America. The first was a short film about a man who was unable to avoid repeating the same few moments in his life for an entire day. The documentary-like film had no stars. The next thing I knew Bill Murray was starring in Ground Hogs Day an almost complete replication of the short film I had seen earlier. The short film isn't particularly a comedy the Murray film is.Run Lola Run is not a comedy either. Its a film about a girl who has 20 minutes to save her boyfriend from robbing a store. Manni Lola's boyfriend needs 100000 in 20 minutes to pay his bosses back for money he has left on the subway train. His life will be forfeit if he is unable to pay this money to the men he works for as a courier. Three times Lola runs in order to help her boyfriend. Each time the scenes are largely replicated but there are minor differences in timing. These differences result in major differences in what happens. I'm not going to tell you why the sequence repeats three times or how it comes out.Suffice to say that the film technique here is extreme razzle- dazzle. I don't think there has ever been a German film with this much heavy production and effects. Mostly we see Lola traversing a German city going from one building to another across one scenic plaza after another running at full speed. In each rerunning of 3 very similar scenarios her encounters with people places and objects are just slightly off. The minor changes in time make for major differences in what happens.I have to tell you the film was an obvious formula with too few variations to excite me much. Some might like it. I didn't think it was as much a story as it was a production. I wouldn't recommend it. Its wonderful filmmaking but very poor story-telling. ",3.0
" I don't like to disagree with the friend who lent me the DVD of this movie. I always appreciate the foreign cinema. Since I was stationed in Germany for six years with the U.S. Army and had a few German friends who would occasionally visit me I was always looking for good German-language films. Belonging to a family of people who appreciate films I knew the major classics of the German Expressionist period and the Sternberg-Dietrich collaborations but I needed something newer to keep young German friends interested.Run Lola Run is very showy but it lacks depth. Now I don't disagree with other people who like this movie very much--the last thing I want is for people to think of me as hostile--but needs something to care about--a reason to exist--where the zippy photography and inter-cut animated segments would ultimately mean something. Run Lola Run seems to me to be a very shallow film. Except for this the film was very good. The film is successful at adapting a certain aura of contemporary German society the same side that like many of us Americans watch a lot of daytime television; I only intend a deduction.As always I recommend the following German films",3.0

" Run Lola Run has a very different style of directing - fast motion panning shots intersparsed with dark slow scenes intended to draw out the viewer's emotion. I have to give credit where credit is due and in that regard Run Lola Run is something completely different.In the same breath (and without giving any spoilers) the main premise of the movie is one you won't soon forget.But even with the unique directing style the definitive concept of the story and the good performances by the cast there's something lacking about this film. I couldn't feel the characters I couldn't put myself in their shoes. I couldn't find a reason to feel sad or happy even though there were several scenes where the director's intent was to do just that. The movie lacked depth and emotion.If you're a film student and you want to see a different style of directing see this movie. If you find enjoyment in watching something new plot twists rarely seen before see this movie. But if your enjoyment in movies comes from emotion and passion feeling the characters and experiencing the story with your mind AND your heart this movie isn't for you. ",3.0

" Tom Tykwer`s 'Run Lola Run' is a breath of fresh air. There is so much creativity and vision in this small film that it stands alone against the overblown star vehicles the major studios keep forcing upon us. It is a film brimming with energy and inspiration and a powerful salvo against Hollywood conventionalism.Lola (Franka Potente) is told by her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) that he has lost a bag with 100000 deutsche marks in it. She realizes that he will most likely be killed if the money is not delivered to the gangster Manni was supposed to meet. This realization starts Lola off on a quest to come up with the funds on her own. With time running out Lola bolts out of her apartment and runs . . . and runs . . . and runs . . .'Run Lola Run' is a treatise on the infinite possibilities a single situation can spawn. It is a metaphysical examination of how the choices we make will affect us forever and how the actions of others can profoundly influence the circumstances of our lives. Yet on a more simplistic level it is also an energetic display of filmmaking at its most creative. Its unique use of freeze frames novel camera angles instant replays and animation is proof that Tykwer is determined to give us a viewing experience unlike anything we've ever seen before. With a pulsating soundtrack and a bravura performance by Potente to complement his boundless creativity Tykwer succeeds in creating a truly original work. Here's hoping that his example will inspire the current generation of filmmakers to test their own creative limits in the hopes of surpassing the standard set by 'Run Lola Run.' ",3.0

" It would not be correct to say The Autumn series is a Romero-fan's ultimate zombie series but its not fair to say its 'the thinking man's' zombie series either.If you worked your way through Autumn and its sequel The City you pretty much know what you're getting. Some occassional grisle and gore but mostly a lot of complaining and 'didnt-we-already-go-over-this' dialogue. Still I know I was at least invested enough to see how things turn out. The sadist in me wanted more of the survivors to get mauled by the hordes but the Lost fan in me was interested to see how the ending would develop from here.Most of the most annoying characters have been weeded out by now so you know that you won't get too many 'what's the point' speakers from here on in but you still get your gaggle of quitters and whiners which would be fine if it weren't every other conversation.The scenes at the airport are certainly intense and make for the most thrilling in the series since the farmhouse stand-off on the first book.The Autumn series did just-enough blood/guts/gore to keep me invested the characters were interesting at time annoying at others and Moody's reliance on describing the state of decay on the zombies became less powerful the more and more he did it.

" I have read and reviewed the first 2 'Autumn' books and I am probably sounding like a broken record. There is not enough of the over-the-top Zombie gore that I enjoy so much. There is however more action in this book than the first two in the series.The books are well written and interesting. The problem I have besides the absence of extreme Zombie gore is that the books focus mainly on the characters. The Zombies almost seem secondary to the story.I enjoyed all three books but this was my favorite so far. The suspense is tight throughout almost the entire book. You get a possible explanation of what may have caused most of the world's population to die. The Zombies are more violent than ever and the feeling of despair is at an all time high. Then the mood changes there may be hope!These books wouldn't be my first choice in the Zombie genre but they are entertaining. The story does lure you into wanting to know how it all ends.

" This book will save your life? Were I a book club I'd say instead welcome this author when she cruises your way but don't necessarily trawl the Amazon to find her.Homes has ticked the right boxes on her resume. She attended Iowa Writers' Workshop belongs to Yaddo artists' community and teaches at Columbia University and the New School in New York. Her first novel Jack came at age 19. Her story collection The Safety of Objects inspired Rose Troche's film of 2001.Adopted at birth Homes recently documented the disappointing discovery of her biological parents. Maybe that resolved the personal trauma but what of the national trauma? Twin towers still loom as the pachyderm in the parlour of American fiction the gatecrasher that American writers struggle to overcome.The previous Homes novel dates from 1999. This one distances the setting to Los Angeles. It subverts the unspeakable via the menacing sinkholes wildcats wildfires and earthquakes known to monster that city. It introduces the rich but disconnected Richard Novak jolted by an 'incredible pain' he cannot identify.Show don't tell harp the sages of fiction. On the first two pages Homes tells us twice. 'Everything today is not the same and yet it is exactly the same and can never be the same again.' Followed hard by 'After years of making sure that he is left alone he is suddenly afraid to be alone afraid not to feel not to notice.'Surviving his opening bout of incredible pain Novak rapidly makes the acquaintance of an immigrant doughnut man a helpful quack doctor a 'crying woman in the produce section' a personable movie star who lives up the road and a famous author gone to ground. The 911-emergency operator recognises his voice after the reporting of his incidentally showy good deeds. During which time his semi-estranged New York son is driving closer and closer to Los Angeles.Such a concatenation of threats and disasters among the economically and racially diverse citizens of Los Angeles echoes the disguised feel-good of the Academy-awarded movie Crash. There is in Novak's accidental-tourist wanderings a refreshing undercurrent of making it right a healing serendipity. Once again things tend to be underlined. When our Good Samaritan shames the doctor's waiting room into helping an old lady Homes wills him to lecture the group 'That's the point isn't it?'The endpapers acknowledge another Amy H. long-time Homes supporter Amy Hempel. She is a mordant miniaturist whose seemingly innocuous stories sometimes conceal a black undertow. Meanwhile Homes makes benign observations like 'Driving a Bentley to Target-only in L.A. does this make perfect sense' and 'America has two kinds of politician-one has sex the other has war'.To make something great out of her good material Homes maybe needed to stretch out and suffer more. If not quite up for that level of literary sacrifice and rebirth she does offer something intriguing.(Canberra Times September 9 2006) ",3.0
" Here's the message of A. M. Homes' novel-get your head out of your woo woo and look around. Protagonist Richard Novak represents that unfortunate trend of people who are so impressed with their own self-importance that they have edited nearly everyone out of their lives. Richard has done just that so when he is overwhelmed by mysterious and extraordinary pain there is no one to pick him up from the hospital. Shaken by how he has cut himself off from everyone save those whose services he pays for he sees the importance of change. When he starts to pay attention to someone other than himself things begin to happen.Homes has set her novel in Los Angeles which is an easy shot. Bustling with immigrants from places ranging from Oman to Omaha and subject to a shifting landscape that seems mysterious to outsiders it's an easy place to pick for such crises of being. In fact 'This Book Will Save Your Life' should be made up of harder choices. It's charming it goes down yes easily and its message of open your eyes is a good one. But what of it were set in another city or even a town that doesn't have the built-in joke factor of LA? Richard is so rich and has filled his life with so much macrobiotic kitsch that it is hard to recognize him our regular lives-even in the guy whose cell call is so important that he can't be bothered to greet the barrista at Starbucks.And then once he does try to connect with other people they are an exceptionally colorful crew. No one is as dismissive of him as the old Richard would have been to them. Even the crankiest-the woman he meets sobbing in a supermarket-gives him a chink to get in.This is a warmhearted enjoyable novel but I want to see a darker deeper treatment of how we got to be in this fix.

As Richard (don't call me Dick) Novak goes through his life interacting with a movie star a crying woman a reclusive writer a kidnapped woman and various city functionaries concerning his sinkhole we never find out how he feels about any of the odd events happening to him!When Ben his son enters the story the emotions improve but not to a satisfactory level in my opinion.

" The audio book version of This Book Will Save Your Life (by A.M. Homes) benefits from the fine reading given it by Scott Brick. That Brick manages to give so many eccentric characters a distinctly recognizable tone of voice is in fact remarkable. And because these characters are the best thing the novel has going for it Brick's contribution is particularly important to one's overall perception of the novel.The book opens just as Richard Novak is suffering through a life-changing experience. He is on the phone with a rather blase 911 operator who insists on methodically interviewing him about the pain he his experiencing rather than taking his word that he needs immediate help. The pain so bad that Richard is even unsure precisely where he hurts does ultimately land him in a Los Angeles emergency room. The Richard Novak that emerges from that emergency room will not be the same man who entered it.Prior to his painful reawakening Richard was content with his life of relative ease and isolation. He lived alone working the stock market from his expensive home totally dependent upon the services of a daily housekeeper/cook and personal trainer to keep him going. The problem as he sees it now is that he is close to no one including the teenage son he barely knows.Richard's need to reconnect with humanity will lead him to a series of bizarre experiences involving those he encounters over the next few days.

" I had a hard time growing these. Firstly you're suppose to keep it in the refrigerator to grow however the size of the block of soil they give you is SO BIG that there is no way it would ever fit in our 'frig (also because you need room on top for these to place the plastic hood and they sprout up rather high). It would be good if they sold them in smaller blocks like 1/2 or 1/3 the size so people could accommodate them in their refrigerators. They never really grew properly and always looked sparse and sickly. However to the company's credit they offered to replace it so that shows me they are honest. For that reason I give them 3 stars instead of 2. If they sold these in smaller packages for people with not much room in their fridge then I would give it 4 stars because I am SURE these probably grow much better in the fridge and I would've had better success had I been able to put them there. The smaller package would be easier to grow and a more affordable price (they'd probably even sell more too).

" The story starts out showing how children are left to fend for themselves and try to make adult decisions. A fire is started and kills one of the children showing how no matter what the circumstance a child is left to act like it only knows how to. The counch shell is also introduced and will be a 'telephone' for the children and also a sign of power later in the novel. I wasn't to impressed with the slow developments of the first 2 chapters there was alot of focus put on the children and not enough time spent describing the setting. The characters were highly detailed. Piggy is introduced almost as the adult figure while there is Ralph who is more the neutral party and Jack who is the complete opposite of Piggy. They introduce Simon to be like the conscience figure of the group stating how the only beast on the island was the boys themselves. It seems as though Golding attempts to show us almost a battle of good vs evil though out the book until the final chapter as we see the counch being destroyed and Piggy the only one with intelligence being killed. Ralph dodges numerous attacks through out the end chapters to be saved by a navy officer who comes to the island after seeing the smoke. I would have liked to see something happen at the end to the boys who were part of Jacks tribe or at least see something happen to Jack. The story ends with alot of answered questions in my mind on what happens to the boys having something to show us what later because of the boys would have been very nice. The story was fairly easy reading with some exception to the early chapters. There was a definate lack of interesting material. The later chapter from the point of the beating death of Simon to the last chapter was much more action packed and really does a good job of filling your imagination. I would have given it a higher rating but the slow begin is why I give it 3 stars. ",3.0
" The book Lord of the Flies in my opinion is a very interesting book to read. It is about a group of kids that get stranded on a deserted island. It shows how they survive and get along with each other. I would recomend this book to people that like to read old english and like drama and tension between people. It is a book more for people that can read and understand old english. Other wise it is a pretty good book to read. ",3.0

" Lord of the Flies by Sir William Golding is about a group of boys trapped on an island in the middle of nowhere because their plane crashed. Lord of the Flies described how the kids dealt with life on the island with no adults and no sign of rescue in sight.Lord of the Flies is an interesting book. It has great interaction among the characters especially between Ralph and Jack. Ralph is an athletic kid. He believes in order and building a civilization on the island. That is why Jack and he fight. Jack is a strong-willed kid. He believes that the best way to run the island is just go hunt and turn in the rest of the castaways into savages. Ralph was the original leader of the tribe Jack however did not like how Ralph was leading and he started his own tribe. The two tribes did not get along and that made the story interesting.I enjoyed the way the boys learned to survive on the island by hunting and getting their own food. Jack's tribe hunting the boar down was quite exciting. However I did not enjoy the ending of the book. The story ended too abruptly and almost ruined the book for me. The book also would have been better if it had told more about the happenings. All in all Lord of the Flies was good book but because of the ending was disappointing. That is why I rate it 3 out of 5. ",3.0
" I thought that the book Lord of the Flies a an okay book I would not say that it was the best book that I ever read. The reason that I liked this book was that Golding did a good job of making the book and allegory and he used the characters to show human nature how it can be good but mostly savage. I would think that people that like this book are the people that like to read story for the deep meaning and not have everything told to them and use their imagination when they are reading a story. So overall I thought that Lord of the Flies was an okay book. ",3.0
" I think the book wasn't believable enough to relate it to anyones life. Yes it does have its points about life but all in all it isn't realistic. I think the author's(William Golding) purpose for writing this book was to state the theme that 'there is a need for civilization and rules.' I do agree with him. The book's high points are the events that happen when there is no civilization or rules. Murder theft and violence are all products of no civilization and that is shown in the book. The best literary element in this book is the characters. Golding described his characters to the max. You knew what a character was thinking when he said something or did something. The good characters were so innocent and pure. While on the hand the evil characters were some of the worst people I've ever read about. The reader also loved to hate the evil ones they do things that get on your last nerve. I don't think this book is believable. In the book the children have to deal with events and situations that a thirty year old man would have trouble trying to solve. Children of the age of twelve or younger break into groups because of who stole the toy or the video game not about how they should live or whether or not a childs schedule fits their lifestyle. Bottom line is that the book was good but has it's flaws. ",3.0
" [This is an old review lost in the amazonian jungle now reposted at the request of the Lord of the Gadflies.]The two boys we meet on the first page of 'Lord of the Flies' Ralph and Piggy are as freshly minted as Adam in the Garden or the earth/ice gods of Greek and Norse mythology. Born full-formed they are pre-modern utterly unsurprised by their own existence. They are no more plausible as 12-year-old boys than the usual totemic first humans of 'creation myths' from cultures around the world. Plausibility is not the objective of myth; moral instruction is and 'Lord of the Flies' is plainly intended as a morality tale illustrative of human nature which is depicted as innately savage held in check only by authoritarian social structures and above all by 'rules'.Reading 'Lord of the Flies' as a version of Genesis does make the story clearer though I make no claim that such clarity was William Golding's intention.

" Maybe it's the fact that I am around 40 years old and I should have read it when I was 15 - but I couldn't really connect with the story. By the time it finished I did not really care too much about what happened to each of them - Piggy Ralph Jack or anyone else.I suspect it is the fact that I could not believe the story as a whole - lots of little kids living on a deserted island surviving on fruit.It is quite well written though.

" I've put off reading this book for awhile. No reason really I had heard good things about it that it was full of symbolism etc. So now I've finally gotten around to reading it and while I do admit it was chock full of symbolism I didn't find it particularly engrossing and even a bit dull.After a wreck a group of boys twelve years and younger are stranded on an island. From the first they are eager to make their own society without the yoke of adults while still secretly yearning to be rescued. A boy named Ralph is made head of this society with Jack a leader of a choir group turned hunters as his somewhat second in command. He also has a somewhat adviser dubbed Piggy who owns a pair of glasses that is the main source for creating fire. As the boys live on the island their society starts to deteriorate and fears make the boys do things that no one would have ever thought them capable.Ralph is a weird leader for the group. He seems in the beginning to be more along the same lines of personality as Jack. A bully in a way but really just a normal boy otherwise. Piggy is the typical picked on kid who has aspects of him that are important to share but are ignored by society based on superficial reasoning. And Jack well he's the type that's filling up our prisons or operating under camouflage as a socio-path in the normal world. It's just in this world he is allowed to have the savagery come out. Ralph's experience with leading causes him to miss the socio-pathic role but he could have come very close if he had made a few decisions in a different way. And then there's Simon who's supposed to be the enigma of the group but who's really just a sick little boy that is looked at differently because of his issues.Golding uses this book to show a number of things. The bleakness in society the potential for violence in anyone and that without consequences to rules society could fall apart quite easily. But there were a couple things I didn't understand. For one I never really realized why it was all boys that were stranded on the island especially since they weren't all traveling as part of the group like the choir was. Why did they go to savagery so quickly? Especially when you consider the amount of younger kids. And what about their feelings of home and wanting to get back there? Surely after a week or so the fun of playing on their own island would have abated and a depression would have set in. And that just seems unaccounted for. While I thought Golding made some good points about society and how it works I just think it could have been fleshed out more.And the writing itself. For all the violence and gore I found it dull. Just the style was hard to follow because of the way it jumped about. And while part of that can be attributed to following the actions of young boys it was just jarring to read and made it easy to lose focus. And I know this book could actually be geared to middle school and high school aged children but I wonder if the majority have the ability to really get at all the symbolism in this book or if they'll be so distracted by the gore that it'll be missed. Certainly there are some very intelligent kids out there that will get it but not everyone is like that. Heck I'm an adult and I probably didn't catch half of what Golding put in there.There are some lessons in here but it just wasn't the right platform for me. I didn't like Golding's writing style and it caused me to hurry through a book that should have time spent on it to get at the detail.Lord of the FliesCopyright 1954182 pagesReview by M.

" I read this book in 6th grade as part of an 'advanced' program. I wish I hadn't read it quite that early; I might have enjoyed it more. I found it hard to get past the graphic descriptions of blood and gore and to the meat of the story. I do suggest it however; it seemed like an interesting book. (Being a 6th grade girl I wasn't so into the 'blood and gore more and more' thing.)It does contain some disturbing subject matter so it's probably not for kids. (Mature 8th graders and above would be my recommendation.) All in all though Golding describes what happens when society falls apart very vividly and portrays the savageness of humanity gone wrong very well. ",3.0
" The author's purpose for writing this book is to send a message to the readers. I agree with his message because it informs you of how cruel people can be. I think the literary element the author handled best was the characters. They were very well described by their looks as well as their actions. This book was believable because the way the story was written because it has real personalities as real people. For example when people are in a group they change to fit in just like the characters in the story they all became savages. This book was 'less than perfect' because it didn't have any girls and the ending was not very elaborate either. I would fix the flaws by adding more things like girls to see how they would react and be more elaborate in the ending. If I were to rate this book it would be fair. ",3.0

I agree with the message because when the kids got used to not having a parental figure around they did what they wanted. The element that was handled best was the climax because of how detailed he explained every thing that was going on. This book was very believable because you're always hearing about people getting into plane crashes and they were standed on an island for a long period of time and they had to use a lot of survival skills.The book was less than perfect because in the middle of action Golding jumps to something totally different. I would fix these flaws by continuing until the action is over. All in all this book was an ok book to read. ",3.0

The only thing I disagreed with in the book was that Ralph was the leader. I thought with the help of RalphPiggy would have been the best leader because he was the smartest one in the group. I also think Golding did a good job writing this book. He used alot of themes that are in society todayand made me think what if something like that could happen what would it be like.

" The Lord of the Flies portrays the wicked sinful nature of man. In the beggining of the tale the boys are proper and organized. As it progresses however the boys become blood thirsty murderers. Ralph is the leader of the civilized tribe but later loses control to Jack. Jack's tribe hunts for food and has a fort while Ralph tries to keep a smoke signal alive. Jack's tribe kills two of Ralph's friends and plans to kill Ralph...This book shows the evil nature of man and how it can easily get out of control. ",3.0

" Lord of the flies shows perfectly the dynamics of a group of military schoolboys. Changing as the line of command deteriorates. When they are put on the island after a plane crash. At first they follow reason make a signal fire collect food make shelter so that if there is a storm they will have somewhere to go. The two main powers are Ralph and jack. Ralph seems to the others to be a constricting adult. He pressures them to work and collect fruit tend to the fire instead of running around and playing games on the beach or hunting pigs to eat. Jack is the solution to this he offers a separate tribe to join instead. They paint their faces hide in wait of pigs and develop strategies to track them down. Eventually tempted by the new power most of the boys move over to jacks tribe because they are sick of work and want meat instead of fruit to eat. When there are only a few left with Ralph. Ralph and piggy try to confront the lack of interest in getting rescued also piggy needs his glasses back. There is a scene where piggy gets a rock dropped on him and Ralph fights with jack. As a spear glances off his side Ralph turns and runs to hide in a thick thorn bush the next day when they hunt him. His friends who were forced into the other tribe betray him and before he can be smoked out he breaks their ranks. Later he hides under another bush in a shadow but Rodger finds him. As they chase Ralph shelters are bursting into flame.The ending leaves you hanging you don't really know what is going to happen I didn't really like that though you do get to just make it up yourself. They kill each other. Piggy Simon and one other a boy with a mark on his face goes missing early on. As soon as the navel officer is on the beach they just stop forget that they are all savages or perhaps they remember that killing is wrong and they should have been organized. With the words' what have you been doing?' they all change. Also the torture of am and Eric with spears into joining the tribe and leaving Ralph by himself.The whole book Ralph and Jack are fighting each other this seems to be more of the storyline then the obvious one of boys being stuck on an island and what they do. It Seems that its the fight between their morals and hope on being rescued. Ralph gets his hope from piggy and Jack to help ease the pain of never being rescued starts the tribe of hunters. Then he can take out his pain on tracking the pigs and learning the art of hunting.Lastly Simon talking to a pigs head is just plain weird and i can understand why they take it out of the book for the movie except that this is the only reason that the book is called lord of the flies.

" Again another book tagged as an 'enduring classic' is to be blunt a disspointment and at many times a horrible bore. I myself do not really appreciate the writing stlye of Golding. It seemed to me all of his quotes ended like this-- This was very frustrating to read giving me the feeling more was to be said but was never written often bringing me off track while i was reading trying to wonder what the character was trying to say and i would realize i had read a page or 2 and had not the slightest clue of what i read. Another problem that i found within this book was the sheer number of unimportant characters the continually are mentioned. Characters with no background or character development are often named making me feel as though i missed something again taking me off track of my reading. Overall the story itself has an interesting idea in my opinion this interesting story is quite frankly ruined by the poor quality of Golding's writing. A frustrating read filled with obscure as well as obvious symbollism I would not recommend it. ",3.0

" William Golding's 'Lord of the Flies' is about a group of young children stranded on an uninhabited island who are forced to create their own civilization and survive. The novel while somewhat predictable and easy to understand is filled with many important uses of symbolism. In the opening Piggy finds a conch shell and uses it to bring order to the group and the conch shell continues to symbolize order throughout the novel. However when Piggy is killed later on in the novel the conch shell is destroyed also symbolizing the end of order. The 'Lord of the Flies' a severed pig's head symbolizes the cruelty and brutality that the members of Jack's group possess. Throughout the novel there are many parallels that are made between the boy's civilization on the island and civilization as a whole. This novel is easy to read right through and not fully understand its entire purpose but I believe William Golding's purpose for this novel is to provide an understanding of the evils of civilization and government.

The story is so great; it shows how nature and man can combine together and accomplish good or evil. Golding brings these kids on this island where they will have to face many challenges and fight with life and death.He brings mankind and civilization together and makes the island like a war against nature. My opinion is when he creates the plots and description of the story he describes the characters and the island and the plots so well. I like how he makes the story like giving us a sigh of the world we live in today on how the world can be so cruel and evil but the outcome of it can be very good. Overall this was a very great book.

" Golding's purpose for writing this story was he meant to send a message out to the readers. He wanted to let us know what it would be like to be free without rules and authority. I think Golding handled setting and symbolism best out of all the literary elements in the book. He described the island so good it makes you visualize what it looks like. Golding also used lots of symbolism helping to explain why certain things happened in the story. Golding wanted to show how young boys would react to being alone and in charge of themselves.

" Lord of the Flies is brilliant of that there is no doubt. It's painfully realistic and I have no doubt that events on Golding's little fictional Pacific island could have unfolded exactly the way he led them to unfold.

" The book 'Lord of the Flies' is a very interesting book. This book has it ups and downs. I think that the only way that you would be able to enjoy this book is if you start thinking deeper into the story. I liked this book because you can think deeper into it and it makes sense and it explains a lot. If you think deeper into the story then you can enjoy the book so much more.This book is pretty much a allegory book. An allegory is a story or tale with two or more levels of meaning-a literal and a symbolic meaning. The characters in the book stand for something else. This is a hard book to understand for that reason. Once you thin it through and think of what the characters could be resembling then you can understand the book more. I didnt understand the book until my teacher started telling the class that the characters stand for something or the symbolize something and then I understood it and got into it a lot more.So if you are looking for a book where it gets you to think and it has a deeper meaning then this is the book for you. If not the I dont think that this book is for you. ",3.0
" When I fisrt heard of the story and of the ideabehind this book I thought it could really be agreat novel. The main idea is to propose a metaphor of what our societies are like but from the point of view of children lost on a desert island. They 'build' their own little society with a chief and people who have to do some tasks if they want to survive. Well the setting sounds really cool doesn't it?That's why I wanted to read this book and I was not compelled to read it by one of my teachers. But when I finished it I was very disappointed. The basic idea is great but the way it is developed is flawed. You just have kids who go crzay and wild because there are no more adults above them to tell them what to do or not. And moreover when trying to show us a bit of what is our history and an insight into the development of our civilizations Golding forget many very important things along the way.As a matter of fact there are no women on the island (or well no little girl to fall in love with). And thus no Queen to fight for. Another example ",3.0
" Lord of the Flies is a captivating story about human nature. A group of young boys left alone on an island must work together to stay alive and possibly be rescued. At first they are successful but in the end they fail miserably. The group splits into savage vs. civil and things get crazy. Although I wouldn't consider this book one of my favorites I liked the way the boys' struggle represents real struggles that go on in the world. There are many themes in this book and in general the book mirrors human nature and the realities of our civilization today. In the end everyone in the book did what made them happy even if it didn't work for the group. Our world today is much like this people are mostly concerned about themselves. There are many conflicts in this book between leaders and followers order and chaos work and play. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes action and conflict.

" This book has been widely discussed and read regarded as classic and worth of a Nobel Prize for William Golding. For some reason I had my reserves about it I do with most 'classics' but I decided to read it anyway. Even though is haunting and beautifully written; I was left with the feeling that this was just a novel of kids stranded on a desert island that could have been much better. And most of the critic to human nature and society is just a lot of hype. ",3.0
" this is a book that will be enjoyed on many levels. it has something for everyone. younger readers will enjoy the fantasy and instant action that the story delivers from page 1. older readers will consider the various 'morals' and how it portrays a micro-version of the degradation of society. although at times the book can be a bit difficult to follow <especially for younger readers> i believe that their perseverance in reading the book will pay off largely at the conclusion of the tale.

" Lord of the flies was a fairly good book. It is about a group of boys who land on a desserted island after their plane has crashed. No adults had survived the plane wreck so the kids are without any adult supervision. Throughout the book the children learn to survive on their own by hunting pigs and building shelters with Ralph as their leader. But they cannot all get along and when Jack starts his own hunting tribe the group of boys split. The boys in Jack's group always wanting to hunt quickly turn into fierce savages. So fierce that others are endangered of being killed. After most of the boys join Jack's tribe Ralph and only a few other boys are left to try to get themselves and the others recued.This is an event filled book with a lot of action always taking place. I recomend ti anyone who is looking for a good book. ",3.0

" I'm aware that this book is a classic and is very popular but it just didn't do it for me. Maybe I am too much of an optimist but I really can't see a group of boys turning into killing machines that quickly just because they are trapped on an island. Fighting of course; stabbing and attacking not so much. Like I said maybe I just think to highly of people but this book just seemed so unrealistic to me that it lost all of the chilling effect that it is supposed to evoke. However it was a fun read and I really liked the ending. ",3.0
" Better than the last book I read but a bit too innocent for it to speak to us today. It didn't age well. I think we need far more to shock us today and so much of the significance is lost. A great book in its time and context no doubt. ",3.0
" English 9In Lord of the Flies the Author William golding shows characters have astruggle for existence. He uses third-person omniscient. The narrator speaksin the third-person primarily focusing on Rrallph's point of view but followingJack and Simon in certain episodes. The narrator is erudite and gives usaceess to the characters inside character's thoughts. Author's uses shortsimple and grammatical sentence structure. He uses interesting vocabulary butnot a large vocabulary.Golding express Civilization vs. Savagery the instinct to live by rules actpeacefully follow moral commands and value the good of the group againstthe instinct to gratify one's immediate desires act violently to obtain supremacyover others and enforce one's will. And Loss of Innocence As the boys on theisland progress from well-behaved orderly children longing for rescue to cruelbloodthirsty hunters. They lose the sense of innocence that they possessed atthe beginning of the novel. In the camping out or collective there are exactlyhave a leader. So under the government come into being governmentorganization of it self. I can recommend about students should read it. BecauseIt has complex title but easy to understand more than government education. ",3.0
" I thought that Lord of the Flies was an average book. At times it was really exciting but at other times I found myself just looking at the words instead of reading them. It took me a while to get into the book. I would recommend this book if you are into books that make you think but if you're not a thinker then I wouldn't recommend it. ",3.0
" Lord of the Flies is about the human nature. It's extremely complicated and deep which makes it some what hard to understand unless you analize every part of the story. I didn't like it because I'm too young to really understand a lot about human nature and the characters annoyed me. Through the whole book I wanted them to do things so they could be saved but the majority of them didn't care. ",3.0
" I recommend this book for high school students who enjoy to read. It is a good book for a person who likes a little bit of adventure and some excitement. The one thing I did not like about this book is it does get dull during the middle of the book but it picks up a little bit in the end. It should be a book that you would want to read instead of being forced too. ",3.0
" I'm a student who was just required to read Lord of the Flies. I personally thought the plot was good. I liked the charaters in the book. I think though that maybe the author has a similar problem in writing to myself. I know I get a good idea and cannot write it down the way I want it. I'm sure the original idea was a great one. Maybe if I reread this book at a later time in my life I may be able to like it better. I'm not sure. Over all I'd tell you to read it because its a book about survival from the elements from oneself and contains a large amount of action within its pages. ",3.0
" this novel was extremely intersting and had great symbolism. great choice!! ",3.0
" I think the author was trying to tell us that everyone has some kind of evil inside them. I agree with him because everyone isn't perfect. The best literary element in the book was the characters. I like how each character had its own great personality.It was a believable because without rules crazy things like that can happen. The book could of be better if the begining was so slow and had more action in it. Overall i really liked the book. ",3.0
" Lord of the flies was a book about a group of kids that plain crashes on an island and they get stuck their.The kids have no grownups around so they have to do everything for themslves.They try to establish rules but after a while nobody listens to the rules and all hell breaks out. I think the authors purpose for writing the book was to show how people can turn savage in a short period of time without anyone to enforce the rules.I do agree with his message because society's do need rules or else things like what happened in the book will happen every day. In the book I think that the author handled the characters very well.There were many charactersand he described them and their personality very well.I think Golding is a great author. This book is very believable to me because a plane could crash on a deserted island and kids could have to take care of themselves with no grownups around.It all is possible. I think that Golding did a great job with this book and it is fine how it is written. ",3.0
" The novel The Lord of the Flies by William Golding is a novel in which some boys get stranded on an island and they are trying to find their way off the island. To read this book and completly usnderstand this novel you should and almost have to be a very intellectual person and you have to be a deep person. There is some symbolism that is very difficult to understand and without a teacher or someone who understands the book telling you what it is about it could be very confusing. The book however had very good discription and was very well written. It made you feel like you were actually there with them and feeling their struggles and difficulties. I felt their frustration with each other. Can you imagine if you were stranded on this island and you had no adults no parents and no sense of government? I felt as if the book was never ending and it dragged on way too long. I didn't enjoy reading it therefore I really didn't put a lot of energy trying to figure out what the author was trying to say. I also am not a girl for ficton books and I usually don't like books that we have to read in school. If I were to read this book I would deffenitly go in with a different mind set. I would go in with the mind set that this book is very difficult to read and that I have to foucs a lot to see the hidden symbolism and theme within the book. I enjoyed the scenery that was set up and the discription used to describe events. I recommend this book to anyone who has great understanding finding hidden symbolism and picking out the theme. Be prepared for a some what difficult novel yet thrilling. Be intense while reading this book! ",3.0
" The book Lord of the Flies written by William Golding is a very well written book. The genre of the book is historical fiction. The setting of the book is on an uncharted island during the WorldWarII era. The book is mainly about a couple of schoolboys who crash-landed on an uncharted island that they are stranded on without any adults. I think the theme of the book was to show that society cannot run correctly because of the natural sinful nature of man. Some of the main characters are Piggy Ralph and Jack. Piggy and Ralph first meet when they when they wake up next to each other after the landing. Piggy is a chubby little bossy kid while Ralph on the other hand is a mellow and relaxed cool kind of kid. They call together all of the kids that are on the island including a boy named Jack. Jack is a stuck up kid who is a prefect at his school and is the captain of his choir class. While the short lived bond of Piggy and Ralph's friendship becomes weaker Jack and Ralph who are both leaders seem to get along very well. Piggy and Ralph were friends but when a person like Jack shows up a more strong leader-like and Ralph-like kid is up to be Ralph's friend Ralph quickly ignores Piggy to become Jack's friend. But as Jack and Ralph's friendship grows the contest for leadership of the tribe of kids grows even more. Even though the kids already voted for Ralph to be the chief Jack is starting to show that he could be a better chief. I believe this because all Ralph has ever cared for is to keep the fire going and keep the hope of being rescued alive. While Jack a more ferocious boy focuses on staying alive most of the time and hunting for the hard to get meat. I think that this book is best recommended for older teenagers because most of the words in the book are very complex and because of the violence that happens. The book Lord of the Flies is a very interesting book. Even though it has some very confusing words and hard to understand material it should be given a try. ",3.0
" I read Lord of the Flies one time for school. When I first started reading it I didn't like it that much but I thought it wasn't too bad. Some parts were really interesting but some were boring. I thought it really started to get my attention towards the end when a lot of interesting things started to happen but I didn't really like the first half. If you didn't have to read this when you were in school I would recommend giving it a try. But I suggest to read it all the way through to get the full enjoyment of it though. ",3.0
" Lord of the Flies is a story about sverel young boys who were stranded on an island with no adults. The story tells about how they developed leaders and routine for their lives. It was a well written book although sometimes it was hard to follow. Some portions were a bit disturbing but it kept me entertained and that takes a lot. I'd say this book is like Peter Pan meets Cast Away. It was a wonderful story on adventure and survival. ",3.0
" I didn't know anything about LOTF before I read it except that it was foundational to many other works controversial and highly recommended. As far as a story goes it's engaging. The characters aren't anything special from a literary perspective. I'm not a big person on reading into the symbolism behind everything in a book so much of the appeal and social critique of LOTF was lost on me. Some parts were confusing and I'm still trying to figure out why the title is what it is (the pig head on the pole seemed like a minor incident).At the end I was left with a feeling of 'meh.' But that's just me. If you want fun and adventure you're probably best to look elsewhere. If you want to read a critique of human nature and the fall of society you've got it. If you haven't read this 'classic' and need to check it off your list enjoy. ",3.0
" When I started reading this book I was happy to look for adventure of a bunch of young kids/men stranded on an island without any support or knowledge of survival instincts. Then the story takes a turn by showing how human behavior creates anger jealousy and hunger for control. The key of the book is how do people react when left to survive without controls governments aka survival in nature.The writing style is smart vivid and exceptionally detailed. The author describes every movement colour geography and person in detail.The plan is simple- put kids from various backgrounds in order to get a bag full of characters possible.Read this to realise how we end up behaving when there is no control and the dark side our human mind is capable off ",3.0
" In my seventh grade English class we have just finished reading a great book called Lord of the Flies by William Golding. He wrote this book with unbelievable description which would either catch your eye or put you to sleep in class. For me it was more like putting myself to sleep. That doesn't mean it wasn't a good book I just think it was in my opinion a book more for adults. Besides the description the plot was well written. I enjoyed how he used Piggy to get the theme across.Mr. Golding put lots of thought into the book when writing description. From describing the ocean blue all the way to describing Piggy's looks and attitudes. Examples of this can be found throughout the book literally there is no page without description. A description on a tree could even go on for 3 pages. Personally that was what lost my interest. An example I found was on page 169 where it says 'The twins watched anxiously and Piggy sat expressionless behind the luminous wall of his myopia.' This shoes both the scenery and Piggy's attitude which is stubborn. This shows his stubbornness because the author says he was sitting expressionless which is usually what I do when I'm frustrated. Another good description Golding had was on page 158 where it says 'The air was heavy with unspoken knowledge.' This is showing the tension between Piggy and the other people on the island who are not listening to him.I enjoyed how he used Piggy to get the theme across because of the way he left Piggy there just open. I can compare Piggy to an unlocked door that people just walk by they will never know what they have just missed. That is what happened to Piggy they didn't expect anything from him just because of his obesity and judged him just by that which is plain wrong. Just because it is wrong many people do it in present day it must just be a natural judgment. But really Piggy is a smart kid. In my opinion I believe that they would have gotten off the island if they just let Piggy be leader or at least do more work. In my opinion the theme was 'Use what you have don't make assumptions and you always have something.' That is the first thing they did when they saw Piggy make fun of him. They let that fly past their heads and assumed he wouldn't help. Really he was their key to success and knowledge. They always had him there but just left him hanging.So if you are thinking about buying this book or not I would say go ahead. Anyways the most you have to lose is a few dollars. Maybe if you don't like description then just don't even bother but if you adore description then defiantly try this book. You will finish it and realize that book really wasn't that bad after all.

" The author's purpose for writing this book is to send a message to the readers. I agree with his message because it informs you of how cruel people can be. I think the literary element the author handled best was the characters. They were very well described by their looks as well as their actions. This book was believable because the way the story was written because it has real personalities as real people. For example when people are in a group they change to fit in just like the characters in the story they all became savages. This book was 'less than perfect' because it didn't have any girls and the ending was not very elaborate either. I would fix the flaws by adding more things like girls to see how they would react and be more elaborate in the ending. If I were to rate this book it would be fair. ",3.0

" 'Lord of the Flies' is displayed as a remarkable novel. The plot shows suspense adventure and thrills. As the novel slowly uncovers itself each of the character's inside personality also slowly reveals. The novel shows the extent of action humans would take for survival and the wide and vague diverse personalities different people contain within.Once the reader picks up the book they would be enthralled in the novel and would feel trapped within. The words are used so intensely that the reader will often feel as if they are part of the story. This novel is beautifully written and the plot is presented in a unique manner.'Lord of the Flies' is a rather tragic and frightening novel. The protagonist goes through never-ending adventures for the hope of survival. The antagonist does whatever it takes to get rid of the protagonist and would go far beyond imagination. Even though the protagonist was a static character unfortunately the antagonist is thought to be a dynamic character that turns evil through a twist of fate. ",3.0
" Lord of the Flies is an imaginative novel that I recommend to all patient readers. I believe in this novel like others I have read published in this period has a slow paced plot that does not have incredible amounts of action. In this book it is sometimes necessary to read two chapters before something exciting accure. For this reason I feel the book may leave something to be desired among the new generation of readers. However I feel that William Golding does a great job of creating the beautiful yet traitorous terrain and characters on the island. Overall this book deserves its crown as one of the best books of its type in the 20th Century. ",3.0
" Lord of the flies is a book based on survival--the strong overcoming the weak. A bunch of boys crash into a deserted island and slowly become very primitive. When Jack separates the boys into two different tribes they transform from civil to barbaric. The two groups begin to turn on one another. Farther into the book the fighting increases and the tribes really start to break away from one another.The point of this book is that mankind thinks that their society is civilized but it is still very primitive. The world today is still based on survival; the strong overcome the weak. Even now one angry word and our society becomes barbaric. Sometimes wars start and friendships end just by saying the wrong words. As each day passes the boys start to destroy one another. Simple words between some of the boys end up agitating the tribes and battles ensue.The Toronto School Board banned this classic from all its schools citing that it was racist for use of the word 'niggers.' As I was looking at all the banned books I noticed how many are banned for their language. I understand some of this language is harsh but that is how society acts. These words help to express the anger the tribes are feeling. Without these words the reader will never fully understand the hatred between the tribes. ",3.0
" Lord of the Flies is a very deep and symbolic novel perhaps too much of one to really be entertaining. While i did enjoy the basic storyline Lord of the Flies was written in a way that i found extremely confusing and basically uninteresting. The parts of it that i acctually understood weren't so bad though.In the start of the novel a lot of young boys find themselves trapped on an island with no adults. In the first few days that they are there they elect a leader set up rules and get an organized camp going. They seem to be used to having rules and regualtions and no one objects to this. There are some important main characters in this book. Ralph is the civilized rational figure who is elected cheif in the beginning. He knows what needs to be done to get rescued and throuout the book he is focused on that. Then there is Jack who turns out to be the 'bad guy'. He wants to be the cheif and he really isn't interested in doing productive things he wants to hunt instead. Piggy is the wise figure in this novel. His ideas always are the obviously correct thing to do but because he is somewhat of a nerd no one really listens to him and most of what he says is shot down.Throuought this book civilization goes down the drain. Jack eventually breaks off from the rest of the group with his hunters and soon enough all the boys except for the little ones Piggy and Ralph join his tribe to feast dance and have fun.The conch the shell that symbolized organization and power in the start of the novel is smashed into thousands of pieces which shows us that the morals and society of the boys has completely died. The beast which all the boys are afraid of symbolizes the fear that we all have of the unknown. It seemed that every word in Lord of the Flies had some deep hidden meaning which i felt made the book tedious and confusing. Yes it is a good book but would i read it again? No. ",3.0

" This book is an important book of what happens in a society when there are no rules or any guide lines to follow. Ever since the boys were placed on the island they were destined to fail at creating their own perfect environment. The setting they are in starts out as a good fun environment to them but by all of the boys hunger for power it turns them against eachother and turns this so called 'good' island into a 'bad' island.Jack is a representation of evil by how he thirsts for blood and meat as a opposed to being rescued. He would let the fire go out which is their only chance for survival just to cut open a pig. Ralph represents good by trying to create order shelter and a way to be rescued. Jacks group takes over the island creating the human motivation for evil and hunting. Ralph being the only one left his motivation is forced into surviving as opposed to creating order. The whole island turns to chaos when just one person takes control. This person represents the devil figure and he takes down everyone on the whole island except for Ralph. This book shows how important rules and order are in a society today. It also shows how human motivation can completely take over the whole human body and let barbaric things happen that would not happen in a normal oderly society today. ",3.0
" Lord of the Flies is a very enjoyable book. It is a book that you would enjoy reading if you like analyzing day-to-day life in your litature. The way Golding makes the boys on the island symbolize people and actions in the real world is what makes the book so good. I origianly thought the book was gooing to be boring and hard to catch on to but after I got into the book I wanted to know more about the characters and what was going to happen next. If you dont like putting yourself into your reading then you would not like this book. The plot in this story is always changing because right when you thilnk something predictable is going to happen golding puts a spin on how they characters act or what their next action is going to be. Overall I thought Lord of the Flies is a good book. ",3.0

They choose Ralph as their leader and Ralph appoints Jack to be in charge of food.Ralph Jack and another boy Simon  set off on an expedition to explore the island. When they return Ralph says that they should light a signal fire to attract the attention of passing ships. The boys ignite some dead wood by reflecting sunlight through the lenses of Piggy's eyeglasses. The boys are playing rather than monitoring the fire and the fir engulf the forest. One of the youngest boys in the group disappears during the fire never returning presumably having burned to death.One day a ship passes and Ralph and Piggy notice that the signals fire which had been the hunters' responsibility to maintain has burned out. Furious Ralph accosts Jack but the hunter has just returned with his first kill. Piggy criticizes Jack who hits Piggy across the face. Ralph blows the conch shell and scolds the boys in a speech intended to restore order. At the meeting it quickly becomes clear that some of the boys have started to become afraid. The littlest boys known as the littluns have had nightmares from the beginning and more and more boys now believe that there is some sort of beast or monster on the island. The older boys try to convince the others at the meeting to think rationally asking where such a monster could possibly hide during the daytime. One of the littluns suggests that it hides in the sea. Not long after the meeting some military planes battle high above the island. The boys asleep below do not notice the flashing lights and explosions in the clouds. A parachutist drifts down on the mountain. Sam and Eric are responsible for watching the fire at night they are asleep and do not see the parachutist land. When the twins wake up they see the enormous shadow of his parachute and hear the strange flapping noises it makes. Thinking the island beast is at hand they rush back to the camp in terror. Jack and Ralph travel up the mountain.. The group holds a meeting at which Jack and Ralph tell the others of the sighting. Jack says that Ralph is a coward and that he should be removed from office but the other boys refuse to vote Ralph out of power. Jack angrily runs away down the beach calling all the hunters to join him. Ralph rallies the remaining boys to build a new signal fire this time on the beach rather than on the mountain. They obey but before they have finished most of them have slipped away to join Jack.Jack declares himself the leader of the new tribe of hunters and organizes a hunt of a pig a violent slaughter followed by sowing the head to a stick as a offering to the beast. Later encountering the bloody fly-covered head Simon has a terrible vision during which it seems to him that the head is speaking. The voice says that Simon will never escape him for he exists within all men. Simon faints. When he wakes up he goes to the mountain where he sees the dead parachutist. Understanding then that the beast does not exist. Simon travels to the beach to tell the others what he has seen. But the others are in the middle of a chaotic revelry when they see Simon's shadowy figure emerge from the jungle they fall upon him and kill him with their bare hands and teeth.Ralph hides for the rest of the night and the following day while the others hunt him like an animal.. Ralph collapses in exhaustion after being chased out of the forest but when he looks up he sees a British naval officer standing over him. The officer's ship noticed the fire raging in the jungle. The other boys reach the beach and stop in their tracks at the sight of the officer. Amazed at the spectacle of this group the officer asks Ralph to explain. Ralph is overwhelmed by the knowledge that he is safe but thinking about what has happened on the island he begins to weep. The other boys begin to sob as well.I enjoyed reading this book it was very interesting and had a lot of action in it. I liked how the ending began with the plane going down and the boys being stranded on the island. Another favorite part of the book was towards the end when all the boys break up and they are fighting. Overall this was a good book to read and I would recommend it to anyone. ",3.0

It is an action/adventure book about a group who suffer a horrific plane crash and the boys are stranded on an island during the World War II era. The tale involves the struggle of power between two boys. Ralph is just your average male just looking for law and order. Jack on the other hand is a constant slave to power.Just imagine what boys would do when stranded by themselves. One thing they do is paint their faces and turn into savages. The book brings you on a journey of boys trying to survive or will they just be boys and play forgetting about the fight for survival?Golding shows us that everything has a good and evil side. The book does have its twists and turns and some things will surprise you. Despite all of the entertainment I felt this book was very predictable. What else could you get in a story about people stranded on an island? This does not necessarily mean it is not a good book though. I guess you can only judge it by reading it for your self. ",3.0
" With no parents teachers or rules is there really any question as to why the characters in Lord of the Flies by William Golding had no mercy? The story is about a group of English boys on their way to boarding school when their plane gets shot down in the middle of World War II and end up stranded on an island. They try to form a society and govern themselves but not long after the boys are having chaos for breakfast and anarchy for lunch. The book reminds me of the movie Thirteen only the male version. In Thirteen the main character goes to shocking lengths to befriend the most popular girl in school. Before her mother knows it she is powerless to rescue her daughter from a whirlwind of drugs sex and crime). They both I find are not shocking at all. This is the way people today are to say you were shocked is saying your living your life blind. Ralph is your typical guy in high school who is unsure of himself and just watches the bully pick on the little kid. Jack on the other hand is the jock/bully who everyone 'admires' whether it is in fear or respect. Simon is the artsy type. He is out of the box and in his won world. Piggy a very intelligent boy would be your 'nerd' who stands up for what he believes in. The Lord of the Flies is a well written book full of truth. When you read the story don't be disgusted. Ask yourself 'what would I do if I were twelve years old and stranded on an island?' ",3.0
" I read Lord of the Flies knowing it's a classic and for the most part I thought it was pretty good. It details the story of young boys stranded on an island after a plane crash. At first the primary character of the novel Ralph heads the dictatorship that begins but as time passes Ralph comes to blow with Jack. Where Ralph sees the boys' primary concern being signaling a passing ship for help Jack is concerned with hunting. So two groups emerge with Ralph and Jack as the leaders. After that some very dramatic and interesting happenings take place as the reader sees savagery and visciousness develop amongst the boys.The only real problem I had with the story was the lack of explanation about the boys. The novel starts after the plane crash has taken place and the author never offers an explanation for who these boys are or where they were going. Also I found it somewhat unrealistic the way in which the boys seemed to get along so well on their own. They didn't seem nearly as frightened as I'd imagine boys would be in their place in reality.Overall I say this book is worth reading if you're interested. It's not too long and has a pretty good story. ",3.0
" Now before I start let me just say that this book is not a bad book just an overrated oneThis is an O.K although it bored me when i read it in High School I wondered why we just couldn't have read 'Return of the Native' or something better I don't know why it is on required reading lists nor why it was made into two movies. I guess when you pick apart every syllable and say it means something profound then it does. As for a plot that means anything or charecters that make the slightest bit of sense well lets just forget that.At best you have a harrowing tale about kids being trapped on an island losing their identify here the become a mycocausum for different types of society. At least that's what they tell you on the back cover... ",3.0
" I read this book in high school and didn't like it at first because it was a little tough for me and the attempts to get off the island seemed to drag on to the point where I no longer cared if they got off the island at all but then I read it again and seemed to like it. It was a favorite for most of the students in my class so I decided to give the novel another try and I'm glad I did...I read this book a second time very quickly as I was intrigued by everything that went on in LOTF and I learned a valuable lesson in that if you don't come together in a time of need you will suffer and also that we sometimes fear what will happen and fear to help others so we are classified as 'beasts' I found something valuable the second time I read this novel rather than the first go around...Do read this book..I think you will enjoy it and get a lot from it.

" In my opinion Golding's reasons for writing this book are to show that there is an inner beast in everyone. I agree with his message because there is a point in everyone's day or life that their true beast comes out. The best literary elements that Golding uses were foreshadowing and symbolism. He uses symbolism the best in the way he used Piggy's glasses to reveal a sign of vision. Not just eye-sight but the sight of seeing things clearly. Piggy was the only one on the island that had a clear vision of life and he was also able to see that rules are needed in life for things to work out and for there not to be any serious conflicts. L.O.F. is a very realistic book because if any number of people were stranded on an island without any rules there would be absolute chaos. People would be power hungry like Jack. There would be a few people that thought that rules were neccessary to survive like Piggy.They would eventually turn into worrying about themselves and getting only what they need to survive in life. I think the book could have had a better ending. A reader from LBHS (Long Branch High School)! ",3.0
" Golding's purpose for writing Lord Of The Flies was to show mankind at its worst and how human nature can go wrong. Golding's message was that there is evil inside of us all. Golding is correct in this manner but I thing that everyone has good in them too. In Golding's Lord of the Flies he handled the characters the best. The characters were all well developed and each one represented a different aspect of human nature",3.0
" I think that the author's purpose for writing this book was to tell how to survive in the world/forest without adult supervision. I agree because the boys would have needed to learn how to survive without supervision sooner or later in their lifetime. In this book I think that the author used climax best because it got extremely intense as it got closer to the end of the book. I liked the intenseness in the book a lot. This book was believable to me. It was believable because the events that took place really could have happened. The only thing that could not have taken place was that an airplane was attacked than crashed and no adults survived any of it. I also think that the book was less than perfect. It was good writing and good reading. I rate this book fair. ",3.0
" Listening to this novel doesn't improve it. You get the added bonus track of Golding groaning on and on and on about how he got the inspiration for this overly simplistic morality tale. With so much good literature out in the world if the house catches fire leave this one behind. Sucks to my as-mar. ",3.0
" The book Lord of the Flies is a story about a group of kids getting stranded on a deserted island and how they survive without adults. I didn't like the way that many of the kids went crazy. I know you are stranded on a deserted island but i don't believe that you would just go crazy like that. I know that being on an island like that would probably make you alittle crazy but not enough to brutally kill two of your peers. They all knew that in order to be survive they needed to maintain order. I don't believe they would just betray their elected leader just to have some fun. As for the characters I like Ralph. He handled himself well in the situtation. I did his best to maintain as much order as he could. You could tell that Ralph was had the potential for a good leader. Jack on the other hand I did't like. At first he seemed like he was a nice kid but then he turned on Ralph and formed his own tribe. I couldn't believe when kids actually followed him. Then he got everyone to turn on Ralph who was just trying to keep order on the island. At one point Ralph gives in to Jack and goes to have a feast with him. They then kill Simon because they thought it was the monster running down the beach. Jack just made things out of control with his new tribe. He turned everyone into killers. I like Piggy for one reason because he was the only one to stay with Ralph. This eventually got him killed but he was loyal to the leader that he elected. Beside that he was that great of a character. He seemed like he would get on your nerves after awhile. Thats mainly the reason I didn't like his character that much. The ending of the book was horrible. I was expecting something more to happen than for them to just get rescued. That is the main reason i didn't like this book ",3.0

" Briefly for those of you that don't know Lord of the Flies is a book about a group of boys who are stranded on an island. At first they get along but as the book progresses they fight and kill each other.Well this was a book I had to read for school. I felt that chapters 1-7 were boring 8-10 were okay and 11 and 12 were boring. It had some exciting moments but it had many times more boring moments. There was really no one to root for no good guy you cared to see to live until the end. In other words I couldn't have cared less if they all died. There is a whole lot of symbolism. Actually I am going to have to cut this review short 'caue I have to work on notes about the allusions in it. Its due tommorow ( uh-oh ).Anyway if you are the type of person who enjoys sitting around reading boring books this book is for you!Oh- oops. I just read the rules. This nice little review couldn't ever qualify for a prize. I guess I should explain where Golding went wrong. Well I thought that at points it kind of rambled on. As I said before there wasn't anyone that you really could root for. I think that if Golding had created some sort of wonderful character that was nice to everyone heroic smart not afraid then you would want to turn the pages to see if they would leave. Well now I really got to go and work on those notes! ",3.0
" Imagine you are trapped on an island with a group of boys. What do you do? How do you survive?William Golding's novel 'Lord of the Flies' was written in 1954. It is an action/adventure book about a group who suffer a horrific plane crash and the boys are stranded on an island. It takes place during the World War II era. The tale involves the struggle of power between two boys. One who's name is Ralph is just your average male just looking for law and order. Jack on the other hand is a constant slave to power.Just imagine what boys would do when stranded by themselves. One thing they do is paint their faces savagely kill pigs through their anuses and turn into savages. The book brings you on a journey of boys trying to survive or will they just be boys and play forgetting about the fight for survival.This book is very symbolic in meaning that everything has a good and evil side.

" Willam Goldings novel The Lord Of The Flies is a a intresting deep novel. It touches on alot of levels about society and how we act as people. The novel is about a group of young boys from Britain who are on a plane on their way to boarding school when it gets shot down and crashes on a island. There are four main characters Ralph who is the leader Piggy who is the smart one Jack the strong agressive one And Simon the naturalist relgious one. Through these boys you see the diffrent facets of society and how they are suppose to interact. During the time they spend on the island the rules of a civilized society start to fade away and brings out the primal instaincts in our human nature due to survial of the fittest.. I belive that this is a great novel to read and it displays the ideas of what would happen if societys rules were taken away and how we would function. Using children in stead of adults is also a great idea for it shows that even innocents can turn into savage beasts. ",3.0
" William Goldings Lord of the Flies is a thrill-seeking book. When reading Lord of the flies you will sit at the edge of your chair with the boys that try to fight for survival as their insanity takes over them. Roger Ralph Piggy Jack and Simon the boarding school boys who have just crash-landed on this island; with no parental guidance no rules and now have to learn how to get along with each other in order to get off. As Ralph and Jack battle it out for who will be leader one wants things to be in control and the other thrives to be in control of the others that are stranded too. Just as one-boy stumbles upon a beast we wonder just what could happen next. This is surely a remarkable book for boys to read if they are adventurous them selves. Over SEVEN MILLION copies were sold this book was such a realistic book I could see why. As you read this book you won't put it down because when the unknown of others on an island has you stranded together you must work your hardest to survive you will learn who will and who won't...... would you survive reading this book?

" Okay so this book is recommended. Exciting but boring at times. The beginning was very boring and it stayed that way until pretty far into the book. The excitement level went up and down after the beginning. (The end was very exciting.) (Spoiler alert!) The book ended very suddenly. That was a flaw that really bothered me. (End of spoiler!) This book was very intense towards the end. The kids are a little bit dumb. Except for a few of them.(No offense.) But it had great impact on the excitement so I can not call that a flaw. (Even though I was about to a second ago.) This book is pretty good. Check it out! ",3.0

" Lord of the Flies by William Golding was a great book that took some time to develop. I at first thought that this book would not keep my attention. As I read on I became more and more interested in this book. The idea of having a group of children varying in age stranded on an island was very fascinating. I didn't know how they would react to this situation they were placed in and that's part of the reason this book kept my interest.At first the kids thought it was fun not having any adult supervision. The boys agree to work together with Ralph trying to maintain order by assigning various chores such as keeping a signal fire going that they started with piggy's glasses and gathering food. However the chores stop being done and their society breaks down. This reaches its peak when Ralph sees a ship in the distance and the signal fire is out. The hunting boys were supposed to keep it going and before Ralph can scold them they come back with a kill. This turns the kid's loyalty toward Jack. I thought this was the most interesting part of this book. I enjoyed how it showed the struggle in society between order and lack of it. As jack gains power among the boys Ralph finds himself suddenly being hunted by his former friends. These kids turned savages show no remorse when they kill one of their own with there bare hands and teeth. I found it very compelling how these civilized kids can suddenly deliberately want to kill one of there former friends. However the reason I gave this book a three out of five was the ending. There was great action throughout the book and then it suddenly ends just by Ralph running out of the jungle to see a British Naval Officer.This books characters exemplify three distinct aspects of human nature. Jack shows mans roots in his primitive behavior. He opts to hunt and be free shirking the duties that could ultimately rescue him. Ralph's character shows the desire of man to be civilized yet be free and wild as well. He wants to be rescued but at other times is intrigued by the hunt and wild side of human nature. He shows his desire to be rescued by trying to keep order and have chores. Oppositely he is overwhelmed by the hunt and ultimately kills his friend in the fatal attack on the beach. Finally Piggy is on the opposite spectrum from Jack. He is constantly reminding the others of the proper way to act and mentions adult's behavior as an example. These characters represent the constant struggles that live inside mankind in everyday life.In conclusion this was a great book to read. The plot was exciting with the exception of the mundane ending. It is a book that can be read on many levels and with characters that represent struggles that continuously plague the human mind. I gave this book a three out of five and would recommend others to check it out. ",3.0
" The main thing that people rave about this book is its SYMBOLISM. Well I think that symbolism is based on your own opinion. We don't know that the author meant to have this particular thing represent this particular idea. When you get to the story itself the first four chapters and the last four chapters are worth a read. However everything in between I found to be very boring and you find yourself having to stop and re-read certain things because you forget what is happening; there is no action to help keep you up to speed.Just FYI I didn't have to read this book for school. I read it in my spare time. From what I understand those who must read it for school have a far lower opinion of this novel but I don't know that for a fact. ",3.0
" The Lord of the Flies begins in complete chaos. A group of young boys are stranded on a tropical island after their military school plane was shot down. All the adults onboard were killed so the boys were completely alone. Even without the supervision and direction of parents to help them the boys try to get organized. The pick a leader establish a set of 'laws' for the island and make plans for their survival.Throughout the book there is one boy who is rediculed at every chance and only one boy tries to defend him. There is a constant battle for power between the boys named Ralph who is sensible and only concerned with getting rescued and the boy called Jack who is a savage and only thinks of hunting pigs and having fun. After heated arguments that split the boys in two raids by the hunters that destroy Ralph's shelter and his only chance of making fire and the murder of two boys by Jack's tribe the battle escalates to a the whole island going up in flames while the hunters try to flush out their prey... Ralph.Golding uses a lot of desciption to make you feel as though this could actually happen. He creates a realistic microcosm (a little 'world' that represents a bigger world) with a government and a trouble-maker that shows what humans resort to in times of desperation. The climax of the book is a good surprise but it ends too quickly without enough explaination to understand it easily. I enjoyed the story but Golding repeats things too much and I didn't even like those parts when I read them the first time. Jack talks about hunting too much Ralph talks about keeping the fire going too much and I hate the song the hunters sing. It repeats killing the beast and spilling its blood over and over and they sing it all the time. Without these annoying repeats and the short boring periods spred throughout the book I would say that the Lord of the Flies is a great story (but it is not written like one.) ",3.0
" Getting right into the story William Golding has a good plot in the book 'Lord Of The Flies' but some how knew to how to make me unpatient. The story starts on an island where a plane crash of young British boys had occured. The sorty takes the reader through the horrors of how these boys had to work together to survive and what struggles they went through with each other. William Golding did a good job of showing how much different people are and what different goals people have. 'Loard Of The Flies' was a quick read for me yet it still made me impatient because the charactures kept repeating themselves. Ralf a leader in the book would always say 'we need to keep the fire going.' Jack another leader would always say 'we need to hunt.' Sure the book needed to state this so we could get to know the characters but we didn't need to read these quotes every five minutes This book was very similar to 'Animal Farm' except it used people instead of animals. I saw lots of similarites in the two books and how power can get into the wrong hands. Some people like to abuse their powers and these two books show that really well. I think people who like to read about government would like this book because it relates to how a country is ran. Willam Golding did a good job of using description in which he described every little detail whether it was a person the island or what the boys were doing. 'The Bushes crashed ahead of them. Boys flung themsleves wildly from the pig track and scrabbled in the creepersscreaming.' This is just one of the many quotes where William Golding uses vivid details. I have been trying to add more details to my stories ",3.0

" After more than half a century William Golding's first novel still has the power to chill the blood with its cautionary tale of the degeneration of a group of castaway schoolboys into the depths of animal savagery. However as a criticism of more optimistic boys' adventure stories as a critique of democracy or as anything much beyond a warning of the obvious that young children especially young boys must be carefully civilized (and continually re-civilized) it's a failure... because Mr. Golding cheats. Though Mr. Golding would no doubt claim (with justification) that boy's adventure authors tended to stack the deck in favor of their protagonists Mr. Golding does the opposite. His characters never had a chance. A comparison specifically with R. M. Ballantyne'sThe Coral Island referred to in the novel and generally with other boys' own adventures should suffice to prove the point.AGE",3.0
" This book is more of an insight into Mr. Golding's view of humanity than it is an insight into humanity itself. Needless to say Mr. Golding has a very negative view of people. Perhaps his view is colored by the fact that he lived through the development and dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan (atomic bombs are brought up in the book as having hit the airport from where the boy's plane departed) and the rise of Nazism in Germany. Mr. Golding uses a group of plane wreaked boys to tell his tale of what he thinks is the natural denigration of society. Still I can't find his view at all consistent with the world around us. If savagery was natural for people we would not have developed into a civilized society. In fact with few exceptions all peoples form structured societies that impart rules for the welfare of the group; not the other way around as Mr. Golding would have us believe. Except for few notable exceptions (like Nazi Germany) savagery is not natural for people. Even there civilized peoples prevailed. Additionally I believe this book has racist overtones in that Mr. Golding chooses to use the jungle motif to display his version of savagery. Why couldn't he use another back drop?Technically good writing gets the book three stars. ",3.0

" The 'Lord of the Flies' is an incredible journey that follows a group of boys stranded on an island after a plane crash. All the parents on the plane have died so this big group of boys has to fend for themselves. A big part of this story is about how the boys still create rules to govern the island. A leader comes around named Ralph who has continuous argumments with Jack the oldest who himelf wants to be in charge.Things start off well but sitings of a beast on the island scare many. One of the boys named Piggy a very intelligent but not liked boy has great ideas and tries to get everyone to listen to Ralph and do what he says. One thing Ralph is big on is keeping a rescue fire going. Jack makes a group of hunters to get meat and when their out hunting the fire goes out as a plane flew by but couldn't tell anyone was there because there was no smoke.Ralph and Jack get into a huge argument that ends up seperating the boys into a group of rebelious hunters lead by Jack and the other group with Piggy and Jack. Jack's group has all but Piggy and jack. Gruesome and odd ending chapters see the end of some as the hunters kill them. The leadership and rules set on this island fall apart and shows how rules can diminish is a second and things can turn ugly fast. This book was a very good one to read it had a an ending that leaves you thinking and a story that makes you think about your own life and a great story about these boys on an island who have to fend for themselves create rules and watch things diminish and change drastically after disagreements and a fight for power take place on this island. I reccomend this book to anyone who is looking fo a fun and interesting story to read that has a great ending that leaves you thinking about what's next. ",3.0
" Personally I didn't completely like Lord of the Flies but I still give it thumbs up for the outstanding plot. It began rather slow and dull and continued that way until about three- quarters of the way. I believed too much symbolism and much unnecessary high levels of vocabulary were used throughout Lord of the Flies. Considering this book is required to be read in the English classes of most high school students I believed it should have connected to us in a more straightforward manner as in contrast to a symbolic way as it did. Furthermore when I begin to read a novel I am usually brought in or attracted by the beginning of the book so I can keep interest in it. If I had not been required to read Lord of the Flies I would have almost certainly stopped to read it due to the lack of enticement and hooks in the novel.Towards the end of Lord of the Flies is where the book began to get interesting and truly began to hook me into reading more and even reading ahead of the class. Even though it gets good in the end if you look at it from another point of view things begin to get a bit out of perspective and maybe out of reality. That's when you must realize that these kids have been stranded on an island for an incredible amount of time and things can sometimes get out of control; you'll have to read the book to find out exactly what happens. Even though I didn't personally like Lord of the Flies I still believe every sophomore should be required to read it due to the great storyline and I also believe it is different from most novels but in a good way.

" Upon his return from World War II William Golding wrote the book Lord of the Flies demonstrating how the war had altered his view of humanity and the evil it was capable of. Borrowed extensively from R. M. Ballantyne's The Coral Island Lord of the Flies is set on an island that acts a microcosm of WWII. The school boys demonstrate what Golding believes will happen should man be unleashed into the wild with no society to monitor his actions what will happen when man gets in touch with the primitive evil inside him. Using supposedly innocent children to enact this tragedy Golding makes his message even more daunting and thought-evoking.In the midst of war a plane evacuating a group of school boys from Britain is shot down over a deserted island far off course. The story follows the boys' attempts to survive and to be rescued. It follows their process of electing a leader the battle between Ralph and Jack and the island's descent into chaos. This novel is pretty intense. The allegorical struggle between good and evil is suggested in the title of the novel. The title is said to be a reference to the Hebrew name Beelzebub (literally 'Lord of Flies') a name sometimes used as a synonym for Satan.The story which seems to be another survival story keeps its readers engaged with the tension contained in the calm yet eerie narration. The mystery laced yet seemingly uneventful opening of the novel immediately captures the attention of readers and holds them in a sort of frustrating suspense as they wonder about the meaning and significance behind the introduction. As the story develops and the island is enveloped in madness the reader wonders in horror at the savagery such young and supposedly innocent children are capable of. Without any sense of morality and other societal influences children are the perfect subjects in this examination of true human nature.The syntactical structure and the abundant imagery truly make Lord of the Flies a graphic and daunting read. Variations in syntax between long continuous lines and choppy rhythmic sentences help readers visualize and relate to the situation in the book. Be it the pounding nervousness as their camp is invaded by children gone wild or the frightening image of the 'lord of the flies' each scene is intensified by the author's mastery of language. It helps a reader further delve into Golding's microcosm of humanity as the boys' descent into savagery threatens our faith in the good of humanity.Despite the magnificence of its message and the remarkable skill with which this novel is crafted I definitely do not count Lord of the Flies as amongst one of my favorite books. I personally felt that Golding was far too pessimistic in his view of humanity. While the story does serve was a frightful caution sign it does not reflect the whole of humanity. Golding seems to have been greatly affected by his experience in WWII. It is true that war brings out the worst in people but it is also true that war and savagery do not define our existence. Perhaps I am simply far too optimistic but I feel that just as there is innate evil in the world so is there innate good. That is why the struggle between good and evil is a ever present theme in both literature and life.Lord of the Flies is a great read if its allegorical message is taken with caution. Its deeply developed characters add complexity to this mind shaking story. The suspenseful plot in addition to Golding's eerie narration makes Lord of the Flies a novel that will leave you shivering. All in all it is worth the read. That is unless you'd rather go for something less philosophical and more simplistic. ",3.0
" Although the story of the book was decent and the symbolism very complex I did not really agree with the message of the book and found its theme unrealistic. I don't think that the situation would collapse into anarchy but instead primitive government such as in the beginning of the book.The desires of the boys to 'just have fun' were very unrealistic and counter-intuitive. For example not one person outside of Ralph and Piggy truly care about getting off the island. No one misses their family and it is not even mentioned. There is no discussion of the boys' background except for the fact that they are English and nobody ever thinks about it. It is completely unrealistic to ignore the fact that in the real world the first priority of the boys would be to try and escape and go back to the civilized world.Secondly the overwhelming desire for meat which is supposed to symbolize the savagery in humans is highly exaggerated. The fruit on the island is plentiful and there are many resources. The boys never have any problem getting food and realistically would not engage in such frivolous hunting for meat.I also found the characterization extremely flat. The characters are just faceless names on the page outside of Raplh Piggy Jack and Simon. ",3.0
" First off I really want to state how dissapointed I am that I did not enjoy Lord of The Flies more. The concept is one of the best in the history of literature",3.0
" In this microcosmic society created by the mind of Golding things got too ridiculous too quick. First all the boys crash on this deserted island after being shot down by a bomber. Within a few days they burnt down half the island killing a boy and broke up into groups with a killing machine and a democratic leader. Needless to say they start by killing the weakest and last killing the smartest. The only problem with this is that they are only twelve year old boys who at the very least could have a civil war within a matter of days.I think Golding had a great point of what a society would do to itself and he showed the power children had which was in fact just a minor display in comparison to the great civil wars within our own countries. The only deal with this is that it wasn't very believable. Aside from that he perfectly displayed his point. He portrayed every character as a crucial member of society. You have Ralph who's the democratic leader believing in order Jack who was the dictator or person that believed in his own way Piggy the smart one who had all the right ideas and Simon who was the more spiritual one who rather would do his own thing and believed in helping others and looking out for the smaller weaker children. You could see this in each person and connect in some way because Golding always displayed them doing the very things you saw them out for. At any rate I would at least say read it. ",3.0
" The book 'Lord of the flies' starts out with a group of Brittish boys that are stranded on an uninhabited island. Things start out great and the boys assign eachother jobs and responcibilities. The leader of the tribe is a boy named Ralph. But soon the boys become to interested in hunting and Jack (another boy in the tribe) decides to start his own tribe. Ralph is ok with this move because he thinks that Jack will come back to the group soon. But Jack doesn't ever come back to the group and ends up killing Simon (a member of Ralph's group). Jack's tribe is becoming violent and very savage- like. When Ralph confronts Jack's group about restoring peace and finding ways to get off the island another member of Ralph's group gets killed (a boy named Piggy). Now Jack's group wants to get Ralph out of the picture and try to kill him but right before they are going to do him in a Navel officer comes onto the island and stops the madness.I belive that the theme of this novel is evilness in chidren. This is the main because it is stated throughout the entire story. Golding shows and belives that children are born with evil and society makes us nice and polite. Golding also symbolizes this concept in many ways. One of these major symbols is Jack. Jack is relitively nice at first but as the story progressives and more chaos and fear is developed he becomes more agressive and evil. Another symbol is Piggy. Piggy was the symbol of intellagence and knowledge. When he was killed it was Golding's way of saying that without rules and guildlines evil will always conquere good. After reading the book I could say that I realy enjoyed the book and it got me thinking about what life is realy about. ",3.0
" I find it difficult to fully express my opinions about this book which I finished last night. On the one hand it was extremely exciting and fast paced in its general plot and description and this made it fun to read. On the other hand it was full of dark ominous foreboding and at times downright terrifying symbolism. I am normally not a big fan of excessive symbolism and this book had more than I had ever encountered. This alone would not make me dislike a book though. I found myself genuinely loathing the savages and this while it drew me into the book also made me hate reading it. I coulnd't shake the feeling that something terrible was going to happen and when it did the feeling didn't go away. All things considered I certainly feel that this book is superbly written and does a wonderful job of conveying its message. However I coulnd't stand the fact that the message was basically that humans are inherently evil. I couldn't disagree more and while I may be labeled a deluded optimist I can't bring myself to believe that some schoolboys on a desert island would end up killing each other. I found the thought most disturbing and depressing and that was my overall impression of the book.All in all this was a wonderfully done book with a clearly conveyed message and I am glad that I read it. However I disagreed with the message and found the book to be quite disturbing. My review couln't be much more mixed up could it? I would suggest that you read this book but be prepared to be shocked and detested. ",3.0
" I read some of this book in high school but read it in its entirety recently to see how I felt about it as a 32-year-old adult. I enjoyed it somewhat.It is a good plot concept in general with lots of opportunity for analysis and psychological scrutiny. However oftentimes I had a difficult time believing that the characters were children because they seemed to behave a little too adult for their age. The writing was a bit verbose for my tastes although not excessively so. Because of this it didn't suck me into it's world entirely and it wasn't something that I was very enthusiastic about finishing except to find out how it ends.Overall this is worth reading if you have any curiosity about it but it may take some determination to get through it.

" This book falls into the category of books that claim that a few mental exercises can make Einsteins out of all of us that the Einsteins and Newtons of the world are not that much different than the rest of us. While I don't agree with this belief I do believe that mental ability can be improved through exercises and I found many of the exercises to be interesting and helpful. I had a problem with the author's demonstration of how these exercises can help the reader. In the introduction the author has the reader read a section of text and then she introduces a 'Brain Power Doubler' for the reader to use while reading a second section of text. The 'Brain Power Doubler' is supposed to allow the reader to read the second section of text in less time than the first section of text even though the two sections are supposed to have the same number of words. When I went back and checked the number of words in both sections I found several times as many words in the first section than in the second section which had more to do with the time differences than the exercise.

" This is a review of the STERLING/PEARSON DVD 'Bob Hope Film Collection' edition (with the green cover!)

Lamour is ravishing whilst Hope and Crosby wise-crack and soft-shoe with the best of 'em. All in all a four star movie.However this DVD has a rather pathetic amount of extras (ie. none) a fair-to-middling print and a very low audio track. My suggestion is to find another DVD edition.

You see this '80s remake of the 1950-something [ahem] 'classic' is really just a ridiculous b-movie with fancy special effects.The plot is almost as absurd as the title following what appears to be a colossal alien jelly as it rampages through an American town munching on its inhabitants and generally being a bit of a nuisance. Cue face melting blood spurting and lots and lots of gore.The acting is as cheesy as everything else in the movie and the very idea of a psychotic blob murdering people is somewhat laughable but as i already mentioned this is an entertaining Saturday night horror film.

" Once upon a time in 1958 a little horror gem was made it was titled 'The Blob' now the this blob wasn't like any other blob oh no sir this blob was mean and liked to eat people with its nasty gelatin..Ok enough cute talk let's get to the movie.This remake of the original 50's classic makes the best effort to re-invent the story of a meteorite that carries a deadly alien life form...or so it seems. This time around we have Shawnee Smith as the lead protagonist (best known from Saw franchise) her role in this film is as great as it is in the saw movies she presents a typical teenager but with a little bit of attitude. Along are other forgotten 80's stars.I have to admit that the plot may be in certain ways similar to that of the original but the Chuck Russell (Director) brings new gimmicks and frights to what you may think can be your typical cheesy horror flick. I myself was surprised by some of the moments were I jumped in the movie. The effects are also impressive even though by today's standards they are outdated there are still are alot of impressive mechanical effects that are not seen much nowadays.Personally this is a rare remake that's superior to the original. It's almost up to par with David Cronenberg's The Fly. I personally would buy it its slick funny and of course slimy lol.MY PERSONAL RATING",3.0

Christopher Lambert rides around on a horse and struts around in armor while some unknown terror stalks around the basement of a castle.

" If you are a rabid fan of ye olde epic Beowulf and are dying to see it adapted to film then this is probably not for you. I recommend The 13th Warrior instead. Actually I recommend The 13th Warrior to any fan of medieval action or fantasy adventure. My endorsement of Beowulf doesn't go NEARLY as far and yet somehow in spite of its many glaring flaws I find this 'adaptation' quite entertaining.This straight-to-video year 2000 take on the ancient tale stars Christopher Lambert as the superhuman hero Beowulf except this isn't the Dark Ages. Instead the events take place in a post-apocalyptic future of gears and steaming pipes (a setting that I feel was a mistake). It has Hrothgar the 'Border Lord' Grendel and Grendel's mother but everything else from the poem is absent and here the similarities begin to wane. As movies go this is Fortress meets Mortal Kombat (both of which starred Lambert) meets Mad Max and thrown somewhere in the middle of this techno-gothic realm is Beowulf. Beowulf himself has become a high-flying martial artist (thanks to Lambert's stand-in naturally); Grendel's mother has become a sexy porn star succubus who seduces Hrothgar in his dreams; and Grendel is your typical B-movie creature with some purple haze surrounding him at all times to make the costume seem more imposing (and point of fact it does make the man in a monster suit beastie seem less like what it actually is).Not unlike the old fantasy flick The Sword and the Sorcerer Beowulf still manages to be fun in spite of its many failings and sometimes laughable production values (not to mention laughable acting). I still haven't managed to grasp how it can equal more than the sum of its parts but if you don't expect a film version of the old epic and instead expect a second-rate Lambert action flick you might have fun also.

" I have read most of shakespeare's works but this one I haven't yet. For this movie that can only be a pre. Anyone who even considers any link with the original writing will be appalled by this movie. But anyone with the intelligence to read Shakespeare would be able to see in advance that this one movie has indeed nothing to do with the literature and also would be able to open their mind enough.And if you do that there is a chance (especially if you are a not too stupid man with still too much testosterone in his blood) you may like it. The vision behind it is a erotic melting pot of weird gothic romance unintentionally funny acrobatic fighting diverse (funny) acting archievements and a lot more. Basicly I think it was the director's wet dream version of Beowulf and as that it is abolutely fantastic.The modern technology in a basicly gothic setting has its appeal definately. The bodybag is totally rediculous and so is the speaker. But the costumes are often very cool. Sell all your clicheed fake immitation Matrix outfits this is the way to go. I am still looking for the top of the princess to give to my girlfriend. But seriously the costumes were one of the few things worth watching.For the monsters the CGI department used some tricky ways to make what basicly looks bad have enough appeal although I agree that the monsters are probably the least scary element of the movie. The mother in the end looked very awkward expecting something like in Species this new body of the mother looks very unpractical to me but in some way sexy as is the most important element of this movie. The editing of the shots of here is terrible beyond believe but there was probably not very much to begin with anyway it is easy to see the whole new look of the mother was only done in CGI and for the real action they only used images of the face with some make up and a few props truly B-movie style...As an actor Christopher Lambert is theoreticly a good choice to portray the character in the story. However in reality his performance is not toitally the way we would expect. Moments of more than wooden acting intervened by moments where it looks like he couldn't manage to keep a straight face and stop having fun about where the hell he ended up as an actor are all over the movie.The sexual fantasies about a Shakespeare play cannot be complete with a a certain amount of sexy women. The Princess as I mentioned gets all of the attention by her already mentioned outfit but if you as a man find time to watch her face you may find moments of acting beyond what to expect from this movie. The monster's mother goes even way further actually she is almost a parody of herself here.So what we see here is a movie made with a vision no mather what kind of vision or whose vision a universe is created. Attempts to do something like that always receive recognition. I wish I could get a chance to turn one of men's literary masterpieces in an almost mindless [...] of style and vision with a slightly erotic flavour it must have been great fun for the crew to work on this.As a viewer you first should really consider what this is and hopefully this review helps on that. This kind of movie indeed deserves a few loyal followers (probably the people who also love Starship Troopers) and masses of people left hating. I myself will definately see this movie again some time not that I love it. But it is inspriational in an artistic way and just entertaining to watch. ",3.0

" A very different style to this version. If you ever saw Fellini movies you might compare them to something he did to the Roman stories. I kind of liked it and although cheesy as Robert Law indicated it's worth a rental or maybe even a purchase if you like different approaches to classic stories. Christopher Lambert looks pretty good still and he has one heck of a stuntman doing somersaults and other tricks to beef up the sword fight scenes. They all have some unusual weapons to add to the hundred plus bloody ways to kill someone in this movie. Did I mention the method used to take people's heads off looks like a giant straight razor? Yeah and the castle looks like a fire belching refinery on steroids or is it Ozzy Osborne's home on amphetamines? Is there a difference you ask? Anyway it's a hoot if are willing to be open minded because the costumes look like something they bought at a Cyndi Lauper garage sale.

It is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be in my opinion but that's just me. It is catchy... Although it is pretty weird.11.) Sunday Part I - 2.5/5This is Cibo Matto's attempt at a normal rap song. It is very forgettable like 'King Of Silence'. I do like that it leads into the next track though.12.) Sunday Part II - 3/5This song has emotion but it isn't that great of a song. Don't be fooled with the 'Part II' it's nothing like the last track. They're just both about Sunday.13.) Stone - 4/5This song is a really good song. It is filled with emotions. The lyrics are short but they speak a lot in my opinion. One of the better songs on the song.14.)

" this band has always confounded me a bit. they seem to be good musicians and Yuka Honda apparently is a big name around the new york scene but these Cibo Matto records just do not hold up over time. one of their biggest pitfalls is that they can't decide if they want to be serious or just take the piss and be silly. sure it's cool to do both but when you've got an absolutely stunningly great song on here like 'Stone' on the same album with the cringeworthy 'Lint of Love'...it's just not right. something's gotta give. are you a pop band or a novelty act? it's frustrating because their are some real moments of great pop genius here ( 'Moonchild' 'Sunday Part II') and then horrifying mistakes ( 'Sci-fi Wasabi' 'Blue Train'). well...take it how you want it i guess. it could have been so much more. this band has been gone for some time now but we'll always have 'Know Your Chicken.' heehee ",3.0
" Don't be misled by the other review on here that says this is 'mainstream R&B' and that the album is somehow consciously 'commercial.' Ridiculous. However I can understand the dissatisfied position that that reviewer was coming from. On first listen (which is all I have to go on) Stereotype A seems less exciting or creative than the first album. It sounds like the girls in Cibo Matto really enjoy playing with a full band but the results just aren't as remarkable as the more eclectic sampler-driven stuff on their first album. Practically every song has a laid-back lounge vibe reminiscent of Beck songs like New Pollution and beautiful singing -- which might grow on me but my first impression of this album is that it's well-crafted and 'mature' but sadly this seems to equal boring.

" For women with fuller busts this bra is great...but only for a little while. The company recently switched to metal clasps on all except the black to hold the straps because they were getting too many complaints about the plastic ones breaking...which happened to me at work.

" I purchased this bra during a few months in which I was temporarily off of birth control due to needing to renew but waiting for the insurance from the new job to kick in. I was experiencing extreme breast tenderness during ovulation and menstruation to the point that I would go to the bathroom at work and cut the wires out of my nice expensive bras. I decided to purchase a wireless bra for those days so that I could experience some semblance of comfort.When the bra arrived I tried it on and it fit. It supported fairly well. I love that the straps lock into place and don't slide longer as it's worn. However it bears a terrible resemblance to the bullet bras of my grandma's era which is not a look that I prefer. I also have terrible problems with wireless bras not giving me enough separation causing my breasts to touch sweat and chafe regardless of weather/climate control conditions however most of this can be solved by applying deodorant or baby powder. The strap padding is more annoying than effective as it slides around and constantly needs adjustment. If there were a way to hook or fasten it into place that would be ideal.I do like that there are four columns of hooks as the standard three tend to stretch out far to quickly for my taste leading to me taking in the sides or back of my bras - I prefer the bands tight for if I don't have ample support my back lets me know in very unpleasant terms. This bra however does not feel like it will be stretching out at any point in the near future as the fabric has very little elastic.This has been designated to be an at-home-only bra due to the shape and I doubt I'll ever wear it in public. I'm to the point of not caring about seams or trim showing through my top provided the bra does its job of making my boobs round lifted and front and center however this fails on all but lifted. It's perfect if I'm sick cleaning or lounging or if I'll be going somewhere that evening in constrictive undergarments but prefer to be comfortable until it's necessary to change.If the shaper were better I may consider purchasing this bra again however as it is I will not be purchasing another one as I have found an alternate comfy bra that doesn't mis-shape me terribly.

I work at home and was looking for a less expensive option than my go-to bra (Elomi Energise). Although the Elila is expensive too the price here was reasonable so I decided to give it a try.The support is good. It definitely reminds me of bras that my grandma would wear with that odd pointy shape that it squashes your boobs into. However this is a wire-free bra so I knew that would be the case going into it. Since I was just getting it primarily to wear around the house I was not that concerned.I could not get past the itchy unpleasant feel of the fabric. I would have returned but I had already removed the tags and washed it since that usually helps to soften the fabric. I'm sure if I wore it more frequently it would soften but it felt like torture to me so I haven't been able to do that. However I am extremely sensitive to the feel of the fabric. I have Glamorise bras as well and while they are itchy to start out as well I think they are more comfortable in general (and a more reasonable price).But again the support was good. If you are looking for a wire-free bra that is very supportive and don't mind the shape that this gives you and are okay with breaking in the itchy firm fabric then I think you would be happy with this product. For me I will be investing in the Elomi Energise bra which does have a wire but is ridiculously comfortable flexes with me and has a nice smooth fabric that is not itchy. ",3.0

" The reason I like the Streets is because I don't like rap. I'm a total crossover fan but I am a fan. And what I liked about his last two releases is that they sounded so bizarre that it wasn't even like rap. As one friend described it 'a British guy talking over a drum beat' which is kind of true but gosh the things he said were just so great.Being an isolated American the most entertaining portrait I've ever seen of the underbelly of British culture is from two of my favorite movies Snatch and Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. And what's great about those movies is the extremely witty dialogue and the constant tongue in cheekery that goes on. Same goes for Mike Skinner's first two cds. I love hearing an honest everyman's point of view on such subjects as",3.0
" The first two albums The Streets put out blew me away. Original Pirate Material was fresh and abstract while A Grand Don't Come For Free was full of heart-felt tracks that I couldn't help but love. It seems with this album Mike Skinner got lazy. The music while catchy is hardly original and the lyrics... aren't even in the same league as the first two albums. When You Wasn't Famous the first single is just alright. I actually prefer the Professor Green remix. This album is mostly filler with a few good tracks like Never Went To Church. Overall I do like this album it just doesn't compare to the first two. ",3.0

" The positive thing about British Hip-Hop is the fact that it isn't purely like hip-hop here in the U.S. In Britain a lot of their hip-hop is a mix of electronica and a dance-pop feel. Us in the united states would most likely argue that our hip-hop in some instances is more about street cred. Where MC Skinner lacks in street cred he makes it up in the expletive heavy HARDEST WAY TO MAKE AN EASY LIVING which to its credit isn't a bad album. However after reading about the hype in a number of magazines and online articles the product was slightly disappointing.There are some genuine hits though they might not be mainstream hits of U.S. hip-hop. It is difficult to get past the fact that Skinner has a very heavy British accent. However tracks like 'Pranging Out' 'The Hardest Way To Make An Easy Living' 'Never Went To Church' and 'All Goes Out The Window' are very good. Even tracks that are more filler material feature exceptional production something that Skinner easily has above some of the producers in the U.S. The indie feel is something that more U.S. artist should explore.However there are missteps here. There are a few corny lines such as the 'cigarettes before matches line' in 'War of The Sexes' which all in all isn't bad. Also some of the songs come over as unrelatable and uninspired and grow rather boring. Even at its best occasionally the constantly looped production does grow a bit monotonous. What is important to understand here though is that Skinner is very different from U.S. hip hop and that is always a refreshment to see somebody who has a different twists on things. I was hoping this album would've been slightly better but I still liked the things that Skinner was doing. 3 stars. ",3.0
" A few years ago there was an explosion of sorts concerning British artists broadening rap like Dizzee Rascal and the Streets. I really couldn't get into it though; the thing that bothered me about Mike Skinner (yes people the Streets refers to ONE person) is that his material didn't sound like rap to me; it sounded more like spoken word. But he does sound more like a rapper on his latest offering The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living.But even though the production is on point the songs as a whole aren't that accessible. And I'm not saying that because Mike's thick accent can make things incomprehensible to the average listener (although there's some truth to that; 'War of the Sexes' anyone?); it's that most of the time I really don't understand what in the world he's talking about which is especially the case with the album's opener 'Prangin Out'.The few times where I COULD figure out what was going on I wasn't too impressed. 'Fake Streets Hats' has Mike complaining about supposedly pirated Streets merchandise (I say 'supposedly' because it turns out that Mike's label distributed the hats) and 'When You Wasn't Famous' is a been-there-done-that comparison of his private and public life. Speaking of that song when Mike and friends try to sing the chorus sometimes it's pretty nerve-racking (see 'Two Nations').I really think Mike could have done a better job than this; it almost feels like he just wanted to put SOMEthing out because now that Lady Sovereign is getting some mainstream love he's like 'Hey remember ME?' Let's hope he perfects his craft; maybe then it won't be so hard to make an easy living.Anthony Rupert ",3.0

" I couldn't find any relatively new information about this product running off of a Mac. Hopefully this'll be helpful to others. My machine is a Santa Rosa Intel 15' Macbook Pro running OSX 10.5 Leopard with 2 GB of memory.First off I'd like to point out that this is pretty much the same exact copy of Topic Entertainment's American Sign Language Deluxe as the other listings on Amazon. All of the copies are both Windows and Mac format all on the same discs.After copying the application to my local drive and running it I would get a series of repeating errors that would eventually lead to the application crashing. I sent in an email to Topic Entertainment's support group. Their response was that their title was only written with the intent of it only running on the system requirements printed on the box which is OSX 10.1 on a G4 and there were no plans to release an update for Leopard. They offered to return my copy for a refund if I wished.Not wanting to take no as an answer I fired up Windows XP SP2 through VMware Fusion and attempted to install the software. Worked like a charm videos are just as crisp as I'd expect them running natively on the Mac and disc swapping works correctly. There was an error during the installation about my copy of Quicktime being newer then the version required and asked me to first uninstall it before restarting the ASL Deluxe installation I clicked ok and the installation continued on as normal.I should also note that I've gone through and created ISO disc images of all eight discs through Windows and am storing them locally on my drive so I don't have to lug around all of the discs at once. This works fine VMware Fusion mounts ISO images without a problem.The software its self is a little clunky. The first disc offers some written words about ASL. What you're buying is on the rest of the discs a vast video library of others showing you words or phrases. I haven't played with it much past that there are some games I haven't touched.I'll update this review when I've had more of a chance to play with the software but for now I wanted to throw up the issues I had installing under 10.5.

" I bought ths terrific little saucepan at the beginning of 2009. It's supposed to have a lifetime warranty (hmmm my lifetime or its?)

" He came into the wrestling business being put in the same spotlight as Andre The Giant & for over the next 15 years he's definitely been one of the most dominate giants in the history of the business. From being 'Andre's son' to the 'World's Largest Athlete' the story of Paul Wight is finally being told. Throughout the documentary you'll hear from his various family & friends along with fellow WWE talents such as William Regal Triple H Arn Anderson Chavo Guerrero Edge John Cena Pat Patterson.The documentary begins with the story of how he was a small town boy (complete with footage from when he was a kid) to have health problems early & a heavy eating habit. How he played basketball with that ending up getting him suspended for 6 months is talked about before going into the story behind the issues with a tumor that caused his overgrowth & stories behind the job he had before going into wrestling. The documentary continues talking about how he was discovered by Hulk Hogan & trained at the WCW Power Plant with Triple H & William Regal commenting on his experiences there before going into how he got the spot that he did resulting in winning the World Championship in his very first match. His ability to be very athletic for his size as far as speed coming off the top rope and doing moves likes dropkicks were heavily discussed before going into the problems he had in WCW with Triple H having his own theory of what went wrong there. The story behind Show's WWE debut at the St. Valentine's Day Massacre PPV was talked about next before going into how he was miserable in his early WWE career before talking about how certain veterans like Undertaker helped mentor him. A big highlight of the documentary happened next as the real life story behind the storyline with Big Boss Man in regards to his father's death was heavily discussed including why they had to take a more comedic approach as the storyline went along as opposed to keeping it serious. His first WWE Championship win the concept behind his entertaining impressions and his reasoning behind his time in the OVW developmental territory are discussed before talking about his dominance in the ring with such highlights as when him & Brock Lesnar broke the ring. We get a tour of his personal traveling bus along with the story behind why he got it & what he brought to the ECW brand was discussed before going into his new training methods that helped him lose weight & stay healthy with the feud with Floyd Mayweather (including getting his nose broken) & his acting roles (Knucklead Waterboy SNL) finish out the documentary.Matches Include",3.0

The noise level was GREAT for the first few years but it has recently gotten much louder and is almost impossible to hear any TV/DVD audio once riding it.

The wheel makes a loud clicking noise that progressively gets worse. When I watch the TV while I ride on the trainer the TV slowly gets turned up until my wife comes in and asks why the TV is so loud. I rated this 3 stars because it is average which is unfortunately what I expected. I did not want to spend the money on a fluid trainer so I got the Magneto based on reviews and recommendations.

My biggest complaints are that it is very noisy (which is annoying in an apartment building) and the resistance is not very strong (fine if you are going for an easy ride but not quite enough if you are trying to do high intensity intervals).

It wasn't until I got to that part of the installation that I realized I would need to buy a new wheel to be able to use the skewer they provide that locks into the trainer.

" Chald if I didn't see it I wouldn't have believed it. Goya drew a photo of someone lighting a lamp by flatuating on it! Today some call that 'fart lighting.' Whoa! It was a trip seeing something like that in a serious documentary.This work had many scholars providing interviews as opposed to just having only two. The narrator has poor Spanish pronunciation. He said 'Josefa' as if the E was a short English one. He said 'Cadiz' as if the last syllable was a short English I. The documentary is filled with grainy reenactments that some may not be able to see. I found the inclusion distracting.Like Beethoven and Edison Goya went deaf. Those interested in famous people with disabilities may want to read more about that. Perhaps it would make for a good paper in a disability studies class. I'm shocked to learn that Goya was targeted by the Inquisition because I would have assumed that body died approximately 100 years before his adulthood. The narrator contrasted how other countries were embracing the Enlightenment while Spain ignored it. This reminded me of how Franco spent myriad years ruling Spain at a time when other countries staunchly rejected Fascism.Most viewers know Goya for his formal non-controversial works. This documentary proved that he made dark and risqu'e paintings that could still be seen as shocking. ",3.0
" This Side of the Sky is a beautiful story of two life long friends Myraleen and Lilian who grew up in Nadir Mississippi and went on to see and experience the world. Sometimes tragic yet always poignant Ms. Singleton's novel is an enthralling read. The time period of this novel spans over 70 years- from the 1930s when the girls lived with the constant reminder that the color of their skin precluded them from reaching the highest heights to the year 2000 when color is a hue on one spectrum.It took a good 50 pages to draw me into the characters. Many times Myraleen and Lilian looked at the same situation from different perspectives. I found it amazing how captivating their friendship was. It endured a lifetime with hardly a disagreement or regret. Ms. Singleton's research made This Side of the Sky come to life. The historical accuracy of the plight of African American's during periods of social change in our country kept the characters fresh and my enthusiasm to read was intensified. The social aspects of their relationships with others made reading multidimensional. I even received an education learning that there was a far greater contingent of African Women who served as part of the Women's Auxiliary Corps in World War II than I imagined. Rising from seemingly hopeless childhoods to become well-rounded well-traveled well-versed ladies who enjoyed their lives This Side of the Sky drew me in and kept me until the end. ",3.0

You can choose from a wide variety of characters each with thier own unique skills and fighting style and the audio and graphics aren't too bad either.The only majoy dissapointment I had with the game is entirely mini games. You can unlock cool abilities for each character and it can take a little stratagy to think of how or which character to use for each mission that you choose. But overall the game just didn't have much to offer in terms of keeping you attention for more than 5-10min at a time.If your looking for a way to pass a little time you could really do worse and if your a fan of the series you'll probably get a lot out of this. But I think you could do better with some of the other Naruto games. ",3.0

" Faces (John Cassavettes 1968)I have to rank myself among those having seen Faces who understand its importance in the film world but can't bring themselves to like the movie. I understand why Cassavettes did the things he did with this movie why the film is supersaturated and the sound mix is awful and all the other little quirks that kept this so far away from Hollywood and its subject matter is conceptually brilliant; the question one has to put to oneself is whether you're actually going to be able to sit through two hours plus of what is essentially boring and obnoxious cocktail-party banter even after the cocktail party itself is long over.The main characters in Faces are a married couple Richard and Maria Forst (John Marley and Lynn Carlin) who have found their marriage going stale and in response each flirts with the idea of finding a younger lover. The results of their dalliances however are anything but the pleasant no-strings-attached sex each was hoping for; in fact the consequences are potentially disastrous.It's a great idea and I do like the way it's carried off most of the time. Technically it's a brilliant approach to the subject; Cassavettes gives us washed-out characters in a washed-out film bending every aspect of the moviemaking process to the psyches of the people he's got in front of the camera. And the script works right along with that premise; if you have washed-out characters in a washed-out film what other sort of dialogue should they have saved washed out? Unfortunately however this has always been my problem with 'The Dead' that short story of James Joyce's that everyone but me seems to love. My take on it is that Joyce was subscribing to the hypothesis 'if you want to write a story about boring people write a boring story'. And the story certainly succeeds beyond any reasonable bounds in that regard which I assume is why so many people like it. Similarly Faces; Cassavettes has done a fantastic job of it here though substituting 'washed-out' (I can't imagine anyone calling these folks 'boring'). And it's a deft and proficient depiction of the characters. It's the characters themselves that get on my nerves. *** ",3.0
" The trademark of John Cassavetes films is emotions laid bare. You might call this an emotion strip tease without the tease. This film is no exception. However it is not as focused as his later Woman Under the Influence or Opening Night. Some scenes loose their effectiveness by their length. A tighter editing would have worked wonders. Nevertheless the film has a strong emotional impact a harbinger of his later films and arresting structural innovations; well worth watching. ",3.0
" Watch the lives of a group of list-sisters unfold through a series of messages between them and their families and through two email loops. While the primary email loop is called the SAHM I AM loop and moderated by the self righteous Rosalyn there is a secondary one Green Eggs and Ham in which the more disgruntled members diss Ros and her toady Connie. Through the months covered crises frequently pop up; marital woes adoption and fertility issues child rearing catastrophes past mistakes that need to be paid for in the present and health issues that may not be life threatening but are heart breaking. Rosalyn's life is not as trouble free and June Cleaverish as she pretends on the loop and her facade could collapse if her sister is allowed to join the group because Ronnie knows the truth that Ros is not a Proverbs 31 ideal woman.*** While there is no one main plot a series of subplots threads together. Though this lack of coherence is a definite drawback the characters are so true to life that there is something endearing about this novel. Anyone who has been on a loop with a troll will be doing their best bobble head impression nodding along with the on target descriptions of the reactions of the Green Eggs group to the bad aspects of the SAHM one. Yet there is also the very positive light that is shone on how supportive and true email friends can be. *** ",3.0

" This is an amusing if slightly odd story. I guess that Ruskin considered himself such an intellectual jack of all trades that he'd a have a go at the genre if only to say he'd done it.The story is built from familiar parts. There's a Cinderella theme built around a young boy and his two cruel brothers. There's also a theme of the wandering stranger who after being treated well or poorly rewards the doer equally well or poorly. In fact that was such a cool idea that Ruskin threw in two magical beings quite independent of each other making the front and back halves of this little creature look like thay came from two different animals.It's a pleasant enough fairy tale but not one that I'd spend a lot of time hunting down.//wiredweirdPS",3.0
" In this book Petroski brings up a few good points. Engineering is human. Engineers as oppose to what some think are not perfect. They are not able to create a perfect design for the given problem. They create what they believe is the best solution for the given design specifications. They along with others test their solution in theory. The majority of these solutions are created and succeed perfectly. Although most of these designs are successful some are not.It seems to be most of the failures of designs happen when it deals with something big including the Kansas City Hyatt Regency Hotel walkways which killed over 100 people or the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. These failures become famous and the engineers are the first ones to be looked at.Along with engineering success comes failure. This is a part of being human. Human engineering will always have its failures along with its successes. When engineers build something they analyze it to determine if their solution is the best solution. Sometimes it takes a failure for the engineers to see their failures and to correct the problem. This book tries to explain this and does in most cases. In some of the cases it leaves the reader wondering what else could have been done or what needs to be done in the future to prevent these failures. ",3.0

" 'Operation Condor' is similar in style to 'Rush Hour' or 'Mr. Nice Guy'. These are examples of Chan`s later movies in which he tries to burst through to America by breaking free from his Hong Kong roots. The production values are far glossier than his earlier movies - this one is shot on location in the Phillipines Spain and Morroco. In the film Chan and three female friends (one Japanese one Chinese one German) journey into the desert to find hidden gold - and get into comic scrapes. Sadly the version I saw featured appallingly sloppy dubbing into English which made it feel as if the film was produced in the U.S not Hong Kong. In a bizarre way this works to Chan`s advantage. He works well with the supporting cast generally fooling around and displaying a fine line in comic timing and Buster Keaton style slapstick which is very entertaining. A good fun film. Don`t expect a kung-fu classic like 'Fist Of Fury' because you won`t get it. But remember Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee are different. Chan was trained to entertain his audience and this film will entertain all who see it. ",3.0
" Jackie Chan is a physical genius and thistogether with a sense of comedy and an air of winning self-deprecationhelp set his movies apart from those of other action stars such as the wooden Van Damme and the pompous dirigible Seagal.The physical skills are well in evidence here as are the comedy traits -although personally I find them less well showcased this time aroundOperation Condor is clearly an expensive movie and makes widespread use of well photographed North African and European locations in its tale of Chan and some female colleagues hunting abandoned Nazi gold in the face of opposition from Arab terrorists and one of the gold's former owners.There are draggy bits in the middle when the story gets bogged down in broad comedic interludes and the dubbing throughout is execrable.All is forgiven when it comes to the climax -an elongated fight scene in a wind tunnel that has flair pace and panache.The end credits show the injury sustained by Chan in making the movie when a stunt went wrong-proof that here is an action star who does not stint on placing himself on the line .Four stars for Chan -and marked down only for the dubbing and the misfiring comedy scenes which simply dont travel well to Occidental audiences ",3.0

" What you can learn from reading other reviews! As my wife sat and watched this movie I kept thinking that the big explosion at the end reminded me of another movie..the far superior LONG KISS GOODNIGHT. And now that I have read the other reviews I see where they used footage from CLIFFHANGER and NARROW MARGIN. Hmmm...studios will go to extreme lengths to make movies huh?As far as the rest of the movie goes Treat Williams is all but lost in a small role as the CIA special agent with the warped sense of humor. Most of the focus is given to the budding romance of John Beck and Susan Blakeley survivors of the ridiculously staged plane crash. Add Bongo the Bear and a subdued Steve Franken and there's even more foolishness. Not to mention the other survivors who go off on their own; one dies from unknown causes; the stupid wildlife t.v. star (hah) shows her stupidity by firing a gun and causing an avalance that wipes out everyone except the two lovebirds who have just reconciled. We also have a crooked pilot a diabetic man and his daughter and oh yes a Tessla device that uses brainwaves to cause nuclear destruction.Why the three stars? The scenery is beautiful; I found myself interested in spite of myself and some of the performances were enjoyable particularly Ms. Blakeley's alcoholic writer. But the big 'character development' scenes only served to slow down the movie's overall pacing. But considering the theft from other movies one can only laugh and say gee whiz!!! ",3.0
" For and 'original work' how could the producers and director hope to get away with the 'Cliffhanger' 'Narrow Margin' and 'A Long Kiss Goodnight' cut and paste scenes. These are not copies these are the actual scenes from the movies cut and pasted into this one. My son about fell out of his chair as we watched the plane and helicopter sequences the chases and train sequenses the semi truck sequences and climactic explosion that we had seen from other movies. He wanted to know if those actors got royalties off of this movie especially Craig Berko who was clearly seen but not credited.That aside there were many cliche moments some good lines and some very bad dialog. But it was worth watching especially with someone who does not know (or even one who does but hasn't yet seen it) about the cut and paste because it makes for a hilarious (absolutely unintended by the makers I'm sure) movie experience and a great conversation after the movie among friends. I have never had such an experience before... ",3.0
" Jerry Stahl seems to be able to find the sarcastic and sardonic humor in even the most downtrodden lives. 'I Fatty' is a firsthand account of Fatty Arbuckle's tumultuous life. It's written very simply and helps us to imagine the inner turmoil of being an outsider in a judgemental society.Born to an abusive father in Kansas Arbuckle turned to theatre as an escape from a bitter life. He rose to fame in the cinema and at one point was more popular than Chaplin. He was the first screen actor to make a million dollars a year.But in 1921 he was accused of the rape and murder of actress Virginia Rappe. He was slandered by the press and not even his acquittal could save his career. He eventually lost everything.Stahl emphasizes the mental anguish of being fat impotent and presumed guilty. He also shows the role that heroin played in Fatty Arbuckle's life. Heroin was readily available and legal at the time and he became addicted using it as a pain killer after a botched medical procedure. Towards the end of his years his servant used heroine as a tool to get Arbuckle to divulge all of his secrets.I had the pleasure of hearing Stahl read from the book and it was quite entertaining. He joked that it is obligatory for him to include heroin in every one of his novels. He emphasizes the public outcry against Fatty as being led by a conservative anti-Hollywood element. I would agree but would also like to point out that in the 1920s journalists had more leeway to embelish the truth and print it as fact. Even today the press chooses to emphasize some facts over others and often slanders people in the process.If you are interested in the life of one of Hollywood's first stars and if you like dark humor 'I Fatty' is for you. It's a good read that will make you think and give you a laugh or two. ",3.0
" Roscoe Arbuckle was a fat man who lived a tragic life. He was born in Kansas to an abusive father and invalid mother. The father taunted him for his considerable girth while beating him with a strap. Roscoe ran away after a year or so of grammer school to hit the boards in vaudeville.Underneath the all too too sullied flesh there was a good brain and warm heart. Fatty became famous as a star comedian along with opium addicted Mabel Normand in the Keystone Cop flicks. Fatty knew them all-Chaplin Keaton and Lloyd. He was the first Hollywood star to make a million dollars a year and was loved by the vast American public who enjoyed a night at the flickers.Along the way he engaged in many bad habits such as heroin and opium usage excessive eating and drinking enough to drown several grown men. He was known as 'The Prince of Whales.' Arbuckle was always well dressed knew his lines and was eager to help newcomers in the business.Fatty's life went down the spout when he was accused of the rape and murder of the floozy Virginia Rappe in a St. Francis Hotel Room in San Francisco. Fatty endured three trials and terrible publicity. He was finally acquitted but his career was in shambles. He went on to direct a few movies under an assumed name and opened a nightclub but the damage had been done to his career. Fatty married three times endured several physical afflictions and was the first big star whose scandal gave Hollywood a bad reputation in middle America.Jerry Stahl has done his research on the Arbuckle life and career. Arbuckle (1887-1933) was an important figure in early film comedy who deserves to be studied. ",3.0
" Let me begin by stressing that Jerry Stahl is by all means a good writer. I FATTY is an enjoyable read in some ways; but also a distressful one particularly to fans of silent film comedian Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle. Johnny Depp is quoted as describing the novel as 'the true skinny' on the comedian. With all due respect to this very talented actor I am somewhat puzzled by his statement. Having read the novel twice I found the Roscoe of Stahl's novel to be pretty much a bitter rudely-spoken and generally depressing incarnation which is hardly synonymous with how Roscoe's friends and associates remembered him. Though I cannot be certain of course it seems to me that Stahl's main motive for writing this novel stems from a fascination in a life which certainly was plagued by much pain and injustice. Roscoe had a very sad childhood left alone to his violent alcoholic father after his mother's early death and constantly teased at school for his overweight; and while he admirably managed to outwin much of the traumas of his early years going on to become one of the most celebrated film comedians of his time his career was ruined after he was wrongly accused of rape and manslaughter in 1921. Roscoe played the sidekick of Charlie Chaplin early on in the latter's film career and was the one who directly introduced Buster Keaton to the world of celluloid.A fascinating subject for a novel no doubt. However the fact that all persons directly involved in Roscoe's life have in all probability deceased by now should not mean that ehtical deference can be ignored altogether. The events described does not require that far a dive into the past after all; the scandal which ruined Roscoe's life happened less than a hundred years ago. In my opinion Stahl far too seldom seems to take into consideration that his characters are based on real human beings. Perhaps this is a matter of necessity from an author's point of view; in order to make a character come alive on the page focus on plain facts may indeed be a hindrance. A character based solely on facts and authentic observations would possibly turn out too realistic to be believable in the context of a novel. Yet what troubles me most with I FATTY is that it recalls Roscoe's entire story seemingly first-hand from his perspective and I'm not convinced that the book's admission of being a 'novel' on the cover will prevent people less acquainted with Arbuckle's life to interpret too much of this as the truth or close to it (Charles Nordhoff and James N. Hall's novel 'Mutiny on the Bounty' and its arguably inaccurate portrayal of Captain Bligh comes to mind).A few distressing examples",3.0
" Some of this book may be true. Jerry Stahl has thoughtfully included an impressive bibliography for us to mull over.But a lot of this is known to be untrue. So I had to drop a couple of stars off what otherwise is a pretty readable biography of Roscoe. He didn't like the sobriquet 'Fatty' you know.Stahl has a breezy pitter-patter style that keeps you turning pages even though it wears thin occasionally.But the real problem I have with the book is it seems apparent to me he just doesn't like Arbuckle very much. He gives the misfortune of the great fat man too much credence as if Roscoe deserved what he got.In the mid 70s I was in Hollywood trying to break into acting. For amusement my girlfriend and I chased down infamous old Tinsel Town addresses as we boned up on the angst their former owners had experienced. Arbuckle's house on West Adams is still there but by then no one believed any of the stories about Roscoe's 'parties'. He had become a tragic figure an example of Moviedom overreaction to what should have been page 6 minor news.I respect Stahl for researching and writing this book. I just wish he'd stuck closer to the truth. ",3.0
" It's not a bad book really. It just drags a bit. I never felt like I was in the head of Fatty Arbuckle telling his story. I felt instead like I was reading someone trying a bit too hard to speak like him. It comes off as stilted and after a while makes the book a chore.There's an interesting story here especially since the subject matter is so tragic. The man was railroaded and ruined because of it. His fall from grace was an awful thing and you really feel for the guy when you learn about his story.Unfortunately this isn't the best telling of that story. He doesn't even make the character that likable and gets some of the historical facts completely wrong.Stahl is a great writer so I wanted something better than this. It's slow and frankly just not that interesting. ",3.0
" The concept of I Fatty is a good one--a novel written as if it is the autobiography a controversial historical figure.

Some parts of the book just did not feel like first person narratives. ",3.0

There are a few places that look a little pixelated but nothing that ruins the viewing experience.

Kevin Bacon Fred Ward and Reba McEntire head up a cast that's about as one-dimensional as it gets flaunting their stereotypes with enthusiasm in the midst of an utterly ridiculous set of circumstances. The premise behind the monsters is original and the effects actually look pretty solid considering their age but the concept is pushed to such extremes that there's nothing to do but laugh at the sheer ballsy idiocy of it all. It's stupid thin and thoroughly overdone but just as much dumb naked fun to watch today as it was when I first caught it at the age of twelve.

" After being unable to obtain this from an online store during the Christmas season I finally found this exceptional video yesterday at an offline store. It is another program in the brilliant 'Bell Telephone Hour' series which ran on NBC-TV for nine years during the 1950's and '60's after being a radio program for many more years.For a filmed television program that was made thirty-four years ago this long unseen documentary is in remarkably good condition. It is a beautifully photographed (in color) documentary-concert which combines a tour of the Prado Museum in Spain with musical performances by such great Spanish classical artists as guitarist Andres Segovia pianist Alicia de Larrocha and operatic soprano Victoria de los Angeles as well as a flamenco dance troupe. Although Mr. Segovia's narration is stiff self-conscious (we notice that he looks off to the side at the teleprompter) conductor Donald Voorhees's share of the narration is eloquently spoken.However although the narration is informative nobody really watches a program like this just for information-- although presented like this it never becomes boring. We are treated to breathtaking closeups of the paintings of Velasquez El Greco and Goya and part of the excellence of this program is that unlike other museum tours on video this one manages to avoid sounding like a dry lecture.There is another dimension to this video perhaps the most important and this unfortunately is where it falls short. Apparently the producers were so eager to inform us about the paintings that they decided to give the music rather short shrift. Almost without exception every time Segovia or Larrocha launch into a classical piece (and their performances are naturally brilliant) more narration intrudes into the program and the music is reduced to mere background accompaniment. And Segovia's performance of Albeniz's unforgettable 'Leyenda' one of the most famous pieces ever written for classical guitar is abridged! Only at the end of the program do the makers of this film seem to come to their senses when Segovia formally announces that Victoria de los Angeles is about to sing and she is allowed to perform her aria with no interruption or commentary.This offhand carelessness about musical content is NOT typical of the 'Bell Telephone Hour'. In such past programs as 'First Ladies of the Opera' 'A Trip to Christmas' (yes that is the correct title) and others the music always came first. We could have been just as well served if the filmmakers had concentrated on showing us the paintings and displaying their titles onscreen while letting us hear the performances. Perhaps that would have made it less of a documentary but who cares when you can hear music like this performed by these musicians? ",3.0

" There's a great 1994 Lars Von Trier movie (with a 1997 sequel) largely not available in the US dealing with a ghost child haunting a hospital called The Kingdom in Denmark. This hospital was built over old bleaching pools (rather than a textile mill) responsible for the death of this child and others (continual exposure to chlorine gas). In the film one of the main characters is an older psychic lady who continually feigns illness to be admitted to the hospital to investigate the haunting. Responding to a ghostly child's cry she gathers other patients and hospital workers together for seances as part of her investigation. Coincidence? This Diary of Eleanor Druse is a work of fiction as noted in the wee letters on the cover and is obviously based on King's reworking of the earlier movie if not written by King himself under a pseudonym changing the location to his usual Maine settings. Heaven knows who the Eleanor Druse that reads the book on tape is. Von Trier's movie (which may have originally been a TV series in itself it's never been clear) is a quirky and sometimes very creepy piece of work. Highly recommended to anyone that doesn't mind a four-hour film in Danish crossing ER with Twin Peaks. I'd be very surprised if the US television remake will be anywhere as atmospheric or original. As for the book - probably an adaptation of a screenplay which itself is the adaptation of another screenplay. ",3.0

That book has a more in the way of references to support these types of theories. It also has more objectivity. My problem with the book is that the author approaches the subject with an almost intolerant Christian perspective. Everything else is pretty much viewed as evil. You find yourself interested in the subject matter but having to screen out the Christian right mentality of the author to get anything out of it. This makes the work a provocative but an unenjoyable read. ",3.0

This book may have you looking at everyone you see in a funny way for a while but in the end it should be viewed as mere entertainment.

The book concentrated on Freemasonry though later touched on the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) and its 'secret agenda'.

The music and lyrics aren't in the same league as subsequent works by Webber and Tim Rice.That said I did enjoy this production. Donny Osmond turns in a great performance in the lead role. The costumes and sets while garish are in keeping with the tone set by Rice's tongue-in-cheek lyrics. If you like DTS you'll be happy to know this DVD contains both DTS 5.1 and DD 5.1 soundtracks.

" I am glad I read the review posted here before I decided to just give my daughter the tape. I watched the video first. I refer to the scene between Joseph and Mrs. Potiphar. There is another scene in the movie that I consider 'costume' racy. This is not a family film. My children would know that this is not the norm. The female costume attire that was in the Mrs. Potiphar scene and the other; quite revolting. Strategically placed glitter on nude fabric or pasties on nude material. The scene itself was provocative and lasted longer than just a few quick seconds... This to me spoiled an otherwise fabulous movie. Wonderful vocals costuming was great - otherwise acting was great not many props but those used were good. Also on the video as mentioned on the DVD reviews Joan is displayed with an all black dress on the back cover. This is not the case in her scene as anyone who watches will see. Maybe I should have given this movie four stars but I was disappointed to see a 'family film' with costuming and a provocative scene such as this. At this point I do not yet know that I will give it to my daughter for Christmas. I have older children and they will pick up on the ... innuendo. Though I was quite taken with the video overall I don't know that it will hold the attention of a five year old for that long. I liked the way the film gave a modern interpretation to a classic Bible story. Also the 'trailer' into the video is long and has a racy video advertisement... ",3.0

" I don't think any one ever tried to pass off _Joeseph_ as a really great show. It is light superficial entertainment that an entire family can enjoy and there's nothing wrong with that.

Throughught the movie There are these little pericriol school children who get up and clap after big production numbers as if to say to us the viewers",3.0
" Many of the costumes in this production are bodysuits designed to make it look like the actors are nude except for bits of strategic glitter. If it were rated this video would garner a PG. This will not be objectionable to most people but this video is being marketed as a 'show for the whole family' and if you are a conservative parent you may not want your kids watching it. For a good laugh pick up the video box in your local video store and look at the picture of Joan Collins on the back. Her costume (which normally makes her look like she's topless) has been carefully colored in on the top!That warning aside it's a fairly good video. I did not care for the way the show was framed as a production at a school and the children's chorus was actually annoying in spots. However most of the excitement and fun of the stage production comes through and Donny Osmond is fabulous as Joseph. ",3.0

" This delightful little piece was created for a boys' school many years ago. It is a humorous re-telling of the Old Testament story of Joseph and his brothers who sell him into slavery in Egypt. Because it is both funny and heart-warming it has been in production ever since. Joseph offers many varieties of music from a Country/Western howdown ('One More Angel in Heaven') to a French Apache-dance lament ('Zose Canaan Days...') and a howlingly funny 'Grovel Grovel' when the brothers are literally brought to their knees. Watch it! ",3.0
" In my opinion the most apt description of this video is the one amazon.com has given it above.Bright colorful playful musical and even a bit zany JOSEPH comes to technicolor life in this one of a kind show. It seems though that audiences will love it or hate it. I guess I fall somewhere in between.While the performers take a tiny bit of getting used to especially for those familiar with the show once you get the idea that this is a show within a show within a movie then you are halfway there. You have to watch it with a sense of fun and joy. It reminded me of 'Joseph' as performed by the cast of 'Willy Wonka' thrown into the set of 'Brazil' with a dash of 'Sillyville' and 'Las Vegas Glitz'. This is not a serious treatment of the material but rather a comical one (or one with tongue placed firmly in cheek). View it that way and you will have a ball.The sets are phenomenal especially the giant Pharoah head and the magical 'cartoon' desert. I can't believe I was laughing so hard so many times as I know the material so well and was consistently surprised by the manner in which it was portrayed.As for the suggestive costumes they last merely seconds on the screen and concerned parents (see posts below) should learn how to program their parental controls on their DVD players. Other parents would realize that little kids won't even notice what the big deal is all about (They will probably simply cover their eyes if they react at all!). Kids see worse on MTV!As for irreverance I would bet more kids would be likely to crack open a bible after watching this than those who had never heard of it.As a big fan of Webber and Rice I am glad that this video has finally been made even if I would have liked to have seen it done differently. Take it lightly and you will have an 'amazing' time. ",3.0

" I absolutely love both the Canadian cast and the Broadway cast soundtracks so I was excited to see this production. I wish I could say that I was excited to HAVE seen it but it was just okay. Donny Osmond does a great job...he's the best thing in here. I know Maria Friedberg is an up and coming name in musical theatre but I was extremely disappointed in her performance. Her voice doesn't have the strength of the leads on the cast recordings and she mugged her way through a lot of the numbers which would work on stage where everything needs to be exaggerated but doesn't work here. (To be fair most of the cast does the same.) It was a little distracting that the singing on some of the numbers was not syncronized with the actors' lip movements. It's better than nothing though and everytime Donny Osmond takes center stage you forget the flaws. ",3.0
" Let me start by stating this is perrenial favorite of mine. I've attended several productions of this from Tuacahn to high school productions. My daughters drove me nuts playing the soundtrack. I finally broke down and bought the DVD.Let me also state that we have high Christian standards. This did not meet those standards. My wife and I both flinched several times while viewing this version.Some of the costume are very risque' and some of the behaviors are very inappropriate. The Potipahr's wife scene was just short of brazen nudity and overly sexual.The narrator was not up to the caliber of other performances I've seen and Richard Attenborough did a mediocre job as Jacob. Donny Osmond played Joseph well and continues to deliver the level of vocal performance he was known for in the 70's.I liked the sets and the creativity although a 'for film' version would have been nice.The sound was poor. We had to adjust it several times during our viewing especially in the beginning.Minus one star for inappropriate material. Minus one star for poor sound.

The problem is in the narration. Ugh! While viewing some of the most exciting scenery in the world and gaining some insight into the many cultures of Africa the narrator seems determined to put the viewer to sleep. And rather than give the viewer a real taste of the local music whenever someone bursts into song whether in a children's game or at a funeral they have chosen to pipe in some over-produced studio version of 'African' music that is full of western influences. Indiginous African music is so beautiful in its rawest form; don't insult your audience by assuming that we can't appreciate music that hasn't been cleaned up and westernized. ",3.0

" Every militant who wants to fight for socialism or put the fight for socialism back on the front burner needs to come to terms with the legacy of Vladimir Lenin and his impact on 20th century revolutionary thought. Every radical who believes that society can be changed by just a few adjustments needs to address this question as well in order to understand the limits of such a position. Thus it is necessary for any politically literate person of this new generation to go through the arguments both politically and organizationally associated with Lenin's name. Before delving into his works a review of his life and times would help to orient those unfamiliar with the period. Obviously the best way to do this is read one of the many biographies about him. There is not dearth of such biographies although they overwhelmingly tend to be hostile. But so be it. For those who prefer a quick snapshot view of his life this documentary although much much too simply is an adequate sketch of the highlights of his life.The film goes through his early childhood the key role that the execution of older brother for an assassination attempt on the Czar played in driving him to revolution his early involvement in the revolutionary socialist movement his imprisonments and internal and external exiles his role in the 1905 Revolution his role in the 1917 Revolution his consolidation of power and his untimely death in 1924. An added feature as usual in these kinds of films is the use of `talking heads' who periodically explain what it all meant. I would caution those who are unfamiliar with the history of the anti-Bolshevik movement that three of the commentators Adam Ulam Richard Daniels and Robert Conquest were `stars' of that movement at the height of the anti-Soviet Cold War. I would also add that nothing presented in this biography despite the alleged additional materials available with the `opening' of the Soviet files has not been familiar for a long time. ",3.0

" This is a much needed well written and finely translated defense of metaphysics in the light of Heideggerian and postmodern criticism. However it fails ultimately because of some bad choices in terminology light scholarship and a narrow understanding of metaphysics. The author doesn't quote any work by anyone written in the last 30 years and focuses only on a few lines of Heidegger ignoring some clear statements by Heidegger that would have resolved issues that trouble Sacchi. Not only that but a more careful reading of Heidegger would show that his views are not as radically opposed to metaphysics as Sacchi understands it. Sacchi rejects the metaphysycs of 'pagans' like the pre-Socratics and while it would seem he represents Scholasticism he will further claim that medieval Scholasticism is decadent. What we are left with is Aquinas's metaphysics alone perhaps some Aristotle by extension. Not a word on whether Plato's ontology is to be rejected as well.What is most frustrating about this book is how the word 'being' is used. The ontological difference is clear and simple. There are beings and there is Being. Sacchi transforms this into 'being and Sein'. One has to read then the word 'being' as 'beings' most of the time I think. For Sacchi Sein is a fabrication of Heidegger's mind and a replacement for god. So there are beings (being in Sacchi's terminology) and god. Fine. He also speaks of 'being as such' and it is unclear if this means beings as such or something else. Then he introduces the act/process of entification which he later terms the act of being. Presumably one is to read this as 'act of beings'. The problem is that Sacchi assignes as the source of this act sometimes beings and sometimes something else (god?). Beings the act of being and that which is by virtue of itself and nothing else all relate by participation-- reminding us of that pagan Plato. While I don't know Aquinas as well as Heidegger or ancient Greeks Aquinas does not seem as complex as Sacchi makes him to be. Heidegger's phenomenology would be a great resource the think about this curious and almost Platonic in-between",3.0

" We were comparing this unit to an older very similar model X-Acto we have. It is faster (the motor is stronger) and quieter than the older similar model we bought a couple of years ago. The point that is put on the pencils exposes slightly more wood which is good if you tend to hold the pencil by the exposed wood. It also has a nice amount of heft to it that means you don't have to hold it while you are sharpening--it will stay in place even as you push pencils in.However the cup is really disappointing. It is shallow and makes a mess when it is pulled out. We had filled the cup with shavings after only sharpening about 10 pencils. Also the accumulated static electricity made the wood shavings jump around and get on everything. So while the motor is heavy duty and the point it makes is pretty good the cup for the shavings is way too shallow for a 'heavy duty' machine. I contrast it to the Stanley Bostitch EPS12HC SuperPro 6 which has a cup at least 10 times the size of this X-Acto.However the Bostich doesn't put as nice a point on pencils. So if you are sharpening only a very small amount then the emptying of the cup won't be as big an issue for you and there is a good chance you'll like the point this machine makes. ",3.0

Finally the pencil savings cup is one of the smallest I have seen. Honestly for a product priced and positioned as a Premium Sharpener the size of the shavings cup is somewhat laughable.The X-ACTO Teacher Pro (1675) sharpener I have had vastly superior results with it features a large cup and costs less.Unless I received a bad unit I just can't recommend this over other sharpeners. Even if I got a bad unit it doesn't excuse the insane small shavings cup an area that the Teacher Pro model excels at. ",3.0
" I wanted to like the 'X-Acto 1645 Deluxe Heavy-Duty Electric Pencil Sharpener' more than I did.To be sure it does what it needs to do - puts a fine point on a pencil a third quicker than most. Plus it's hefty weighing in at 2 pounds 5 ounces on my kitchen scale; and at only 4' wide by 4' high by 6' deep it feels dense and sturdy. But as I sharpen only a few times a day 'heavy duty' isn't something I can attest to so I'll fall back on the wisdom of Jurassic Park... Gennaro",3.0

I wanted more actual ideas and theory and things I could do to help me and less focus on her story. Some of the activities were thought provoking and rewarding.

" GABRIEL'S BLOCKBUSTER ALBUM.RUINED BY MEDIOCRE SOUND QUALITY KNOCKING A FIVE STAR CLASSIC DOWN TO THREE STARS. DO NOT BUY THE ORIGINAL BUT GET THE REMASTERED VERSION INSTEAD.Released in 1986 this was Gabriel's blockbuster album. And it deserved it. This is just great from beginning to end. It features great collaborations with Kate Bush and Laurie Anderson.Unfortunately coming out in 1986 the CD sound quality was mediocre. This was very suprising for Gabriel who had embraced digital technology years earlier. The sound is flat with limited dynamic range.Many of the early CD's had mediocre sound quality which gave rise to the vinyl snobs who thought CD's could never sound as good as LP's. But it was just a bad translation to the digital technoology. Today CD's sound much better than they did 20 years ago. Which is why you see so many 'remaatered' CD's today. That includes the complete Gabriel catalog.Not only being the most popular Gabriel CD it is his best. That is saying a lot since he has had many very good CD's. ",3.0
" After flirting with commercial success through his first several albums and having several modest hits Peter Gabriel finally broke into the commercial consciousness.'Security' began to open up the fears and paranoias on 'Peter Gabriel 3'-- yeah it had some of that but it emphasized the world elements and introduced a somber reflective side to the dense dark music on '3'. And it also introduced a funky modern sound. 'So' is really the reconciliation of all of these elements. Once again supported by guitarist David Rhodes bassist Tony Levin and drummer Jerry Marrotta (Larry Fast is sadly not to be found on this record) Gabriel augments his old team with drummer Manu Katche and guitarist/producer Daniel Lanois and several guests including violinist L. Shankar drummer Stewart Copeland (of the Police) singers Youssou N'Dour Kate Bush and Laurie Anderson bassist Bill Laswell and guitarist Nile Rodgers.The album's opener really displays the new styles here at its best-- 'Red Rain' is a ballad but it moves its got an undercurrent of funkiness to it similarly 'Don't Give Up' (featuring a duet with Kate Bush) again as a ballad (and a dark one) is bass driven with a funk undercurrent and gospel bridge. These two are absolutely stunning and unique in music even to this day. While 'Mercy Street' is a bit more traditional in its structure it is another incredible ballad with a stunning vocal harmony arrangement in the chorus.The funk elements come out stronger in a couple other (and more famous) album tracks 'Sledgehammer' and 'Big Time'. Modern synth-driven in many ways with incredible bass courtesy of Tony Levin these two are monsters that arrived on the scene at a perfect time. My only complaint is that they like the largely straightahead pop of 'That Voice Again' are a drift both lyrically and musically from what Gabriel excels at-- taking pain darkness other elements of people's lives and making them internal and personal. Look at 'Don't Give Up'-- it sounds like he wrote it about himself but its about a Depression photograph. These are great songs but they're a bit too clean and pop for my tastes.'We Do What We're Told' and 'This is the Picture' move closer in the direction of 'Security' or '3' but seem a bit unnatural given the synth layering on them.Of course its the album closer thats the most famous 'In Your Eyes' is really the strongest demonstration of Gabriel's world music influences on this one its really a quite nice song admittedly it was played into the ground for a long time. Nonethless years later I've been able to enjoy it.Its a decent album. Gabriel's done better but this might be the best place to start. However for new fans I'd caution listening closely to the darker material like 'Mercy Street' and 'Don't Give Up' and see how that suits you its really more in line with Gabriel's other work than the pop songs are.

The duet with Kate Bush 'Don't Give Up' is impressive probably a little dragged out but worth listening to. Skip the boring 'Red Rain' track.

" I've been wanting this album for a very long time so I finally just got it! I really love Peter Gabriels voice! ",3.0
" This is the album where the dam burst open and Gabriel became a bona fide arena level superstar. Prior to the release of 'So' Gabriel had a solid loyal cult following of old Genesis heads and fans of his more sparse solo materiel. 'So' burst on the scene with the smash single 'Sledgehammer' and Gabriel's career was off to the races. A lot of people love this album and think it is the high point of Gabriel's career. For me it is the continuation of a downhill slide that would culminate in his next disappointing release 'Us' a few years later. 'So' is not a bad album but I don't think it is a great album either. Gabriel's timing just happened to be perfect as he exploited the use of the music video to promote the singles son this disc. Gabriel was a true pioneer in this regard and his videos for 'Sledgehammer' 'Big Time' and 'Don't Give Up' were truly groundbreaking for their time. It is just too bad that the actual songs were not as good as the videos were. Ok maybe I am being too harsh as these songs are all ok but compared to the deeper more thought provoking material of his earlier career much of this could be seen as fluff. The album does contain some great tracks however including the opener 'Red Rain' the brooding 'Mercy Street' and the closing love song 'In Your Eyes' which will forever be associated with the famous scene from the movie 'Say Anything'. 'So' is far from Peter Gabriel's best work but it is not his worst either. I would rate it around 3.5 stars as I find it a rather mixed bag. ",3.0
" This feature does have good qualities. The casting is spot on the cinematography great the character development good. It has the 'feel' of a good western epic. One doesn't get the impression that any corners were cut.Unfortunately the pacing is glacial. There just isn't enough story to fill the 193 minutes of screen time. Worse one of the story lines is wrapped up far too quickly despite the extensive build up it was given. The other story line conclusion is far more satisfactory but the wait seems interminable.In short this story could have been done on just one of the dvds.

Why they didn't program the firmware to work pulling those same formats off of the flash drive I have no idea but it is the main reason for the average rating.

" If you own Watermark Shepherd Moons The Memory of Trees or A Day Without Rain you already own this album. As much as I love the past work of Enya Amarantine breaks no new ground whatsoever.While Enya's continued work with Roma Ryan and Nicky Ryan is one of her strengths in terms of harmony of artistic vision it is also her greatest weakness on another level",3.0
" I was curious about Enya when I first heard of her; due to my love to U2's music and knowing that Enya became Irland's second biggest musical export after U2 (she's from Irland such a bad stereotype on my part).There's no way one's can deny her beautiful voice and remarkable style but I came to think that all her music has the same redundant theme when it comes to lyrics or music.This album reached the top 10 in both the UK and the US peaked at number 3 in Germany won the Grammy award for best new age album for 2007 and I'm in disbelief and trying to understand what is so special about this album.The reason I'm giving it three stars is that she is a hard working artist with glorious presence on the stage(at least she's not winking at the audience and acting cheesy like il Divo boys). With the inimitable style she has maybe it is expected to have a theme in all her albums but the lyrics of this album don't measure up to the standards she had in her other albums and they are either too repetitive and empty or just beyond my mental capacity. I'll go with the first choice; the lyrics are repetitive and empty. ",3.0
" I felt the words 'caged bird' were appropriate for the title of my review simply for the fact that I believe that Enya is a caged bird. Her creativity has been caged by monotony and the inability to try something new.If you want a sure and time-tested formula this is the album for you. Enya really does not re-invent the wheel. For a fan of her musicianship I think she is sadly held back by Nicky and Roma Ryan. She needs to assert herself more and find new songwriters. Amarantine? What the heck? Poor word choice and the song is sickenly dull. Amarantine the word doesn't even sound pretty. It doesn't feel right in a song either. Amarantine sounds like it should have belonged on Memory of Trees. Somebody Said Goodbye sounds like it could belong on Memory of Trees.The two best songs on the album are The River Sings and Water Shows the Hidden Heart. She sounds her best. The River Sings also helps to cut through the dull slo-mo of songs. They sound so similiar and run into each other. I also would like to say I hated Sumiregusa. I know this probably an ode to her Japanese fans. However her layered singing drowns out the beauty of the words.If you don't mind a lack of change and are an Enya fan I am sure you would love this album.If you haven't heard much of Enya's material and have never bought any of her CDs I recommend you stick to her first three albums - Celts Watermark and Shepherds Moon. They are her best work.She needs a new songwriter for starters. She also needs to experiment with instruments more. Her samples are getting old.I hate to be harsh but I am just not happy with her artistic offerings this time around. She has so much more potential.Finally I give her three stars simply for the fact that her voice is beautiful and her albums are always well produced. Beyond that this album really is a two. ",3.0
" Amarantine unlike all of Enya's previous work sadly underwhelmed me. It is a good listen but with a few exceptions I didn't feel I was hearing anything new. Enya's albums all have a distinct `sound' to them that which identifies them from the other albums. Not Amarantine.The good first. There are some great songs on Amarantine. 'It's in the Rain' the haunting 'Drifting' (the album's only instrumental) the furious 'The River Sings' the anthemic 'Less than a Pearl'... Amarantine has its winners. There's even the haiku-like 'Sumiregusa' entirely in Japanese which is a pleasant grower.However there are also some tracks which sound fairly it must be said unspectacular. 'A Moment Lost' and 'Amid the Falling Snow' are both such dull and uncreative tracks that I'm surprised that Enya put them on the album at all. Even the filler songs of The Memory of Trees were wonderful. That's the other thing what about the creativity in the instrumentation? You can really hear in each Enya album just judging from the sound what album it is. Not so with Amarantine. It lacks that special sound identifiable with itself. As good as the aforementioned tracks are Amarantine lacks that 'wow' factor which her other albums sport. Normally Enya's music transports you tugging at your heartstrings and mesmerizing you. I missed that feeling immensely when listening to Amarantine and it's a real shame.Another problem is one that lyricist Roma Ryan is responsible for. Three tracks are in the fictional language Loxian created by Roma herself. In the booklet each of these songs has the lyrics in Loxian as well as the English translation which is a welcome addition. However Loxian while beautiful to the ears has an alphabet completely unrelated to the Latin alphabet making following these songs lyrically impossible which is quite off-putting. There are also no songs in Enya's native Irish which is rather sad. Irish might have made some songs sound a bit more interesting.For those of you wanting more elaboration I will go deeper into each individual track.LESS THAN A PEARLA breahttaking composition with a moody and yet gloriously inspiring atmosphere. The chorus of vocals in the Loxian language weave a haunting layer of sound. A very strong way to open the album; definitely one of the best tracks.AMARANTINEThis is the first time the album's title track is not the opener and perhaps it was for the best here. 'Amarantine' is very plain and 'safe'. And the lovey-dovy lyrics just sound unimaginative on Roma Ryan's part. A sadly prophetic taste for what's to come.IT'S IN THE RAINThis is one track I am taken with; understated and low-key but steady. The melody is strong and gripping. A moody introspective track that has its own way of gripping the listener.IF I COULD BE WHERE YOU AREThis song's beauty is its simplicity - it's all vocal and strings and is a haunting thing in its own right. It reminds me of some of Enya's b-sides like 'I May Not Awaken' only more hopeful and stirring.THE RIVER SINGSThe first track I was truly taken with - an energetic fast and feisty song with a gorgeous thunderous sound. It's especially a pity here that you can't really follow the Loxian lyrics because it's another of the strongest tracks on the album.LONG LONG JOURNEYNot one of the album's worst songs but it's to thank its charm and catchiness that it gets away with its painfully unimaginative sound.SUMIREGUSAAnother winner slow and dripping with atmosphere. The haiku-like lyrics in Japanese are very moving.SOMEONE SAID GOODBYEMaybe it's just because of the pure melancholy of this song but I've never been able to really warm up to it. It divides people but I think it's one of the best English-language tracks on the album in that it weaves a mood so far removed from what one might potentially expect from Enya's work. I see some of Enya's emotion seep through here.A MOMENT LOSTSpeaking of things you can expect this song is so plain and unimaginative that it borders on plain boring. It doesn't even sound fully composed. Waste of disc space a dire song.DRIFTINGNow we're talking. Perhaps my biggest personal favourite; a gorgeous pristine instrumental (which this album could definitely use more of). The cello running through helps make this melody downright goosebump-inducing. This is magic and proves once again that Enya doesn't need lyrics if the music is strong in its own right.AMID THE FALLING SNOWThis song took me a long time to warm up to. If anything it has a great chorus and the final thirty seconds are very appealing. But the lyrics don't tell me anything really and the melody is fairly dire in retrospect.WATER SHOWS THE HIDDEN HEARTFor a closer this is a fairly anticlimatic song in the sense that for such a lyric-central melody you can't follow the lyrics in question. And the melody while nice and soothing isn't strong enough to be a closer. While this is a moving song it has to be the weakest closer to any of Enya's albums.Amarantine is certainly Enya's poorest release but it still has it good songs to speak of. The principle flaw as I see it is the sing-songy element in a lot of the songs; I miss the powerful melodies that were above that. As it stands we've heard it all before and portrayed much stronger than here. The artwork ironically illustrates the album perfectly; a whole lot of dull whites with some delicious reds thrown in. And Winter Came... would see Enya return to form but Amarantine is strictly for Enya's most devoted fans. ",3.0
" The reason for the three stars is there is nothing new on this CD. They should have titled it Greatest Hits of Enya and been done with it. I'm not saying the songs are terrible; I'm just saying I already have all the music on prior CD's. Buy it if you are a first time person listening to Enya. ",3.0
" I first heard 'Orinoco Flow' in a department store at the tender age of twelve and have been bewitched ever since by the sheer magic of Enya's music. I can think of no singer I admire or love more and with the possible exception of Loreena McKennitt no one whose music can touch so many different emotions. So I was thrilled when 'Amarantine' was released and popped it into my CD player the first chance I got expecting to be bewitched again. And it truly saddens me to say that I wasn't.Don't get me wrong - it's not a bad CD. I would still rather listen to 'Amarantine' than Hilary Duff any day. But given the choice between 'Amarantine' and 'A Day Without Rain' there's no question that my choice would be the latter. The truth is 'Amarantine' feels like a rehash of 'A Day Without Rain' and not a very inspired one either. The parallels are easy to draw. 'It's in the Rain' is 'Wild Child' 'Long Long Journey' is 'On My Way Home' (okay not on 'A Day Without Rain' but that's what it sounds like) 'Amarantine' is 'Flora's Secret' and 'Someone Said Goodbye' is 'One By One.' And with the partial exception of a few tracks ('Someone Said Goodbye' and 'Less Than a Pearl' for example) they all lack that unnameable quality that can tug at your heart like nothing else.Granted it is interesting to compare the parallel songs. 'Someone Said Goodbye' stands out particularly because it takes the exact opposite stance from 'One By One.' Where that song's refrain was 'Don't say goodbye' this one asks 'Is there a reason why you never want to say goodbye?' It helps that of all the album's songs 'Someone Said Goodbye' sounds the most like Enya inspired Enya at her best. Too many of the other songs suffer from either not-very-compelling music or lyrics far more pedestrian than we're used to hearing that pull the music down. I love Enya for her ethereal music her entrancing voice and lyrics like those in 'Only Time' - lyrics that mean something. Words like 'I wonder how you can endure/All I've said all I say to you' sound out-of-place on an Enya CD. Let me say it again",3.0
" I have been long awaiting this new album and was very happy to see that Enya had come out with a new album but when I put it on to listen I was a little bit disappointed in what I heard. As always there is some beautiful tracks. My favorite being track #3 but some of the songs are just dull and sound all alike. As always Nicky Ryan's lyrics are beautiful but many are very contrived and pop like. The album is missing the warmth that the Celts or Shepard Moons or even A Day With Out Rain had. It is missing that beautiful dreamy celtic sound that was once there. In some ways it seems that Enya has sold out to the more mainstream pop market which disappointments me a bit since I orginally turned to Enya to escape this kind of sound. Instead of buying this album I would recommend downloading some select songs from itunes and buying The Celts or Shepard Moons instead. ",3.0
" I hate to say this but Enya has run out of things to say. Even to the point that Roma Ryan has made up a fictional language to burble about. 'Amarantine' is something you've heard before and often. Even if it takes Enya five years between albums you get the vague impression that this was what you just listened to.Darn shame that. The billowing clouds of multi-Enya's singing like a blissed out choir were what made her great. There was no-one else out there that made songs anything like 'Orinoco Flow' or 'Storms In Africa.' But we're talking almost 20 years ago and 'Amarantine' just sounds like warmed over material. The songs all waft and drift and instead of inspiring bliss...they just vanish. Only the generic ballad 'Someone Said Goodbye' sounds like it could transcend the album we're listening to because this all just runs into itself like cotton candy fluff for aging new-agers.Maybe it was too much to expect that Enya and her collaborators could maintain brilliance forever. But like sonic architect Enigma (or even going back to The Alan Parsons Project) eventually the striking original becomes the banal. Unfortunately that is what we have with 'Amarantine.' ",3.0
" At age 16 I purchased 'Watermark'. I was in 10th grade it was February 1989 and the type of music Enya was making was very different from everything else at the time. I saw the video for 'Orinoco Flow' on VH1 and was sold (as were my friends). Well I'm 33 now and cynical and jaded (as I was at 16 too). Enya doesn't fool me anymore. I might as well listen to 'Watermark' and 'Shepherd Moons' as listen to 'Amarantine' Enya's sixth studio album. They're all pretty much interchangeable. The only reason her last album 'A Day Without Rain' sold over 6 million copies was due to a strange coincidence of 9/11 and a remix of 'Only Time' a version that wasn't even on that album. I hated the remix and I thought how cliche that the American public while in mourning and shock would turn to 'Only Time' of all songs (after all 'A Day Without Rain' had been out for almost a year with no notice).So 'Amarantine' like all of Enya's other works is soothing and pure escapist new age music. As with all of her albums it's pick and choose amongst the songs. I thought the title track 'Long Long Journey' 'Sumiregusa' and 'Someone Said Goodbye' could all be included on a new Enya best of compilation (which I could make since I own all of her albums). To listen to 'Amarantine' all the way through its 45 minute length is truly no different than listening to her other albums.I like Enya but I am artistically disappointed by her stubborness to NOT try anything new musically. She uses the same songwriters and producers for each album and makes one new release every five years (the real reason for this must be because she wouldn't sell the same model of car every year consumers would get suspicious!) In this way she hoodwinks the public because every five years the general public has forgotten who she is and therefore there is a new flock of sheep who have never heard of her to buy her music.How many more years will Enya continue to recycle her past work? She's a multi-millionaire now why not try something completely different? What has she got to lose at this point? My three star rating mean average folks. It's okay but nothing new or great. I'll be here in another five years to say the same thing (you can still read my post five years ago about her last album 'A Day Without Rain'!) ",3.0
" After listening to the samply of this CD I must agree with others Reviewer this CD is a disappointment.The lyric is not as good as before and too many repeated. Although the music is new but it need more to make me want to buy the CD.Enya is one of the best artist I know but are we buying her reputation or just the music itself? I am not buying anything just because of someone's reputation I pay my money for what I like. And this album is just not my cup of tea. ",3.0
" ...but I don't feel that I've added a lot to my collection by purchasing this CD. Unless I'm reading the lyric insert as I listen I have trouble remembering which album I'm listening to!

" As a long time Enya fan (starting with the ground breaking album Watermark) I found Amarantine to be a let down as there is nothing new here that has not been heard before on her previous albums. In Amaratine it appears that Enya has finally run out of new concepts. After a long break from her last album I was anxiously looking forward to new material along the lines of Shepard Moons or The Memory of Trees. Watch out for what you wish for as that is what we got. This in no way diminishes the work Enya has produced to date as I still enjoy her previous albums I simply wish that Amarantine had continued the tradition of unique surprises. ",3.0
" I've collected everything worth having of Enya's even a lot of her singles (that means selections with a lot of duplication which renders having ALL of her work not worth the money) and decided I had to have this album as soon as I saw it was coming out.Unusually for Enya you don't get any Latin or Gaelic on this CD you get three Loxian tunes (I think I've read that this made up language has some Lord of the Rings Inspiration) and one in Japanese (Sumiregusa). I think that the overall tone of the CD is somewhat slower than past efforts it's more of a backgrond music album to my way of thinking because of this.It might not be the album for a new Enya listener to start with but established fans will find a lot to like here. I don't consider it to be Enya's best but Amarantine is much better than most CD's out there it is worth owning. I only hope she doesn't wait 5 years for the next one. ",3.0
" it's enya therefore it can't be below 3 stars... but it just doesn't excite me except for 'sumiregusa' 'the river sings' and the opening track. those three are BEAUTIFUL. the rest is slightly different than what she's done before in that it's average-sounding. it's like music for people in their late 50's rather than dreamy music for everyone. ADWR was dreamy but boring. this is just boring. i can't get into this one but i still don't hate it. maybe time will change my opinion... ",3.0
" I found this CD disappointing -- partly because most of the tracks are dreary and downbeat and even worse they ring annoyingly in my head!

" I'm listening to a song now from the album in the hope that it will inspire me to write kinder things about the album Amarantine by Enja.This is new age which means 'voice layering synthesized backdrops and reverberations' according to Wikipedia which probably serves the same purpose of sunglasses--to hide many sins. A voice without range can go on forever. Nevertheless the melodies are soothing especially in a beautifully decorated main room with a roaring fire in a Vermont Bed & Breakfast. The sound can be captivating even if the words seem like Neil Diamond songs with no rhyme or reason. I find the melody especially of the feature song to be pleasing. It's great to listen to by a roaring fire but in my apartment that would mean the bookshelf or the curtains were going up in which case I would be in definite need of soothing. The words on the other hand can almost put me in a bad mood with their lack of message and repetition once twice three times a",3.0
" Thanks to a national catastrophe that is 9.11 Enya's A Day Without Rain soared on the charts selling some 7 million copies with some clever mixing of Only Time which saw sentimental Americans embracing the song giving her her first ever American Top 10 hit.Now some 4 years later Enya returns with Armarantine which fans have been waiting for with bated breath. The result? Amarantine is brief and typical Enya but the fact is that most tracks suffer from the fate of being rather indistinctly slow and unmemorable. And it has finally come to show that Enya's formula might already be wearing too thin for its own good.However all is not lost. The sublime and uplifting The River Sings is good reason why we still hold faith in Enya giving us something spirited. And there is Sumiregusa the Japanese haiku-inspired track used in a Panasonic ad that drove fans to a frenzy speculating her new album would be out soon last year. Having said that the track is beautifully serene and placid. The instrumental Drifting is befitting as part of a score for some major motion picture due to its lushness.Amarantine isn't going any where near Shepherd Moons or any of her previous albums but it'd still give Enya a decent run anyway. Not bad for a woman who sold 50 million records by shielding away from any limelight and putting out records at her own whim and fancy. ",3.0
" I have all Enya's albums but this one is simply not as good as any of her previous ones. ",3.0
" I have been a fan of Enya since I was 14. Ever since then I got hooked to her music and even Clannad's. I find that Amarantine is very mild by her standard. There is something to do with the order of her songs. The first song 'Less than a pearl' gets off on a good start. Unfortunately the hit song 'Amarantine' is second in line and it just ruins your appetite for every songs right after that. My recommendation would be put your CD player on RANDOM. It feels much better to listen to few other good songs before you finally reached 'Amarantine'.When you purchase this album you will enjoy the authenticity in Enya's voice. You know nobody can sing it like her and that's exactly what you are paying for. Amarantine lacks the effect of giving you goosebumps and that's very hard to come by when we are talking about Enya. But it does reduce the craving for the past five years since Days Without Rain. This CD will make a great stocking stuffer and that's only because the recipient will appreciate that he/she doesn't have to pay money for it. ",3.0
" Well I've heard both sides of the story here about this album. Some say it's horrible and predictable and others say that it's really great. I personally think that it's in the middle. It's not horrible because they're using the old Enya sound still - which is a really good sound but they're not really progressing much in any direction. It reminds me of alot of other bands that come up with a good sound but don't want to venture out of it. Why? Well in this case - I think it's because they don't have any ideas as to where to go. And well now looking at the sales chart for this why would someone want to make the effort when instead you can put out stuff like your older material and hit #1 on sales charts? Although it's really sad to see Enya have to take 5 years to produce this because I really doubt that all 5 years were spent writing this...it's just not that groundbreaking. Now if they had come out with something really different - but still Enya - then I could see the 5 years but it's really annoying to wait for that large amount of time just to see new material be alot like 'A Day Without Rain.'In any case - I can say that this album will please devoted Enya followers or if you're new to Enya but liked ADWR....but if you're someone like me who doesn't enjoy purchasing the same album twice - I'd recommend just buying her older stuff if you don't have it already and enjoying that. Or if you want a few new moderately good songs from Enya just download them off of itunes because since hearing this album from a friend - I came to the conclusion that if I had bought that album I would feel a bit ripped off and as if I could have just spent 3 or 4 dollars on itunes downloading the few standout songs.In conclusion - this is not groundbreaking or a standout album but rather - it's just average and will probably get boring the next time that I listen to it.

" I've been an Enya Fan for many years now and enjoyed all her previous releases and singles and the COllections immensely but this Album I found real dissapointing sorry.

" I purchased this album on the day it was released. I was absolutely thrilled as it had been several years since 'A Day Without Rain' and I was eager to sample the fresh material of 'Amarantine.' Sadly I was disappointed. I only listened to the album once or twice before tucking it in my car's CD holder and not touching it. Very recently I decided to pull it out and give it a second chance with my newly-lowered expectations.The one thing that I dislike most about this album is that there's nothing that makes it distinguishable from other Enya albums. In the past all of Enya's albums have had their own distinct themes (ex. the melancholy moods of 'Shepherd Moons' the glorious exotic vibrance of 'The Memory of Trees'). With 'Amarantine' there is nothing distinct. At best it's a collection of dewey-eyed love songs and sounds mostly like a bunch of b-sides filler tracks and throwaway cuts from previous albums. Heck even the album artwork is boring and ordinary something I'd never expected from Enya.One thing I've discovered is that it is mainly the older fans who dislike this album. I would probably be considered an 'older fan.' I have all of Enya's albums including the fabulous 'Only Time' boxed set and yet this is the first album to really disappoint me. The disappointment lies not so much in the music but in the lyrics which are absolutely dreadful. One comes to expect lush storytelling and thoughtful meditations from Enya's lyrics... but with 'Amarantine' the listener is left with shallow immature romantical notions and constant repititions. One can only use the words 'heart' 'tears' and 'love' so many times before they become nails-on-chalkboard cringeworthy.Here are my thoughts on each individual track",3.0
" I never thought I would ever find myself using the term 'Disheartening' to describe Enya's work. I have been a near obsessed fan for as many years as I am old just about. I have all ofher imports her box-sets her VHS and DVD's... and unlike any other artist who decides to make we wait between 5-8 painstaking years for something new- I always found it was worth the wait.Until Amarantine. I cannot even begin to express my extreme disappointment in this Album. It's apparentfrom reading other reviews I am not alone in this. I don't want people to forget that Enya actually consists of three people... Enya herself the vocalist and instrumentalist Nicky Ryan the producer and Roma Ryan the poet and lyracist.It should be apparent to everyone that the problem with this latest work is *not* Enya herself. If anything her voice is the heavenly powerhouse it always has been andher English has improved tremendously. No longer should we Enya fans have to translate for our friends who sit stumped over the words. The words that Roma Ryan weaves still conjur up majestic images and longing emotions that spin tales leaving us breathless. She is a lyrical genius. The problem is Nicky Ryan who seems no longer capable of challenging Enya herself musically. In fact with Amarantine we here her in various themes influenced by their previous outing 'A Day WIthout Rain' specifically threads of their worldwide smash 'Only Time.' Perhaps Nicky was hoping to mimic that success unfortunately it fell entirely short of even modest Enya fans.What wrong with this Album? Thetracks seem simply exploitive of Rnya herself. They could be crap and we'd still purchase it. 'Long Long Journey' is far to reminiscent of a child's tune like London Bridge Is Falling down... with the traditional Enya-esque Ooh's and Ahh's thrown in for continuity. 'It's In The Rain' has lovely lyrics (Typical of Roma) but he theme to which it's set diminishes it's potential beyond redemption. Of course you will hear threads of their first outing 'The Celts.''Sumiregusa' a japanese inspired song was released actually last summer and used in a panasonic commercial. While it's etheral quality and overall beauty got fans all over the globe excited about the forthcoming album it was overwhelmingly sad to see it included on the album for one would presume with over 5 years between the last album and this one more tracks could have been completed and ready for inclusion. 'Sumiregusa' and the reaction to it must have made them think we would have liked to have heard it on the album instead of as a single- which was even made available on Enya's website long before the release.'Amarantine' isnot without it's small gems though. The two best tracks on this Album are 'Someone Said Good-Bye' and 'Water shows the Hidden Heart' both of whish sshowcase Enya's vocal capability and Roma's lyrical savvy. Aside from that nothing on this album will have you singing along nothing echoes the Enya quality to which we have grown accustomed to and finally nothing is remotely as memorable as any of the track on her previous albums.Perhaps the most frustrating fact is while most of us die-hard fans accept the extraordinary amount of time between albums (So much time that most other musicians complete 2 or 3 albums.) but what is hard to accept that after the sour reception of this stinker we'll have to wait until 2010 before we get to see if this is just a blooper or in indeed the quality of Nicky's production skills are going downhill. ",3.0
" While `A Day Without Rain' was Enya's summertime album so to say and provided a refreshing change from her usual sombre fare it was a relatively safe affair that really offered nothing new and verged on being mediocre and harmless. `Amarantine' doesn't completely recover from the signs of creative strain already showing in her previous outing but familiar tones from albums past particularly `Watermark' and `The Memory of Trees' will provide something satisfying for existing fans even if this work isn't the best way to be introduced to a songstress who has proven herself many times and better at that before.It stings a little to say that `Amarantine' contains material that doesn't bring itself above the meagre quality of filler but sadly it does. Dreary ballads with almost monotonous melodies and lacklustre arrangements like `It's in the Rain' `I Could Be Where You Are' and `A Moment Lost' contribute nothing to the album other than demonstrating the very worst that Enya's compositions can be should the creative sensibilities that she's exhibited frequently in the past leave her. `It's in the Rain' in particular is an example of how her signature sound of synthesised instruments and vocals could become dated dangerously soon. The title track is a by-the-numbers Enya song that is a highlight inasmuch as it is the title track. It is bland while pleasant and would be unsurprisingly found as a forgettable number on `A Day Without Rain'.Other songs are perhaps best described as shifty. `Someone Said Goodbye' is hummable but plays like a bluesy pop song running on strings instead of drums. The use of a novel language does nothing to help `Sumiregusa' and `Amid the Falling Snow' sounds like it belongs on a compilation of alternative Christmas carols. The lyrics on the entire album are mostly trite and repetitive I'm sorry to say and whatever attempts they make at creating a resonant emotional core fail quite embarrassingly. Even excerpts in Loxian from Roma Ryan's book read like nothing more than faux-philosophical musings that seem to settle for thinking that they cannot go wrong by making convenient references to mystical images and ultimately simplistic metaphors.But the Loxian songs do stand out on this album and it's a pity that there are only three. Be it the sheer invention of the language or the premises that are depicted in it Enya and her team appear to have been intrigued somewhat by Roma Ryan's conception which seems to have revealed to them undiscovered creative spaces. That is a treat precisely because it's what listeners know Enya does best - charting new creative realms and building on them with her music. It's in the exploration of new worlds which always appeals to the imagination that Enya and her song-writing duo shine. `Less Than A Pearl' is an assured and quietly sublime opening matched by a relatively epic conclusion on `Water Shows the Hidden Heart' that plays comfortably with its occasional classical-sounding tinges. `The River Sings' is perhaps the best track on the album absolutely riveting and displaying sheer adventure in the mix of beats and vocals. More importantly it shows what's distinctive about Enya and that quality surely comes in no small part from her experiences with Clannad - which isn't a bad thing at all as `Watermark' and `Shepherd Moons' showed. It's a wonderful feeling when you know a song was simply inspired in its composition and `The River Sings' celebrates that with an easy comfortable and sparklingly energetic groove. In addition one should not forget `Drifting' the only instrumental piece which is a master class in how the unremarkable can be remarkably stirring. One doesn't feel the sting of pity from the lack of a trademark piano tune typically featured in her other albums.But even after an affecting finish one is still inclined to think that `Amarantine' isn't quite amaranthine (and yes - it's spelt with an `h'). While not quite as unmemorable as `A Day Without Rain' threatened to be a disturbingly contemporary creative headspace seems to have taken over - indeed since her previous work - depriving `Amarantine' of the unique sound that's come to be associated with Enya - romanticised ethereal echoes of the past that allow olden beauty to reach across the centuries and become truly transcendent by resonating with our hearts in our time. There isn't even really anything here that bears her beloved Celtic touch and that is woeful. `Amarantine' is quite pitifully less than a pearl and little more than a memory of what's been done much much more proficiently before.

" Yes I know all artists grow and change and I am still a devoted Enya fan. But i have to confess I like her earlier work much more. I'm a little bothered by the sing-songy trend I see emerging in her work. I'm not getting the powerful larger than life images in my mind like i did with her first three CD's. This comes across more as Enya Lite. give me the old style massive sound I fell in love with years ago. ",3.0
" I've been a devoted Enya fan my whole life and after A Day Without Rain I eagerly awaited the next release for five years.The first thing I noticed when I listened to Amarantine was that Enya has changed over the years since ADWR. Most of the songs have an odd singsong-y quality to them that was not present in her previous work. The songs by and large have simpler melodies and I was disappointed by the lack of complexity. Enya's music normally entrances the listener and creates a state of mind all its own. I had great difficulty getting into that state with this album. In a way the songs reminded me of a small child more skipping around and 'me' focused than before. Many of the lyrics don't fit the melodies as they should and a lot of the lyric songs sound more as if they should have been instrumental pieces. I believe there was only one non-vocal piece on Amarantine and if some of the songs with lyrics had been left as instrumental pieces the album as a whole would have been more appealing.On to the good points songs like 'It's In the Rain' and 'The River Sings' evoked more of the feel of A Day Without Rain and Enya's older sound in general capturing the slightly mournful melodies in 'It's In the Rain' and the characteristic and energizing chants in 'The River Sings.' I hope that whenever Enya releases another album (and I hope that it will not be another five years) it will fall more along the lines of the music on A Day Without Rain. Overall this album sounds somewhat experimental and I hope that through this experiment Enya finds the best music she can produce. ",3.0
" Like so many other reviewers I too am a HUGE fan of Enya's and own all her albums listen to them regularly and have been long awaiting the release of a new album! Five years without a new Enya CD is a very long time so excitedly I purchased this CD the day it was released. First time listening to it I was indeed disappointed. It sounded as if--for all the talent that Enya has--that she has suddenly reduced her songs to a limited range of 4 or 5 notes up and down the scale---over and over and OVER again! Talk about monotony! Now however as I've listened to the CD about 15 times I'm beginning to hear more depth to the pieces and I'm starting to enjoy the CD more with each listen. I definitely feel that this CD is an 'acquired taste' and that it takes time and SEVERAL LISTENS to enjoy it. I unabashedly feel that this is NOT Enya's best work! One would think that after five dry years she would produce something really fantastic especially since there's only 12 songs on this CD. Like so many other reviewers have mentioned each song seems to sound so much like other Enya songs from the past--or worse like other songs on THIS very CD as they all tend to blend together and sound so much alike that you can't quite tell where one ends and another begins. That said however now that I've listened several times I'm beginning to appreciate it a bit more and can actually admit to LIKING several of the songs. (I am however still trying to figure out the NEED for a fictional Loxian language no matter how pleasant-sounding it might be....Can't we just stick to English and Gaelic?) I suppose my favorite song is 'The River Sings' because of its refreshing upbeatness in--what seems like--an otherwise sea of slothfulness (although I'm still trying to figure out the NEED for a FICTIONAL language [i.e. Loxian] on this CD no matter how pleasant-sounding it may be. Can't we just stick to English and Gaelic? Why the need to make one up for a music CD such as this? Afterall this music is NOT the soundtrack to a movie like Lord of the Rings...) For personal reasons I've become very attached to the song 'If I Could Be Where You Are' because when I listen to the song I think of my Mom who is in heaven and I wish I could 'find a way to bring her back home'. The hymm-like quality of this song coupled with the lyrics is very moving to me but as I said for personal reasons.(At the risk of repeating myself--but then why not? Enya surely does it....) so much of this CD is repetitive and redundant and it seems a bit like 'leftovers'. For example The song 'Long Long Journey' could well be titled 'On My Way Home Part II' and 'Somebody Said Goodbye' (the MOST redundant song on the CD) could be 'One by One",3.0

It seems as if Whyte lost his train of thought here or was himself bored with the telling of the Camulod tale. Either way his editor needs a kick in the rear for letting this one be published as is.For those who are reading the series and haven't yet gotten to this one I do suggest you read it just to keep following the story to the end but I finally resorted to skiming paragraphs/pages just to get through the really boring parts.Very disappointing this book is.

" I loved the first four books of Whyte's Camulod Chronicles but apparently he lost his way in Fort At River's Bend (book 5). Now in Sorcerer he has recovered quite a bit but still fails to hold a candle to his previous works.Finally Whyte resolves dozens of our expectations and dangling questions. Certain characters have died as we knew they must. Camulod is becoming less Roman and more like the Arthurian Britain we all know. Merlin has now become the sorcerer and Arthur has pulled the sword from the stone and become King of all Britain.Unfortunately the manner in which he did all this... left me far from impressed. While Whyte had spent immense detail on every little meaningless event in previous books he then chaotically rushed through these MAIN events we have been waiting for since The Skystone.It's a shame but after six books- I am no longer interested in how this series will turn out.

" The Freud edge banding system occupies a unique niche between the household iron and multi-thousand dollar (aka 'real production') edgers. So far as I can tell it's the only option for semi-professional production of heat-set edge banding.I find it a highly compromised tool. As the old National Geographics used to say it's in a land of problems and promises. Conceptually it's a darn good idea. The execution could be a whole lot better.Let's look at edge banding for a minute. It's not much thicker than a business card (exclusive of adhesive)and only fractionally wider than the wood it is applied to. It takes a fair amount of heat to soften the glue. The guide system on a bander needs to hold material flat square and unbowed although everything that is being done previously almost guarantees the opposite.The EB100 sometimes does the trick. There's only so much precision one can expect from stamped steel guides. When the machine works it's a lot faster than the household iron. When it doesn't it's hard to resist the temptation to throw the sucker out the window. Although one can remove improperly applied edging it takes more effort than to apply it by hand in the first place.Freud should improve the guide system and the table on the EB100 to make it a truly useful machine. Machined precision guides would are necessary for this operation. And they shoud re-think using heat-set banding on a machine table that is subject to high temperatures. After 20 minutes of operation the front edge of the table peels up. This doesn't impair function it just looks like hell.I know woodworkers that get excellent results from this system. Despite significant experience with precision machinery I can't duplicate their results. Maybe if I were more skilled I could. I am uncomfortable with a machine that makes me guess continually. ",3.0
" This product worked well enough on a recent project that the customer was quite satisfied with the result. On the flip side since this item will only apply pre-glued hot melt adhesive product I'm finding the usefulness limited to white black or unfinished birch edgeband.

Since I can't seem to find anything other pre-glued edgeband I find it's use limited. ",3.0

This album is 'Unwritten Law gone So-Cal pop.' On the bright side there are some catchy tunes and a couple of decent but pop-y party songs. On the down side it is not what you'd expect after listening to 'Elva' ",3.0
" Credit veteran SoCal rockers Unwritten Law with putting the sex drugs and rock'n'roll back into punk rock a scene that's been growing progressively straightedge polite and well --bland. The `Law is upholding the immoral fibers that have held true rock'n'roll together while creating dark edgy catchy rock with an ever-present ballsy bravado.Tired of the prepubescent vocals that have plagued punk rock? Fear not `Law frontman Scott Russo's surpassed puberty and developed some of most unmistakable and raspy pipes in music.Guitarists Steve Morris and Rob Brewer's grunge-tinged distorted and power-chord sprinkled strummings compliment Russo's vocals perfectly. Pat Kim provides sinisterly smooth basslines and new drummer Tony Palermo keeps the beat going with ruthless ferocity.With its soaring vocal and instrumental melodies infectious hooks and captivating tempos and guitar effects the `Law's sixth release 'Here's To the Mourning' is arguably their most cohesive and well-rounded offering to date.The first single released from 'Here's To' the soaring anthemic 'Save Me' is already enjoying its top-10 perch atop the alternative chart while its video is enjoying substantial rotation on MTV2 VH-1 and Fuse.'Save Me' isn't the only standout track the album boasts. The soaring sing-a-longs 'Celebration Song' 'Because of You' and 'Walrus' the Prozac frenzied 'Hide Away' the funky 'I Like the Way' the stop-and-go 'She Says' and the hard-nosed tracks 'Get Up' 'Lost Control' and 'Rejections Cold' are all radio-friendly tracks itching for radio airplay.While they may never ride the airways the highly energized and roughly anthemic 'F.I.G.H.T.' and hidden track will beat you over the head steal your wallet and kick the cane out from under your grandfather without a second thought.The `Law had us 'Seein' Red' in 2002. With a new hit single and an addictive album they should be seein' continued success in 2005. Now what they do with the added income is anyone's guess. But if their lyrics are any indicator it'll be something illegal...Sounds Like",3.0
" The Good'Get Up transfuses heavy riffs meaty bass lines and tuneful vocals that are on the verge of whining. More of that thunderous bass along with catchy rhythms can be heard on 'Celebration Song'. On 'Lost Control' Brewer and Morris whip out some rapid-fire fretwork while Russo proves you can't go wrong with a whoh-whoh chorus in punk song. 'Save Me' is the band's first single which was co-written with Linda Perry (Courtney Love Pink). It starts off with a subtle drum and bass line that leads into driving distorted riffing. The bridge section mixes up the tempo with a brief ska-type rhythm.Unwritten Law mix it up even more with some funky seventies style guitar twang on 'I Like the Way'. Russo's vocals are strong and empowering as he reaches the lively chorus. 'Rejection's Cold' has an infectious opening lick that endures throughout the track. 'F.I.G.H.T.' had to be written with the thought of becoming a high school football anthem. It opens with a riff that's sure to get your blood pumping and the chorus is delivered by a group of cheerleaders; F-I-G-H-T! Be sure to stick around for the impressive bonus track that rounds out the album.The BadNothingThe VerdictIf you have a song co-written by Linda Perry you're not exactly a punk group. However Unwritten Law seem to fit in well with the new pop-punk movement that's taking over the rock radio scene. Here's to the Morning is loaded with plenty of high-energy anthems that never let up.

" Average. I've been listening to Russo and the boys for solid for three days after getting my mitts on 'Here's to the Mourning.' It's evident like on 'Elva' that the band has undergone some significant changes since hitting the low-end of 90's mainstream California punk rock. In Elva's footsteps the band (or possibly Russo) sings of depression dissatisfaction and addiction. Walrus' 'Everything gets old / everyone is dumb / so i keep changing / everything is gay everyone is fakeso i can't hang around' has me sadly missing self-titled's careful attention to music feeling and ambiguity. 'Hide Away' has Russo chanting 'slow dance take a chance with me / take off your pants with me' and the music often feels unexplored and void of depth.While chalked full of accurate depictions of Russo's sentiments on life the music is uncomfortably hammered into a poppy radio-friendly version of angst punk making the sound and content uncomfortable for lovers of older UL material.The hooks are there and your foot will tap but you'll quickly tire of the lyrical content Russo's new affinity for F-words to fill gaps his depressive tones and lack of sound variety that even Elva managed to contain. First timers and 'Save Me' radio spin-offs would be better off starting with the self-titled CD or Elva. ",3.0

People disappear or need urgent psychiatric treatment and as a hostess for satans ball Woland chooses Margarita who willing accepts in order to free and be with the Masteran oppressed author of a novel about Pontius Pilate...Written during Stalins infamous show trials Bulgakov's use of magic realism does invoke the climate of enforced thinking and terrorand in turn satarises the drabness and tedium of soviet life but for me this book just doesn't shine. Its no '1984' or 'Gullivers Travels' and neither does it give the joy of Garcia Marquez's use of the style. Yes I got the idea abour cowardicw being terrors greatest ally and there's plenty of qoutable scenes but you're often left wondering exactly is the point he is making.(The reading of the introduction and annotations are a must to keep the novel alive)The book was written re written and revised many times between 1928 and 1940 and as a result it does seem over egged. I was put in mind of Bernard Malamud's story about Feidelman whom on painting a masterpiece thought he could make it better and kept altering it so that in the end his masterpiece became a mess!'The Master and Margarita ' isn't a messbut it just doesn't pack the punch its reputed to do.

" Which is to say I dont think this novel compares to Lolita Mrs. Dalloway Gargantua and Pantagruel Wuthering Heights and The Stranger in literary quality. The horrific scenes of Satan's taking full advantage of human stupidity and avarice are stunning and entertaining--at least at first. Then they become redundant and tiresome. The second half of this novel suffers from the same flaw that Milton's Paradise Regained suffers. The latter is the story of absolute good winning over evil the former about absolute evil winning over good. Both stories are deficient in that the forces (either good or evil) are absolutely invincible; there is no question of their success thus no tension thus really no reason to go on reading. I found it difficult to plod through the second half of the novel principally because I knew that Woland would succeed would free the Master and Margarita would drive half of Moscow insane yadda yadda. This did not make for very interesting reading. Evil has a huge potential to be interesting because it is imaginative and energetic. Woland is imaginative and meticulous but after the first several hundred people he kills/drives mad fails to interest me in the second half of the book. Also the others of his retinue fail to develop beyond their initial presentations; they become repetitive rather than increasingly intriguing. How many times do we need to hear about Koroviev's check suit and flawed pince-nez or Azezallo's one fang? And I didnt think much of Behemoth's antics either; at first they were amusing (like his attempting to board a tram) but again it gets redundant after several chapters of the same. The structure of the novel is intricate but flawed in my opinion. For instance the epilogue was rather dry and unnecessary. I enjoyed the fanciful scenes of Margarita flying over the city and later on horseback the devil and his retinue flying through the cosmos. I especially enjoyed it after having to endure the seventy-fifth destruction of some part of Moscow by Woland and his band. Don't get me wrong I do think highly of Bulgakov's attempt at an intricate and ambitious novel. For the most part it is provoking especially when considering the atheist Stalinist Russia in which it was written. But I expected more of a crescendo. I didn't care for Woland. He was as interesting as one of the many MacBeth rambling soliloquy's. His ball was about as scarey as a typical halloween costume party. In fiction Satan can (and has) been much more interesting. The Master and Margarita's tale begins as touching but ends rather stale and predictably. To sum up the book succeeds and fails wildly. I would give the first half of the book five stars the second one and a half. Thus the final tally of three. ",3.0
" I was chatting with a chatroom friend who asked me if I had read this book. The chatmate who lives just outside Moscow said this book is very popular in Russia right now. His comment made me curious. I thought I'd read a couple of reviews on this book since I'd never heard of it. The reviewers said this is a great read so I ordered the book.I really didn't see the genius in this 'masterpiece.' I could follow the story line and had no problem with the Russian names but I wasn't able to even find a central plot to this book. I was really intrigued with Satan's ball in which Margartia was the naked hostess where all of the guests had to kiss her knee as they entered. After this I felt the story fell apart. I felt that this was the climactic moment in the story and this scene was in the middle of the book.I would recommend this book to someone who is studying Russian literature but this just isn't the kind of book that you will want to wrap yourself in a blanket and read on a rainy weekend.

" I bought this book because I was interested in a quick overview of the Cold War from which I could choose other books to fill in the gaps on topics that I find interest me. In that respect it is a decent book and I have purchased two other books to continue learning ('The Making of a Counter Culture' by Theodore Roszak and 'Blacked Out' by Alasdair Roberts).The problem with this book is that it has far too much of a 'good vs evil' theme. I would have liked to have seen more of a 'ideology vs ideology' or 'imperialist vs imperialist' theme which would have helped go beyond simple caricatures of the two nations.I was quite disappointed to see how much the book portrayed Gorbachev as an enlightened hero while only casually mentioning that he was quite hated in Russia. Also there was almost no mention of Solzhenitsyn - how is that possible?If you do decide to read this book I suggest you supplement it with the following to help balance things out",3.0

" If only Professor Gaddis had been able to completely clear his mind of leftist biases this would have been a true classic. Unfortunately Gaddis was unable to bring true objectivity to his otherwise excellent concise history of the Cold War.Gaddis repeats the false claim that Mao achieved his takeover of China without significant assistance from the Soviet Union. This is not true. The Soviet Union financed the Chinese Communist Party from its inception. Stalin's minions through the years trained many of the CCP cadres in the Soviet Union. When the Japanese surrendered the Soviets turned over many tons of armaments to the CCP. This bit of dishonesty of Prof. Gaddis' part is not small.With regard to Reagan Gaddis is honest enough to give partial credit to President Reagan for the collapse of the Soviet Union but he minimizes his part preferring to credit Pope John Paul for providing the main impetus. Likewise Gaddis takes up the leftist cant that the Soviet Union was ready to expire as if it were a pile of sand that needed only a few grains more on top to make it topple. This petulant refusal to grant credit where credit is due detracts from an otherwise fine historical study.Gaddis shows himself to be as much a slave to the left as was any of Stalin's minions. He blatantly states that 'once the liberation of [Kuwait] began early in 1991 Saddam Hussein found his military deployments so visible and therefore so exposed to attack that he had no choice but to withdraw.' This is one of the leftwing rationales intended to deny credit to George H.W. Bush Margaret Thatcher and the other leaders who were brave enough to confront those who supported the tyrant Hussein. Hussein kept his troops in place until they were practically surrounded at which point the troops panicked and tried to run. This kind of distortion should have been beneath Gaddis; alas it was not.Finally without exhausting the list Gaddis waves his politically correct credentials when referring to a comment by Karl Marx. Gaddis is at pains to refer to Marx's use of the 'sexist terminology of 1852' when he said that '[m]en make their own history.' Of what relevance to anything except doctrinaire left-wing political correctness is Gaddis' comment?There are numerous other tinged comments in Gaddis' work. It is a pity they exist because The Cold War could have been a truly excellent history. As it is it does provide a concise history of how the Cold War came to be how the struggle was fought and ultimately if inaccurately how the Soviet Union and some of its satellites threw off Communism. But The Cold War must be read with wariness because of its author's tendency to subtly shade the truth.Jerry ",3.0
" John Lewis Gaddis has done the general reader a service by writing a relatively short book about the entire Cold War period. Serious students and scholars will probably find themselves saying 'I am familiar with these events and Gaddis's take on them so why did I buy the book?' That is a fair question but the book does encapsulate the key points of Gaddis's interpretations of major issues so if one is seeking such an overview of the 1946-1991 era with a conservative tilt one could certainly do worse than The Cold War",3.0
" Simply spectacular. I only wish the book were twice as large and twice as detailed. There is so much to cover for example that the Cuban Missile Crisis receives only one page.Gaddis has written much on the cold war and this was for all intents and purposes his attempt to 'dumb it down' to a more accessible survey. In this he has succeeded and from here I will turn to his other more detailed writing on the period. ",3.0
" I bought this book with the expectation that it would provide a comprehensive overview of the events episodes personalities motivations and results of the Cold War. A reader looking for something similar might be disappointed. This book does not really attempt to be a comprehensive history of the Cold War but is rather a collection of chapters each devoted to a particular thematic aspect of the war. It reads as though Gaddis has a particular thesis about the Cold War that he wants to flesh out in each chapter rather than telling the whole story in an orderly narrative.As examples",3.0
" Given that this is a rather slim book (266 pages) to cover the Soviet/American rivalry that defined the world from 1945 to 1989 I suppose one could expect that it skims the surface rather than covers any aspect of the Cold War in depth.I just finished it and I feel like I read the Cliffs Notes version of a larger more complex book. Gaddis is reported to be working on a biography of George Kennan. Perhaps his energies are being put into that book. This certainly is not the definitive history of the Cold War. We're still waiting on that and the time for it may be about right.Several other reviewers commented on the truly wierd section in Chapter II where the book veers off into alternative history and I was certainly stunned and puzzled by it because it was so out of character with the rest of the book. But I wonder if more of that approach if it were better labeled would have actually helped. After all what was remarkable about the Cold War was what did NOT happen. ",3.0
" This is not your traditional linear account of events as we have come to know most other history books. This is a variety of asynchronos snapshots of key figures during the cold war and the people and events surrouding them.This format is interesting but not quite what I expected. There are a number of omitted events details background events that add color to the current story. Each chapter is a story unto itself so do not feel compelled to read this book in long sittings - here and there will get you through. Good commuting reading.I liked this book but I felt that Gaddis (or his editors) held back in the interest of selling more books. This is dissappointing.

" This book is written for laymen not specialists as explicitly state in the book's preface. Hence the question to ask does it succeed in this regard? The answer is in a very average way. By this this reviewer means that this book is pretty much not distinguishable from the large number of books written on the same subject. No new insights analyses or facts are offered that can break this book out from its myriad competition. Hence the average rating. If a reader is interested in such an average overview of the Cold War the book will perform as expected. It covers all the basics but with the problems cited above. In other words it is a useful introductory primer to the subject but nothing else. ",3.0
" I picked up this book because I wanted to have a greater understanding of the events of the Cold War. I grew up in the eighties so most of my memories are confined to the Reagan-Gorbachev era. I knew of the Berlin Wall Cuban Missile Crisis Korean War etc. but I didn't have a clear idea of the details surrounding these important events.Unfortunately while Gaddis' book is an easy read and provides fascinating analysis he seems to assume that the reader is already familiar with the events of the Cold War. For example the Cuban Missile Crisis is covered in about five pages and while the events are alluded to I still have no idea exactly what happened or when it happened how people reacted at the time etc. The author mentions the event and proceeds directly to the analysis.I have not finished the book yet and will probably not pick it up again until I read a more factually in-depth work on the Cold War. This is disappointing because the author states in the introduction that he wrote this book as a self-contained work on the Cold War intended for beginners. In that respect I think he has failed. ",3.0
" The book has a promising pedigree. Gaddis is a leading scholar on the Cold War known well for his effective teaching and the author of a very good general book on the first half of the Cold War. This book unfortunately comes nowhere near satisfying the expectations raised by its provenance. A significant problem with the book is its organization and length. The Cold War is structured as a series of roughly chronological essays on important aspects of the Cold War. Gaddis sometimes cuts back and forth chronologically and the amount of actual narrative history is relatively modest. Putting the essential narrative and analytic overview into a book of this length (slightly over 250 pages)would be difficult perhaps impossible and Gaddis has not even tried. The result consequently is that this book can be read easily only by people who already have some familiarity with the basic history of the Cold War. This is a major defect in what is supposed to be an introductory book. A somewhat longer book incoporating more narrative perhaps with summary devices like time-line charts would really be necessary for an introductory book.Perhaps because of the brevity of the book The Cold War suffers also from an overly restricted focus. What Gaddis presents is largely an account and analysis of US-Soviet relations particularly emphaszing the Washington end. There is no doubting the importance of this feature of the Cold War. But Gaddis leaves too schematic an impression of how events unfolded during the Cold War. A comparison with his prior general work We Know Now is instructive. In that volume he emphasized not only the importance of the US-Soviet relationship but also the crucial roles and relative autonomy of many other actors. To be fair its not that Gaddis doesn't mention this phenomena but it gets short shrift in this account. For example the crucial European role in initiating and nurturing the establishment of NATO which he discusses nicely in We Know Now receives one sentence in The Cold War. In another example of the excessive focus on Washington and Moscow Gaddis does discuss how the nature of Cold War allegiances often allowed secondary or minor powers to manipulate their relationships with the US or the Soviet Union but his emphasis in on how these actors affected the behavior of the US and Soviet Union rather than how their overall impact on events.The restricted focus of the book probably reflects also Gaddis' prior scholarly interests in the origins of the Cold War the nature of US policy and the US-Soviet relationship. Gaddis clearly drew from his prior books and while this probably made this book easier to write it has come with some cost. The best parts of The Cold War are the sections dealing with the earlier phases of the Cold War and the second half of the book is not nearly as good.Gaddis doesn't deal at all with one of the major features of the Cold War its often devastating effects in the Third World. Our (unavoidable) rivalry with the Soviets and the entanglement with proxy conflicts in many parts of the world often transformed localized low level conflicts into disastrous events. This is one of the major legacies of the Cold War and hardly dealt with in this book. Gaddis writes at some length (relative to the rest of the book) about the US support of democratic institutions as a key feature of the eventual triumph of the West. This applies with considerable justice to our policies in Europe and East Asia but in many other regions this was hardly true. Gaddis's discussion of these issues is shallow to non-existent.Probably the most controversial chapter will be the discussion of the end of the Cold War. I found this section somewhat superficial and overemphasizing the role of Western leaders like Reagan and Thatcher. To be fair Gaddis does not indulge in the triumphalist rhetoric of many American conservatives who see the Soviet Union bludgeoned into submission by Reagan but his treatment of Reagan is considerably more positive than some others. Raymond Garthoff's The Great Transition for example is a detailed analysis of US-Soviet diplomacy in this period and contains a considerably more negative assessment of Reagan.A good overview of the Cold War would be valuable but this book is not that volume.

" For the most part Dr. Crabb has aimed his book at Christian couples. And several things I can wholeheartedly agree with",3.0
" This is an amazing book using the term 'amazing' without necessarily meaning anything either positive or negative.Crabb promotes a Biblical idea of the difference in gender roles. He supports his points by scriptural reference by referring to his counseling and to common sense.If you don't like his goal if you have the modern view of such things this book will make your teeth hurt. Not only will his goals set your hair on fire he is above all plausible. He is not slick-plausible. He is a good writer and organizer of his material.For those who disagree even vehemently disagree with his views it would be an educational experience to deal with his book using logic and reason. Ripping it to shreds and jumping up and down on the scraps while screaming obscenities--which passes for scholarship in some fields--is not what I'm talking about. Deal with this book whatever your position with reason logic and fact and you will know more about among other things what you think and why you think it.I was particularly struck by his extensive investigation into how a wife's regard for her husband can build him up or ruin him. The same is mentioned in passing by other writers in the fiels but Crabb goes into some detail.Crabb spends the bulk of his time exploring marital issues. It appears to me that if men and women are to take gender-separate roles the manifestations of such differences would be in the workplace or in other groups. Crabb doesn't get into this. I expect that telling a woman to be a helpmate and to accept husband's decisions with a joyful and grateful heart is going to create some confusion when a woman is an equal colleague of a man at work or a supervisor. Then what?As I say worth reading if it doesn't change your mind in the slightest or if it does. ",3.0

However the book is very short and not particular about certain aspects and details of grammar and other nuances - for someone who NEVER spoke Yoruba and doesn't have anybody to ask for a clue it leaves a lot of questions unanswered - for this however there are hopefully other Yoruba textbooks.On the brighter note I would like to add that the book does a very good job in giving a little insight on Yoruba people and Yoruba culture in general. I would recommend it as a good start book for anyone who wants to learn Yoruba - you can't go wrong with it. ",4.0

" I purchased this game for my granddaughter who has been playing it with love for a few years ..she is now 7 and still loves to wash the dog ...have a parade and more. Fun little girl computer game. ",4.0
" Lately my 4 year old daughter has been obsessed with computer games. I'm buying more games on CDs to decrease her exposure to the internet. She loves animals so I figured this would at least be mildly interesting. That turned out to be an understatement. She fell in love with it instantly.There are four characters in the game and each has an animal friend. To play the game you have to prepare each character and their animal for a pet parade by teaching the animal a trick picking out clothes for the character and designing a float for each pair. After each pair and their float is ready for the parade you have to organize the parade and add special effects. Then you start the parade and the program plays out the parade that you designed. The parade is actually pretty brief but it can be played over and over as many times as you like.The game can be quickly mastered by most children but has enough variety to encourage them to go back to repeat the tasks many times. There are a variety of clothing choices and float options. Even though it seems repetitious to me my daughter doesn't seem to mind it - and she's very advanced with computer use. I've also noticed that when she goes back over and over to play the games where she teaches the animals their tricks for a specific parade the game increases in difficulty so it's not monotonous. There are also several options for printables including a cute friendship bracelet with your child's name on it.This game certainly would not qualify as educational although it does build good computer skills and hand/eye coordination. Overall I would say it's just good clean fun.I gave this four stars because sometimes the program seems a little slow and there is a delay between screen changes. Also you can't play the game without the CD in the disk drive even after fully loading the game on the computer. This is a negative to me because for most kids you would have to assist them with starting the game. However my 4 year old has pretty much mastered inserting the CD closing the drive drawer and clicking on the program icon. I'm just not totally comfortable with her doing it when I'm not there. The last thing I need is to have a broken CD jammed in my computer... ",4.0

" Amazing to learn that every Jaquith that you have ever met has descended from a single ancestor (Abraham Jaquith) who emigrated to the US in the 1600's as a Huggenot. Numerous Jaquith ancestors were patriots who fought and died for this country from the King Philip's War on. The only reason I did not give this family biography a 5 star rating is because some of the historical data in the living members of the Jaquith family is not correct.

" This is all-around a pretty good lawn book. However there are a few cases where the advice is a little outdated given the latest research on the subject.One is the subject of using a mulching mower; research has shown that using a mulching mower does not contribute significantly to thatch buildup. Finely chopped grass clippings from lawn grasses decompose very rapidly. I guess you might get in trouble if you have lots of aggressive weed grasses that grow extremely rapidly leaving much larger amounts of grass clippings. It is also possible that using a non-mulching mower could get you in trouble; it sounds like Mr. Baker might be using a reel mower which doesn't pulverize the leaves. The research that I have seen studied the effects of using a mulching mower on lawn grass only so if you have loads of tall weed grasses or are using a non-mulching mower you might have trouble.Another is the subject of aeration. From what I have read spike aeration (Mr. Baker recommends the use of those spike aerator sandal things) is not very effective. Core aeration which is admittedly more difficult and expensive is what gets the best results and is actually effective at controlling thatch.Here is one of the many pages on these subjects",4.0

It includes footage of the 'A Day Out with Thomas' event held at the Strasburg Railroad in Pennsylvania during which children selected their favorite episodes for inclusion in the video.Since the episodes contained in this DVD have been reviewed pretty thoroughly for the VHS version I won't comment too much on them.Both the image and sound quality on the DVD transfer are fairly good. The DVD programming however leaves something to be desired. You cannot skip the logos and ads at the beginning of the DVD nor forward through Sir Topham Hatt's introduction to the DVD features--at least not on my DVD player (I was able to skip and fast forward using WinDVD on the PC).The 'Bonus Features' are rather unexceptional.

I was fortunate enough to catch one of these outings a few years backs but since I am a parent of a child with a severe developmental disability I got more of a chance to 'experience' the day on the video than I did in person.Anyway this is a nice hour of Thomas magic and a good introduction to see whether Thomas is right for your child.

" This was definitely worth reading! I became a fan of Christine Feehan only a few months ago and I hope she continues to write often as I have enjoyed all of her novels so far. This story was very enjoyable and interesting. I enjoyed the interaction between the two main characters and also some of the secondary characters especially the children. It was a little predicatable but there is still a quality in Christine Feehan's writing that grabs you and keeps you interested... and wishing that it had not ended!The only compliants I have is that one of the brothers characters was undeveloped to the point that it did not make sense as well as the 'special gifts' that both the main characters had. The authors seemed to imply some power beyond ESP but yet never expanded or provided any sort of explanation for these 'gifts'.I am really looking forward to the next novel. I hope it will be a continuation (perhaps the Don's brother?) of this story. I am also still hoping for more vampire romances as well! ",4.0

" This was a great book. I have read several of Christine's Dark series so I knew that this would be a page turner and it was. This one is a gothic historical romance. It doesn't have Vampires or Carpathiansin it but the lack of those doesn't diminish this book one bit. This is the story of the village healer a beautiful girl names Nicoletta and the Fierce dark and cursed Don Giovanni Scarletti. Nicoletta comes to the Scarletti family home which is known by its nickname Palazzo della Morte or in English palace of death to help save Giovanni's young niece. She also has to treat him as he is ill also. She is strangly drawn to him even though she resists. After she returns to the village the Don envokes his right of choosing his bride from the villages on his land. She tries to hide but he finds her and makes her his bride. Together they must fight the evil that is threatening to kill them both and over come the Curse. There is many instances of humor and I found myself wanting to read more after the book was done. There are some very interesting secondary characters that I think would make good heros and heroines for possible future books. Get this book. You'll really enjoy it. ",4.0
" The Scarletti Curse is the story of a young and very innocent healer Nicoletta who is chosen to stand beside a powerful Don the Don Scarletti whom even the king feared. The story centers around the curse on the Scarletti's where the women they love end up dead and where most women who come to the Palazzo Scarletti die including Nicoletta's mother and aunt. Nicoletta (a healer) herself is chosen via bride contract by the Don Scarletti (a Telepath) and the story developed from there with many twists and turns. The characters were well developed and the story line kept you guessing until the end. I was so hooked that I finished it in one night the same night I got it through the mail.Christine has done it again. I picked up the 'Scarletti Curse' uncertain on what I would find. On one hand she has been consistent in writing books with great character development and great story lines in her 'Dark' series about the Carpathians. On the other this was a non-Carpathian book though a Gothic so I did not know whether she could make the transition. She made the transition extremely well and created another keeper for my keeper shelf.Christine has proven that she can write differently and Scarletti Curse was refreshingly interesting. I am anticipating and hoping that she will expand this into a series. (Spoiler here",4.0
" As a fan of gothic and paranormal stories this book appealed to me. True it had a lot more sex than Victoria Holt or other gothic writer favorites ever included in their books but it didn't take away from my enjoyment.Nicolette is a free spirit with a secret. She was born with the gift of healing and knowing when somebody needed her.The villagers depend on her healing skills and rally around her to keep her hid from outsiders. They know Nicolette could be burned as a witch otherwise. Don Giovanni the dark brooding aristocrat wants Nicolette the first time he sees her. Though his family lives under a curse that all of their women will die he is determined to make Nicolette his bride.I don't believe in giving too much information in a review so I won't say what happens between them. The book is very atmospheric with the castle and it's sinister wall carvings the brothers and grandfather who have all lost their wives and last but not least the hero with his own gift. One thing I liked about the hero is he was arrogant but not overly so. He had a soft gentle side that overshadowed his arrogance at least to me. I hate heros who are overly arrogant simply because they are men.This was my first book by this author and I am looking forward to reading Dark Prince another book I have by her. ",4.0
" I've really like Christine Feehan Gothic stories I have to admite that I had finish reading this book since June but haven't had the chance to write my review till now.This book is dark and mysterious which is filled with suspense and sensuality. Nicoletta is a very likable heroine with healing gift's .She embrace life with such open arms and feet ( you'll understand once you read it). Her compassionate nature and youthful innocence is quite endearing. Giovanni's character is such a mystery which makes you want to know him and his family even more. The way he treats Nicoletta with such tenderness is such a contrast from how people perceived him to be.Christine Feehan has done well in describing the atmosphere within the palazzo including the design and architecture lending to the eeriness of the story there were some parts that dragged a bit but I guess she wanted the readers to have a good visual through out the read.

" Having read Feehan's 'Dark' series I have to say that I think this is her best book ever.

" I must confess that I was very leery to begin reading this book. My feelings have nothing to do with Ms. Feehan's writing style. I so love Christine's Dark series I feared that I would inevitably begin to make comparisons and would find this book a major disappointment. It wasn't.There is a terrible curse which plagues the Scarletti men. Every woman who enters the Palazzo as a bride winds up dead. What or . . . whom is causing these fatal accidents?Nicoletta is a healer who possesses 'special' gifts. Deep within her being she senses when someone needs her. She is drawn to the great Palazzo knowing that there is a young girl inside who is desperately ill. Once inside those forbidding walls she encounters Don Giovanni Scarletti known as Il Demonico (The demon).He is dark brooding and utterly dangerous. Nicoletta instinctively senses the potential threat he poses to her yet she is drawn to him as he is to her. Even the knowledge of his dark and deadly reputation cannot sever the attraction from growing.Don Scarletti also possesses his own 'gifts' and chooses her for a bride. What initially begins as a duty for Nicoletta turns into passion than into love. Will Nicoletta suffer the same fate as others have? Or will her unwavering love and ulfaltering courage finally bring an end to the family's deadly curse?You have to read the book in order to find out those answers and more. Enjoy! ",4.0

" I started this book with great expectations after reading all the dark series but found it not as compelling as them to start with. It took me a while to get into the book.

One is kept in suspense through out the whole story and then she just trows you who the killer is out of nowhere and in a rush. Her best work is the Dark series books. I cannot wait for DARK DESIRE.

" Though I still favor the carpathian series I really enjoyed this book. Christine Feehan still kept some of her supernatural writing which made this book stand out from others that write mystery romance.

" I'm not a rock snob; I just think Ann Wilson is sexy. I always liked this album; my favorite song is 'Nothin at All.' Until I got the CD I listened to the cassette edition. I was disappointed to hear that at least two of the tracks 'Never' and my favorite had been replaced with different takes. In the case of 'Never' I don't really care since the replacement sounds essentially the same as the original. But the original track for 'Nothin at All' is definitely preferable to its replacement.

" Well it may seem impossible but one could certainly argue the case with Heart's self-titled album. Released in the middle of a decade that made Heart's earlier material irrelevant to most mainstream audiences Heart found themselves back on the map in a huge way. Their debut 1976's Dreamboat Annie had established a band who could flaunt their ability to play hard rock and folk rock and mix things like moogs and flutes into their music. Basically everything that was wildly popular in the 70's. They also really helped show us how hard chicks could still rock.What Dreamboat Annie did for the 70's their self-titled album the 8th in their studio line did for the 80's. Teaming up with some professional songwriters and producer Ron Nevison (Europe Ozzy Osbourne KISS Survivor Jefferson Starship Chicago etc.) Ann and Nancy Wilson reinvented their look and sound for the decade and produced their best-selling album their first and only album to reach no. 1 and their first no. 1 single. The first four tracks (all of which were released as singles) give a good taste of what Heart would offer up on this album.You get your upbeat energetic chugga-chugga hard rock guitar riff in opener 'If Looks Could Kill.' Then 'What About Love' gives you a melancholy mid-tempo lyrically-heartfelt ballad but in spite of those characteristics it is filled with emotion that only Ann can deliver in song and music that helps her cause immensely. Next is 'Never' which is yet another ballad. This time however the sad sound is replaced with a more upbeat happy feel. Synths are very big in all these songs much like moogs and flutes in their early material. Arena Rock bands were big on hard rockers but at the same time always hit it real big on the charts with the ballads.The band's first no. 1 single came in the form of 'These Dreams' and given the time of this album's release it is not at all hard to see why. For one thing all the instrumental leads are synths. The drums are electric too and only the vocals and bass are not synthesized. This is perhaps the most mellow of all Heart's songs. For a long time I myself refused to even consider it a song of theirs but it became a convincing factor in my purchase of this album. This song truly shows what Nevison's synth-happy production can do for bands",4.0

The opening song 'If Looks Could Kill' is really rocking and after that there's many great songs and you could almost say that this is an ultimate fem-rock album...but then the ninth track 'What He Don't Know' proves to be so basic rock. The ballads 'These Dreams' and 'Nobody Home' are great ones as well as 'What About Love' 'The Wolf' 'Shell Shock' 'All Eyes' and 'Never' which are great classic rock songs. 'Nothin' at All' has great 'echo sounds' which were later copies by The Corrs. This is a great hard rock album although not so similar to 'Dreamboat Annie'.Stars",4.0
" At the time this was originally released I worked in a retail store in a department adjoining the music section. They used to play these tracks all the time. After a while I was kind of brainwashed. It got good to me so I bought the tape.The tape always annoyed me because it was so... linear. Couldn't skip the nasty tracks for the good ones easily. This CD release helps a lot with that. On the other hand I only just bought the CD and I stopped listening to the tape 10 years ago. It took me that long to remember to buy the CD version.My favorite tracks for 'These Dreams' 'What About Love' and 'Never'. This CD is about as pure 1980s rock as anything I can think of. Buy it if that's what you're looking for. ",4.0

" Some Heart fans like to pretend that 1985's self-titled Heart album never happened but the band's makeover as a keyboard-heavy AOR act gave their career a much needed shot in the arm as well as some much deserved attention. Between the hitmakers brought in to contribute on songwriting to the shiny 80's production job the band's self-titled album was as good an AOR album as you could hope for and featured some of the band's biggest hits.Sure the band 'sold out' and the material on Heart is much more radio friendly than their early material but we're not exactly talking Starship's 'We Built This City' here. The tracks on Heart are well-crafted pop songs that are written to take full advantage of the Wilson sisters' considerable talents. I was blown away by the glorious dramatic 'What About Love' and 'These Dreams' and the infectious 'Never' and 'Nothin' At All' two decades ago (God has it really been that long?) and am just as impressed today.I can see how old-school Heart fans could have a problem with this album but this is the Heart I grew up with so I'll always consider it a classic album.

" In 1985 the veteran 70's hard rock band Heart released their first album on Capital Records. Titled simply Heart the album represented a new direction for the band fronted by sisters Ann and Nancy Wilson. In the late 70's Heart had found a very successful commercial niche with their blend of Led Zepplin influenced hard rock combined with some folk influenced acoustic ballads. But the early 80's proved to be a rough time for the band as their style of music fell out of commercial favor and the group was rocked with line up changes that saw them first reduced from 6 members to 5 members with the departure of original lead guitarist Roger Fisher then the replacement of the bands rhythm section. By 1984 their previous label had released the band from its contract.Fortunately they were picked up by Capital. But the band its management and its label all knew that if they were to get back in the game they would have to make changes. Heart abandoned their Led Zep meets Joni Mitchell sound in which the Wilson sisters took charge of writing most of the material. Instead the band produced more radio friendly pop rock material with many of the songs written or co-written by professional songsmiths such as Billy Steinberg/Tom Kelly Bernie Taupin and Diane Warren. In addition to promote the new material the band glammed up their appearance for music videos and the directors made prominent use of the Wilson Sister's cleavage especially Nancy Wilson's as lead singer Ann battled with her weight during this era. These changes would prove controversial with many of the band's original fanbase and this created a split that exists to this day with some fans only preferring the 70's material while others like all their material. However the gambit worked and won the band a whole new generation of fans many of whom were not familiar with the band's previous musical incarnation and thus forming a third fanbase.Despite the change in direction certain elements remained the same",4.0

" While I do believe Heart's self-titled 9th album was a monumental success for the band I don't believe it should be considered the 'Comeback album'. The band had hit some hard times with it's two previous releases but those albums were so misunderstood by the public at their time of release. Both 'Private Audition' and 'Passionworks' now should and are revered by the die-hard fans like myself for their boldness and pardon the pun heart. Heart the album is very well produced and written my only problem with it is that most of the material was not written by the stellar writing team of Ann Wilson Nancy Wilson and Sue Ennis. This album although not a strong creative effort by Heart is still has an awesome sound and should be a staple in even the casual Heart fan's music library. So what are you waiting for BUY IT!!!

" I use these at church with my high school group. They are light and easy to carry. They seat 3 to a side.I have two common configurations I use. I put two of them together to make a 60'x60' square.

These seat seven to a side because you can use the ends between the two tables as a seat. For my uses this seats 14 also because I am up front speaking.I also do the janitorial work for my church and these are an easy clean. I've found that even pen isn't too hard to get off if you have the right tools. The hardest thing about cleaning these tables is that the name 'Lifetime' is recessed into each end of the table.

" It wasn't so long ago that I had the privilege of meeting Linnea in Peru. She was just coming back from a fundraising journey to the States where she received a prize of recognition for her selfless work in Amazonia. I was with a tour group that was to stay at several Amazonian jungle lodges. The Amazon was in it's annual flood stage and the only way any of us could get around was by small boat. La doctora Linnea had her own dugout which she paddled to and from the clinic the lodge and her patients all by herself in a dress. She wore skirts almost entirely because of the humidity and local custom. The only women who wear shorts or pants in Amazonia are tourists and scientists. Every evening Linnea would come to the lodge for a bit of relaxation and conversation with whomever was staying there but one couldn't help but notice how more comfortable she was in the company of the locals and guides. The Ribiernos [local river dwellers] didn't ask rude or probing questions. They were friendly without conpromising her privacy.This ingrained need to keep part of herself to herself comes through in the book she's written. She's happy to talk about her work and her love of the people but reveals little of her previous life. I recommend this book for the incredible story the sense of place to learn about people we would otherwise never know. She may not speak book-learned Spanish but communicates fluently with her friends and patients. As she writes she arrived in Peru speaking no Spanish. ",4.0

It's hard to know how these descriptions will play out in the mind's eye of other readers. The beginning of the book was particularly fascinating.Our face-to-face meeting left me with the impression that she is not trying to run away from society not trying to crusade for the underprivileged not trying to be 'holier than thou'. She really likes what she is doing. The book confirms this.When you read this book you are looking inside La Doctora. Nothing is hidden. There are no pretenses. She is simply good people.Incidently she wanted the book named 'At the River's Edge' and the publishers wanted 'La Doctora'. The publishers won. ",4.0

The store owner agreed and took it out of his CD player and gave it to her half price since it was used.

I realized that i really loved these songs i don't know what the lyrics are about it just sounds that there is some pain and love in these songs.. In the 5th song 'El Payande' it sounds like she is defying somebody/something and then gives in. And then the next song starts playing it made me recall a summer in Barcelona..

" Welcome to the Splatterparty! This is one nasty little bloodbath showered down upon us with sick and grueling depravity that only underground horror can provide. Gorelovers grab a fork! Writer/director Leif Jonker and his friends actually financed much of this cult gem with their own blood using the money they earned from their donations at the nearby plasma bank.$5000 budget? Are you kidding me? I heard Rob Zombie's Halloween remake had a budget of around 15 million.Now it does have the expected problems that come with a super-low budget horror flick. Horrendous acting amateurish directing bad transfer. But really I think this adds to the charm. The narrative jumps around alot which didn't seem to serve much of a purpose. We're often given indications--23 minutes to daylight or 9 minutes to night. But it would still look like broad daylight. Kinda silly but all is forgiven. And when some people have a delayed reaction to the heinous onslaught occurring just in front of them you can't help but yell 'Run dummy!'. Oh well...Luckily there is enough awesome to make you forget about the ridiculous. Darkness is a pretty straight forward vampire story stuck back in the 80's. We've got mullets Hard Rock Cafe T-Shirts & some cheesy metal. The violence jumps right in and never stops. I'm talking about blood blood blood. And more blood. It sometimes feels more like a apocalyptic zombie tale. Other times maybe a gory cannibal flick. Trust me there will be lots of flesh rippage and gooey carnage.This has an incredibly vicious ending. Badass stuff! It kinda reminded me of the flesh melting scene at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark. But better!

If you have a soft spot for low-budget splatter and are very forgiving you'll probably like this. It's kind of like a modern version of a Fred Olen Ray flick but with no boobs. The gore and action are spread liberally throughout so it never gets boring. There are a few(okay many) glaring examples of poor or lazy scripting(like the dumb broad who watches in horror as her boyfriend is torn apart for like 4 minutes instead of running yeah right) but nothing out of the ordinary for this type of movie. As a child of the 80's the cheesy thrash metal longhairs and mullet models that made up the cast(and probably the crew) really took me back and made me feel nostalgic.

" 'At War With The Army' Dean Martin & Jerry Lewis' first starring feature (after 2 plum supporting roles in 'My Friend Irma' and the sequel 'My Friend Irma Goes West') is clearly an excuse to see if this new comedy duo can carry a picture. And why not start them off in a service comedy? Look what 'Buck Privates' did for Abbott & Costello!AWWTA is based on a stage play and really looks it. With the exception of a few outdoor scenes most of the film is very 'stagebound' as the characters occupy a handful of set pieces and Martin & Lewis are obliged to share their screen time with a wide assortment of characters. Strangely enough Martin & Lewis do not seem to be intentionally paired as a team here since their characters only cavort in a few scenes together. One of the 'convincers' that they are a team is the 'Service Show' scene obviously a holdover from their nightclub act. The problem is that their 2 characters are mostly at odds with each other since one is Sargeant (Martin) while the other is a lowly Private (Lewis). Dean sings his songs as smoothly as he does in future movies while Jerry sings a cute funny novelty number that 'The Navy Gets the Gravy While the Army Gets the Beans' and does a curious turn in drag singing a French accent and mugging it up.The film has a sort of 'B-movie' feel to it mostly because it was produced by someone else and not Hal Wallis who would give such polish & style to their following films. The DVD interpretation here is scratchy dark & blurred in spots but still viewable.Although not their best by any means AWWTA was a big hit when it first debuted and was an indication that the best from Martin & Lewis was still to come.

" Hollywood Classics Collection DVD1950 Black & White with a running time of 92 min.Directed by Hal WalkerStarring Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin and introducing Polly BergenThe transfer from VHS to DVD was done well. The picture quality and sound are very good.In this film Martin and Lewis are starting out their career together. Martin plays a Sergeant that has girl troubles and Lewis plays a bumbling Private First Class. They find out that the Army isn't so accommondating to their wants or desires. Martin's singing in this film reminds us of how remarkable and charming he was. The antics Lewis performs shows us his talent of mockery and silliness. The best scenes of this film are when Lewis is dressed as a woman singing a love song to a drunk soldier and Lewis' battle with the soda machine. This film is a good family film but probably wouldn't keep the attention of the younger generations. However for our generation it is a nice look back at the beginning career of Martin and Lewis.

" At War With the Army was the first starring role for the team of Martin and Lewis. They had yet to build that perfect chemistry together and most of their best scenes in the film are separate from each other. But still you could see where the duo would eventually go on to huge things in many future films.Martin plays bully Sgt. Puccinelli who is always picking (often nastily) on poor private Alvin Korwen (Lewis). They were buddies from back home but now Puccinelli just bosses Alvin around. There's not much plot to speak of. The action mainly takes base at an Army training base and more specifically in the orderly room. It's mostly an excuse for Jerry to do some of his trademark slapstick and for Dean to sing which is all ridiculously out of place but still fun to watch. Polly Bergen is along in her first role as Martin's girlfriend Helen.The Film was directed by Hal Walker who had worked on severl of the Hope & Crosby road pictures so he had some experience in dealing with a similiar comedy team although certainly one that was much more polished than Martin and Lewis were in 1950. Overall it was a light but entertaining comedy. Much like seeing the pair do their nightclub routine but framed by this army setting. ",4.0

Yes it's more of a booklet than a textbook but it takes time to work through it....as a side resource it usually takes me a school year to get through it with my students. I also have given this book as a gift to older people who have wanted to learn to draw but have never had lessons etc. and it benefits them immensely. It also has benefited even advanced students....

" I took a class from Bruce McIntyre in 1968 or maybe 1969. I enjoyed it so much and buying this drawing book brought back memories of what I had learned then. He makes drawing much easier than I thought it was but showing easy things to use to make the picture come to life. A friend borrowed my books from the class and I never got them back when I moved so I was elated to get the Drawing Textbook from Amazon. YEA!!! ",4.0

" This book is one of those books that captured your attention from the beginning to the end. What differentiates this book from other books about Russia is the author's ability to convey to us the mood the essence of a country that was in the brink of collapse & to be revived as a brand new country. It is also one of those books that is difficult to be summarised in a few words but rather it has to be read to be appreciated. This work depicts Russia as a country with turbulent & troubled histories occupied by citizens some who were proud of its past glories (particularly its victory over the Facism in the war with Germany during World War 2 its Great Empire's status and a superforce to be reckoned with in the past) & would shed their bloods for the glory of their nation some who opted for the stability of the past when Communism seemed to promise that everybody is going to be looked after some who are anxious to be caught on with the rest of the world. For an ex-Communist country that tried to catch up with the West shamelessly influenced by capitalism for as long as we can remember it has to overcome its steep learning curve. Growing pains such as emergence of mafias instead of enterpreneurs surfaced corruptions civil wars & so forth. A few chapters in the book are highly interesting such as the rise & fall of Gorbachev (clearing the myths about him & conveying him as what a politician should be) the emergence of Yeltsin & despite their differences both of them deservedly win their places in history. Moreover there are also chapters about common people who are living in God forsaken places with no basic necessities such as clean air indoor plumbing heating system that actually works intellectuals who wanted to bring out the correct version of Russia's history so that they could learn from the past & evolve from there to better beings but alas it wasn't meant to be writers like Sakharov Solzhenitsyn who dared to write of the truths for the love of their nation with total disregard of their own safety people who were killed in the millions during Stalin's reign & Stalin as a person Khruschev Brezhnev coup-de-etat that was supposed to clean up the mess that Gorbachev had created but subsequently it was deemed as a farce in its own right & so forth. A substantial book that enlightens me about the plight of Russia & a book that is definitely worth reading in this lifetime. Highly recommended. ",4.0

" Having read this title while vacationing in Jamaica (even though placed in Dominica and the author grew up in Atigua)I was entirely able to understand Xuela. Many children are born out of wedlock though the fathers still are involved with their children. Xuela is an extreme but not implausible case of emotional detachment. Everything in the book from her father's corruption to encountering the stevedore during a downpour came to life in my reading experience. Be forewarned Xuela is not a likeable character and her physical self-love may be offensive to some readers. But Jamaica Kincaid's blunt and honest portrayal of a hardened woman is undeniably hard to forget. ",4.0
" Jamaica Kincaid's work always provokes sentiment for me. As a fellow Caribbean native she describes some deep darks truths about people. . .truths that are consistent only among Caribs as they are influenced by thier social and cultural norms.In this novel the mother's character at parts seemed much like my own mother",4.0
" The Autobiography of My Mother is not an autobiography at all and it is not even solely about a mother. It is actually a novel about a woman whose mother died when she was being born. This first life event which is also the first event the narrator tells the reader about in the story is a powerful force that shapes the narrator's life.Not only does narrator (Xuela) not have a mother but she feels that she does not actually have a country a homeland. She lives on the island of Antigua which is only twelve miles long and nine miles long. The culture of her people was stolen by their English colonizers and the only culture they now know is that of England.In my opinion there are times in the book when the narrator is self-pitying and repetitive. I do think however that this is in keeping with her character. The book is written as if Xuela is sitting down with the reader and telling him or her her life story and Xuela would definitely be a character who would repeat and overemphasize the bad parts just so the person listening would get the point.I also found fault with the narrator because she was very hyprocritical. She critized her father's actions and attitude about life but then she acted in simliar ways and had a simliar attitude. The one positive aspect about the main character is that she is a very strong woman who is not afraid to deviate from her society's acceptable ways of behaving.I was surprised that I liked this book so much when I did not like the narrator. I think it is because Kincaid had such an integrity when it came to writing about the main character. She presented all aspects positive and negative and didn't only show her in a good light. All aspiring authors can learn a lesson in characterization from reading this book.Kincaid's writing style is very seductive. It pulls you in and makes you not want to get away. I read this book in two long settings because I didn't want to put it down. She has a powerful way of describing people places and situations. Her prose is lyrical and truthful - after reading a passage I wanted to sit back and think about it for awhile because there was so much truth and beauty to be found in it.This is the first book I have read by Jamaica Kincaid. I am presently reading 'A Small Place' and hope to read the rest of her books in the future. I would recommend this book to anyone but especially to writers who are interested in reading very high quality writing with strong charactarization and powerful description. ",4.0
" It is difficult to rate Autobiography of My Mother fairly; Jamaica Kincaid has written excellent books - At the Bottom of the River Lucy . . . - and this book is only well above average. Were my expectations not so high the things that are right about the book would stand out more against the portions that don't work. She is at her best when portraying the inability to love and the bitterness at the colonialist religion. However there are points in the story where the political portrayal of victor vs. vanquished becomes a polemic out of character of the protagonist. A good book that is well worth reading - but is probably more enjoyable if you have read Annie John Lucy or One Small Place so that the political polemic fits the reader's growing knowledge of the author rather than simply being an element less adroitly handled in this particular book.

" As a child did you ever hear your mother call 'Time to come inside and practice?' You were having a great time playing outdoors doing really fun things with your friends and now you have sit inside on a piano bench and play those durn scales.Or as a parent have you been frustrated because your offspring won't take time to practice when you're paying good money for flute violin or tuba lessons?Most of us have been in one of those situations or both. Now Amy Nathan author of 'The Young Musician's survival Guide' gives us her latest book which proves we're not alone. 'Meet the Musicians' is an upbeat informative up-close-and-personal look at 15 professional musicians all members of the New York Philharmonic. Many of them didn't like to practice when they were kids any more than we did. As adults and accomplished disciplined musicians they offer excellent practice tips for both parents and children as well as sharing the paths they took to being part of a world class symphony orchestra.Beginning with Carter Brey Cello and concluding with John Deak Bass we find photos of these musicians as children their favorite childhood activities their educational backgrounds the inside scoop on particular instruments how they came to be members of the New York Philharmonic and brief biographical sketches.Young readers will easily relate to these musicians on many different levels.Violist Cynthia Phelps said 'When I'm on stage I think I'm the luckiest person in the world having such a good time doing what I love to do.' She speaks for the musicians represented here and perhaps for the musicians of tomorrow.Also included in 'Meet the Musicians' is a helpful glossary and list of resources for those who wish to further pursue an interest in music.- Gail Cooke ",4.0

" My cd arrived securely packaged in a corrugated cardboard envelope. The cd itself was in a plain paper sleeve not the nice cover shown in the picture. However I have seen karaoke cds from this particular company before in karaoke supply stores and all Superstar Karaoke cds came in plain paper sleeves--no cover no plastic box no lyric booklet pretty basic as karaoke cds go. However the quality of sound and selection of songs is really good considering how inexpensive and no-frills this company is. There are no vocal demonstrations on this cd but the instrumental tracks contain the appropriate background vocals. Of course when played on home or professional karaoke systems you will have the standard graphics with the color changing lyrics. For those who would like vocal demos or a printed lyric booklet you might try a different company.I am actually very pleased with this product since I knew pretty much what I would be getting and I loved the songs.Also a couple of notes for those completely new to karaoke cds--these recordings DO NOT contain the actual original artists but the original keys and arrangements are the same in the recreations.

" I first started taking this because I saw it on Dr. OZ as a remedy for menstrual cramps well what I saw on Dr. OZ was actually 'Chaste Tree Extract' but I have not been able to find that. This is probably the same thing because it works. I started taking it a few days before I expected my period and continued until my period was over and my cramps were not as agonizing as they usually are. I soon started to notice that my hormonal acne (Nodulocystic acne on my chin) was not as bad when taking these supplements so I started taking it every day. That led to the unexpected 'problem' of me not getting my period for several months. I got a little scared and went to the doctor about it. She told me to stop taking it and sure enough I got my period a few months later. I didn't take this stuff for a while because of the whole messing with my cycle thing I figured it would be best not to do that but recently my hormonal acne has been raging again no amount of acne cream was making it go away so I started taking this again and it went away within a few days. I figure maybe I can treat this stuff like the birth control pill (not for birth control obviously) but to even out my hormones and I can stop taking it for a week or so to make sure I don't go months without a period. At the time I was also taking St. Johns Wart which I am no longer taking so that could have been the cause of my missed periods since it seems that everyone else reports more regular periods on this herb.

" I read the book in it's entirety the day I received it. At $24 I thought I'd be getting a comprehensive & possible critical review of each short story or novel RAH ever wrote. Don't get me wrong I really enjoyed the book. It's a fun read and there is a lot of information there. Just no critical review or analysis of the stories. I started reading RAH back around 1960 (early teen years) and immediately fell in love with them. He introduced me to Science Fiction and I went on to read and enjoy many other great writers. I've lost count as to how many times I have read each of his works. There is no question that RAH is the Bard of the genre. I had hoped that in this book there would have been information and a point of view that I hadn't already read or known about for all these years.However if you are a new reader or just have read a few of his works this book can help you find some of his 'stronger' works to read. But I strongly recommend that you find (it's out of print and somewhat difficult to find) an early work entitled 'The Past Through Tomorrow' which contains most of his 'Future History' stories. This one I've read many times and never get tired of reading it. From very short to novel length each story is a gem. They remind me of a Beatle album in that every track is a 5 star gem. Have fun.

" This album isn't for everyone but it's still a great album.If you're a fan of dirty punk music e.g. the Dead Boys Fear the Ramones the Dead Kennedys or the Sex Pistols you're probably a good candidate for appreciating this album. The vocals are unorthodox to say the least. Most of the lyrics are in Japanese or English and all of them are either spit or screamed.Every chord piano gliss drum beat and jubilant yell is absolutely bursting with lightning-energy. The 5 6 7 8s remind me of a female Japanese version of the Kingsmen (Louie Louie). They play dirty loud fun garage rock with the occassional rip roaring surf tune.If you have ecletic tastes this is a good band to pick up. If you like sugary pop or strictly mainstream music then you'll probably think this band is full of no-talent hacks. You'd be wrong of course but you'd still have felt like you wasted money.If you're crazy enough to embrace this kind of music but don't think it goes quite far enough give Guitar Wolf a try. They hold the record for the loudest band in the world and they're a crazy Japanese punk band. ",4.0
" Do the Mojo! Meaning buy this 5678's CD and rock out to it. 'Teenage Mojo Workout' is divided almost equally between cover songs and originals. It's nostalgic enough for many a retro rock fiend yet cool enough for the youthly crowd.Musicians just don't tell us to 'do the go-go' or sing songs titled 'Hanky Panky' any more and that's where this hard-rockin' girl-trio from Japan comes in. Word has it that the band's name originates from the notion that the fifties was Elvis the sixties was surf the seventies was punk and the eighties was the 5678's. 'Mojo' has the potential to soothe the savage rockabilly junkie and even the odd honky-tonk fan with it's wailing pop of yore guitar licks groovy hip-shaking basslines and jump-uppity drumming.Cover tracks on the CD include 'I'm Blue' originally by Ike and Tina Turner's The Ikettes and 'Harlem Shuffle' by Bob and Earl (also covered by the Rolling Stones).The vocals are largely in Engrish so listeners lacking patience and a sense of humor may feel flummoxed and frustrated with much of the singing. For example the 'Harlem Shuffle' lyric 'you slide into the limbo/Yeah how low can you go' sounds more like 'soar into the rainbow/Woo harm an eagle'.Only Japanese speakers will have the slightest clue what vocalist/guitarist Ronnie Yoshiko Fujiyama is singing about on 'New Orleans Rock' but the jazzy piano can be a welcome addition to the album's line-up especially as part of the final track. No foreign language or Engrish-comprehension skills are required to understand the the instrumentals 'Road Runner' 'Typhoon Girl' and 'Green Onions'. Knock yourself out.If the album is a 'Workout' then 'In the Subway' is the cooldown. The title track features a wild tambourine while 'In the Subway' has soft-rippling timpanies. Ronnie's voice sounds sultry and soothing on 'Subway' whereas she usually sings with a scratchy shout.The liner notes are mostly in Japanese but the b&w; studio photo of Ronnie on the back cover defies language.This CD is not recommended for everyone but if you came to look for it here then you probably want it and you should probably get it.

" John Cena plays John Triton a Marine who was discharged after disobeying a direct order in order to save his fellow soldiers in war. He returns home to his wife Kate (Kelly Carlson) and after not being able to adjust to his homelife so easliy they take a vacation. Unfortunally John ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time as he crosses paths with a group of jewel thieves at a gas station led by a killer named Rome (Robert Patrick) and after things don't go as planned they go on the run & kidnap Kate as a hostage. From there John goes after the thieves to save his wife but encounter many obsticals along with the way while the theives have problems of their own such as not being to trust each other & Kate being tougher than she looks.This is one of those generic action movies where the plot itself was very simple & something the average person can understand. The acting isn't much as Cena had no previous acting experience before this role so his dialog is very limited but did do well & was believeable in his role. They have good action scenes from a car chase to fist fights to tons of explosions. The most annoying thing here though was that they tried to add comedy to this movie which didn't work at all. For example when the bad guys are in the jungle running from the police...that's not the time to start making jokes about 'rock candy' & getting calls about their cable TV package eventhough I did get a chuckle as the priceless look Patrick gave after the 'he's like the Terminator' line.While the DVD included both the unrated & theatrical versions of the movie the DVD extras include all the WWE promotional features footage of the World Premiere various features on John Cena and a 'Making Of' featurette. Bottom line is that this movie is good for those who just like a good old action flick that you used to see back in the 80's full of explosions & fist fight scenes. ",4.0
" It's back to the good old days.The action packed Schwarzennegger films where the kill-shot reigns with side-splitting dialogue.Problem is! Robert Patrick is the star. John Cena makes a credible Arnold but Mr. Patrick does a wonderful villain. He's got the lines and he's nailed the perfect bad guy with a flair that would make Hannibal Lecter cringe. A great job by the former star of The X-Files who made John Doggett a memorable experience.Action and blowup sequences are A-1 all the way.The perfect film for escapist violence. ",4.0

This is his first leading role.Robert Patrick does a great job as Rome.Mixing humor and sarcasm.He is not your typical coldblooded killer like you have seen in other movies. ",4.0
" OK. First off I don't see this movie winning any prizes for story script plot or anything like that.That being said I think it was a good action flick. It was well-casted the fight scenes were well-choreographed and the explosions were lots of fun. Also I think it was a good start for Cena. Get the man some acting lessons and let him try something that doesn't involve as much running around and beating the heck out of people. ",4.0
" You pays your money and you takes your choice. When you go to see a movie like this you should know what you're in for. There's going to be a lot of bad guys and they're going to be really bad. There's going to be a damsel in distress. There's going to be a surprise bad guy. And last but not least there's going to be a good guy who is good and tough beyond belief.John Triton (John Cena) is an heroic ex-marine whose wife Kate (Kelly Carlson) is kidnapped by a brutal gang of jewel thieves led by Rome (Robert Patrick) who kills with glee and without remorse which doesn't set him apart from his psychopathic gang members. John takes out after them. You get the feeling that John can take on anything up to the size of a platoon without much of a problem. While credibility might suffer during his chase it's still fun. You will rarely see a human being with arms the size of Cena's.Written (Michelle Gallagher and Alan McElroy) and directed (John Bonito) with humor and pace what surprised me about it was that the acting is uniformly good including Cena. This is a tongue-in-cheek chase film with some absurdly unbelievable stunts and special effects but it's all done on a level that nobody takes very seriously.Although there is a lot of violence it's not graphic in the sense that we see people's heads being blown off. I was tired and sleepy when I attended the film but never even felt a twinge of nodding off.Perfect for a saturday night with friends after a long week of work. ",4.0
" I am surprised by how much I enjoyed this. Surprised and a little disappointed in my own taste but anyway...You know exactly what to expect from this movie. Explosions Fighting...and that's it. Luckily it delivers both of those in spades especially the 'splosions. I have never seen so many things blow up. Every fifteen minutes John Cena barely escapes some building blowing up. And in slow motion of course. The story is Kelly Carlson is kidnapped by Robert Patrick and John Cena must rescue her.Robert Patrick is plain fantastic in this flick. The filmmaker is smart as he gave the lion's share of the line to Mr. Patrick. He plays a great sarcastic bad guy plain and simple. John Cena can act in the sense that Arnold Schwarzenegger can act. Mr. Cena lets his actions do the speaking thankfully. Plus he's a hottie so...Overall just an easy cheesy blow-em-up action B-movie. The extras are pretty lame though. ",4.0
" I thought that the movie was really good. I didnt like the fact every time John left a building it blew up but I was surprized to see how well John Cena could act. I really enjoyed it and it kept us entertained. ",4.0
" I will not go into the breakdown of the movie - that is already done in other reviews. Yes the action scenes can be a bit unbeliveable - but what action movie made today is done realistically? That is part of the fun of action movies. John Cena is best known for being the WWE Monday Night RAW champ - and this is his 1st acting movie. I personally think he was great in this movie - he looked hunky and shows he can act as well as kick butt. I hope that he will do more movies in the future - and also look forward to seeing him on Monday night RAW - the champ is in the house and if you are not down with that I have 2 words for ya . ..

" I rented 'The Marine' with no expectations except for good action and 'eye candy' (Mr. Cena is a beautiful man). I always enjoy the classic good vs. evil story and seeing the bad guy get it. Think of the 80's action movies and that is what 'The Marine' is like. I enjoyed the movie and while I am not a wrestling fan I do support the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) because they support our troops all over the world. They make trips to bases every year and risk their safety to entertain the wonderful men and women of our Armed Forces! John Cena has a very likable quality and because of his love and appreciation for our troops and their families he can rest assured that I will gladly give my dollars and support to him in whatever he undertakes. God Bless you John and the WWE!!! ",4.0

" I thought this movie was pretty cool for the most part. Robert Patrick's role also added to it's success and suspense. Lots of action and the storyline was well written. Maybe John Cena is the next big action star to Hollywood and to action movies in general. I think if he continues to make them like this he will be. Thought it was better than 12 rounds as well.Peter J. Miller ",4.0

" Being a John Cena fan you can never be sure that the charisma that he shows on the small screen will translate to the big screen but after watching The Marine he does not have to worry about that. All the action in the movie keeps fans glued to the screens and wondering what could possibly happen next. Not a dull moment in the movie. Can't wait for it to come to the movies cinemas here in Australia in June 07 so we can watch him larger than life and in surround sound will make a great movies even better. ",4.0

" The first 15 minutes of this brilliant film are probably the best 15 minutes ever captured. The rest of the movie is dull and a bit annoying in an awesome action that doesn't make any sense with terrible acting sort of way. But those first 15 minutes I seriously watched twice because I was laughing so hard I cried the first time through. Watch this movie because it has by far and away the best opening scene any film could aspire to achieve. ",4.0
" THE MARINEI have to admit that I have enjoyed all of the 7 or 8 or something like that WWE produced films this one in particular. Sure some have been better then others but all have at least been entertaining this one here would be in that category. I always liked John Cena especially when he was a heel he has always been entertaining. So once WWE really wanted to get going with the movies I knew Cena would be starring in one. I am glad that the film did well enough at the box office for them to let him do another. I found this movie to be very enjoyable even though it is flawed.The movie is about John Triton an ex marine who is having a hard time adjusting to his new life as a civilian. After a mishap at a security guard job he took he and his wife decided to go on a trip to any were just to get away on vacation. It is on this trip that they run into some trouble at a gas station it turns out that some people who are also there just robbed a diamond place and is on the run. When things go wrong Triton's wife is kidnapped by these guys and the chase is on. So the rest of the movie we are treated to an action filled adventure that pits one man's love for his wife against those who have a lust for money and power.The strong point of this film is obviously the ridiculous unbelievable action sequences and I do mean unbelievable. Michell Gallagher and Alan McElroy did a decent job with the script basically just adding a few words to pages full of explosions and fist fights. For this a WWE film that is just fine and I did not expect any thing else so it makes perfect sense. Director John Bonito shows that he has a talent for making a fun yet over the top action flick and he even makes Cena look good in his first acting gig so credit to you sir. Director of photography David Eggby did a great job shooting this movie as the camera work is great Executive producer Vince McMahon knows how to hire the right people. Every one behind the scenes did what a consider a good job given that this was supposed to be a WWE action movie job well done.As far as the acting I think that while Cena has a way to go before he wins any Oscars he actually does a good job with this film he has a natural charisma that carries over onto the screen. At times it looks like the performance is forced but over all he does a pretty good job in my opinion I don't know why but I think he would be perfect in a comedy or a family comedy. Kelly Carlson is good as Cena's wife and brings a nice little charm to the film even though at times she gets rough with the other characters. Robert Patrick is great in the lead villain role with a sly humor to him and his partner Abigail Bianca is just as good. In fact to be honest no one does a bad job in this film and in fact all of them do very well for this type of film.I liked this movie I thought it was a fun over the top action flick in the vain of 80's movies [like other reviews have said]; it is a good weekend/afternoon movie. A lot of people talk bad about this movie and John Cena in particular but I liked it and Cena. I think if Cena is given time to develop as an actor I think he could actually be good. Hopefully he has developed more for the upcoming '12 Rounds'; I will go see it keep up the WWE streak. Hope to see ya there. ",4.0
" This movie has a lot of action and my husband loved it. I do however warn you about the language. I wouldn't have any underage viewers present if you watch and the language even made me want to leave the room but if your okay with that the movie is very action-packed. ",4.0
" This is one for the hard core action fans. There's very little 'down time' to run for popcorn. If someone isn't getting shot punched etc. things are getting blown up or sunk in water.

" I never expected to be so thrilled and entertained by this almost tongue-in-cheek non-stop action thriller.Robert Patrick (The BAD Terminator in Terminator 2) is perfect as a vicious killer but still pokes fun at his own movie when one of his killer friends who is failing at getting 'The Marine' off their back comments",4.0
" To be honest  I gave it 4 stars but it's more like a 3 1/2 simply because it does have it's good points to it .This film take's us back to the 'later 80's action film ara' and can be compared to some of Steven Sagals films  or even Dulf Lungren.I just can't get over the fact that it's John Cena in this film (and that's not really a good thing) His acting was OK and the action was good  but it's no 'Condemed' with Stone Cold !In short  it's OK and that's about it . It will entertain and it isn't a waste of money or time .3 1/2 Stars ",4.0
" The Marine is a no holds barred action vehicle filled with cardboard characters and a plot straight out of an episode of the 1980's G.I. Joe cartoon. Yeah there are plot holes logic bombs and more cheesy dialogue than Kraft could put in a dozen commercials but this doesn't stop the movie from being a lot of fun to watch.WWE wrestling superstar John Cena plays John Triton a U.S. Marine who has been scapegoated and dishonorably discharged for disobeying an order from commanding officers and is making an adjustment to civilian life with his hot wife. He gets a job at a security firm where...he gets fired for disobeying an order. After this mishap he and his wife decide to go away where at a gas station they run afoul of some diamond smugglers who kill a cop and kidnap take his wife for a hostage so they can make their getaway. In the quest to get her back Triton goes through car chases explosions and death defying scenarios. It's best not to take these too seriously; this is the kind of action movie where you turn your brain off and enjoy the show.Despite the logic holes The Marine reminds me of the kind of old-fashioned action movie I used to watch back in the late 1980's-1990's like American Ninja or Ninja III",4.0
" Yes the plot is paper-thin and fairly ridiculous but for a fun mindless action romp this film delivers. John Cena is quite good and natural as an actor and Robert Patrick is always great. There was some very funny dialogue as the film did seem to be spoofing the entire genre. And it is always funny to watch the hero emerge from non-stop brutal fights and blazing infernos with scarcely a hair out of place. ",4.0

" This is one of Asimov's early masterpieces. However I would not recomend it to those who like action books. This has only a little bit of action in it. The main attraction to it is the intellectual stimulation. The Galactic Empire is falling after 12000 years. Hari Seldon realizes it and using the science of psychohistory the prediction of the future in broad statistical terms establishes two Foundations 'at opposite ends of the Galaxy' to cushion the Fall. This the first of the classic Foundation series to be written (though only 3rd in chronological order) traces the early development of the First Foundation as it struggles first simply to survive in the prescence of powerful hostile Kingdoms (which had formerly been parts of the Galactic Empire) and then to gradual growth and domination of its area of the Galaxy and the promise of eventually establishing a Second Galactic Empire. Not a traditional novel but perfect if you like history as it traces the 'historical' development of a nation. This is the epitome of the future history genre ",4.0
" Foundation consists of five stories separated by several decades each. The Trantorian Empire has lost its hold on the outer perimeter of the galaxy. Hari Seldon founder of the predictive science of psychohistory knows that the Empire is doomed to collapse and that thirty millennia of barbarism and anarchy will ensue before a second empire will rise. But Seldon claims to know a way to shorten the dark ages from 30000 years to a single millennium.The stories in Foundation chronicle the infancy and development of Seldon's Foundation society initially established on the remote planet Terminus. Seldon's psychohistory predicts several crises that the Foundation must survive in order to bring about the desired drastic shortening of the dark ages. Four of the five stories each describe a crisis that confronts the Foundation.So far I've read the Robot series the Empire series and the first three books in the Foundation series (Prelude to Foundation Forward the Foundation Foundation). I find the epic story so far to be extremely engaging and imaginative. The stories in Foundation are a bit disconnected and not fleshed out enough but nevertheless do a more than adequate job of describing the fall of the Galactic Empire. ",4.0
" I decided to reread the Asimov series in order. Asimov's 'Foundation series' novels are classics of the science fiction genre. Some of the foundation novels drag on a bit but 'Foundation and Empire' moves along well. The Asimov style emphasizes interpersonal relationships as opposed to showcasing gee-whiz science fiction apparatus. If you like science fiction you should read the foundation series novels as they are the basis of a lot of subsequent science fiction novels. Indeed Star Wars may have been based on the Foundation novels or at least influenced their development. ",4.0
" You will like this one. A little easier to get into than Foundation since you understand where he is going with the series now. ",4.0
" Like 1st Foundations I had not read this one in years. It did not seam as rich as I thought I remembered it. Was glad to see a Kindle Edition so it was easy to revisit this classic. ",4.0
" Clear intelligent prose marks this as well as Asimov's other books. The fact that there is hardly any action in this trilogy and yet it is still fun to read shows you how good Asimov is at writing just 'intellectual' fiction.But the truth be told Foundation is not 'the greatest sci-fi series of all time.' Sure it won the Hugo that said just that. But that was only about fifteen years after the trilogy was published and remember only fifteen years after the Hugo Award was instituted. Fifteen years isn't long enough to be making grandiose all-time statements like that.After Foundation Asimov was to grow as a writer. He said so himself. He admits its faults",4.0
" There are a lot of people reviewing this book on this website who give it low reviews because it's dated. Yeah sure it's dated...it was written in the forties it's going to be dated but that doesn't lower the quality of the story.Now that that's out of the way",4.0
" Ive been a long time sci-fi/fantasy fan. However it has taken me many years to finally pick up a book Ive heard so much about. Through the first half of the book it felt like the average sci-fi novel. However as I neared the end I found myself enjoying it. Asimov included some witty political resolutions to the puzzles and 'Seldon crisis' throughout the book. I kept wanting more of these carefully crafted shorts and was very entertained towards the end.Asimov could have executed the story a little better so that the timeline didn't skip fifty years after every short. The lasting effect of this piece is somewhat diminished by this fact. Also the repetition of plot will keep me from reading any more of the series. I think it is the tragic flaw in Asimov too much of a good thing. He has books published about everything it seems. Search for 'Asimov' and you will see what I mean.Overall it was a good book and I highly recommend it. It was an enjoyment to pass the time with. ",4.0
" I am not a science fiction fan without being a fan of the big idea but in the Foundation Asimov introduced galaxy-wide empires and a plausible new science. There's no new compelling themes in this book. Without that quality you are left to Asimov's weaknesses",4.0
" In this sequel to 'Foundation' Asimov continues to channel Edward Gibbon charting the rise and fall of the Galactic Empire and the subsequent rebirth like a phoenix from the ashes of a new and improved federation.On its own 'Foundation and Empire' suffers from an acute case of Middle Chapter Syndrome--and this is somewhat surprising since Asimov originally published his trilogy as a series of nine novellas. The reader who isn't familiar with the first 'Foundation' with its extended prologue and four installments will be at a loss. In the previous book each chapter details a different interplanetary chess match between (on the one hand) the long-dead 'psychohistorian' Hari Seldon who had predicted the empire's demise and who initiated events that will accelerate the rise of a second empire and (on the other) various individuals who struggle in vain to change the course of that inexorable future.'The General' and 'The Mule' the two episodes in this volume will surprise the reader by departing from the pattern in the previous book. The first and shorter story is the lesser of the two; all the 'action' occurs offstage and the protagonists wait in suspense for a catastrophe that never really materializes. It's a bit of a letdown but Asimov presents this incident to make a point",4.0
" Great classic Sci Fi. Loved it. It was fun to notice some of the technology that is already outdated like microfiche and televisions how nuclear power was so important but this didn't affect my interest or enjoyment in the novel. ",4.0
" Foundation is a reread for me (I read it way back when I was in high school) and to be honest I can't decide if I liked it more then or if I liked it more now. Which probably means that I felt the same way about it both times.Which is that it is a well-written intriguing work of thoughtful science fiction.When it comes down to it Foundation is the type of science fiction that I SHOULD love. It takes place in a believable scary future Earth isn't remembered or maybe doesn't even exist the entire galaxy is populated and there are lots of cool future gadgets. More than that it is filled with intelligent people who have to think in interesting convoluted ways to make the things that happen happen. It even starts off with a mathematician - brilliance!And that is why I DID love this book - I loved trying to figure out how the people were going to think or how they were thinking and what conclusions this would lead them to. It was like a mystery but one in which you just have to unravel intelligence. The narrative flows beautifully and the plot is just complex enough to keep you exited and thinking without feeling like Asimov was trying too hard.When it comes down to it Foundation really is the perfect science fiction novel and it's no wonder that it won the Hugo and was named 'Best Science Fiction Series of All Time.'But (you knew there was a but coming) I'm not the hugest fan of short stories and Foundation is essentially a series of short stories. Granted the short stories are so well-linked that you sometimes forget but when it comes down to it each chapter is a new story. In each chapter at least 50 years have passed since the last one entirely new characters are introduced and the old ones for the most part are rarely mentioned again. The thing linking them is Harri Seldon and the Foundation that he created. It is because of this that even though I loved it I can't say that I LOVED it.Still Foundation is one tight piece of work and I would recommend it to any and all lovers of science fiction. I mean when it comes to science fiction this is it! And I know I'll be rereading the others in the series as well! ",4.0
" I've come to start with four stars as I note that no book is perfect; considering this is just a story it can't be perfect. My giving a book much less this one four stars is no knock on it.Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clark are considered the beginning of 'hard' sci-fi. It's not strictly true as there were guys like H.G. Wells Jules Verne and might I add Johannas Kepler? There's also the Frankenstein story. A point I want to make here is that it seems that nobody has been able to follow in their footsteps! Why? They didn't necessarily mean to just be scientificaly accurate. Their message was scientific humanism. It's the philosophy of being scientific that is portrayed in their books and not just robots and spaceships.Something else that needs to be pointed out is the difference between Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke. Some would suggest that Arthur C. Clark was more technically sophisticated than Isaac Asimov. Was Arthur C. Clark really all that technically sophisticated in his books? He had guys shooting through a vacuum to get to an A.I. computer gone haywire! Isaac Asimov has faster than light travel by means of space folding in his foundation books(a prediction that may not be so far off . . . in either technical accuracy or time; meaning it could happen sooner than you think!); he has mind reading; we have the ability to plus computers into brains and read what they're thinking and saying now; it's not mass produced(yet); but it's there. I for one only liked Isaac's first volume of his foundation books because he has this mind-reading which I didn't like; well what do I know?What seems to continue to set Isaac Asimov's Foundation appart is that of a galactic empire and how it dies(human neglect of rationalism). It should be noted that Isaac managed to connect his foundation books with his empire and robot books; so he shows how intelligence really grows to dominate a galaxy and then shows social ways that it can crumble(inspired by the fall of the roman empire).Despite Isaac's reliance on nuclear power as the high technology of the day his foundation books symbolizes the real issues facing humanity and not what you get on the news channels(actual politics channels; they just call them news channels); they seem to argue for the same things each election year but never solve the same problems! Meanwhile the science world keeps on chugging(word?lol!) along. ",4.0
" Parts of the book I really enjoyed. I appreciate the twists played by characters on one another. I felt that after reading through the entire bit though that not enough had actually taken place. I didn't feel I walked away with a story I could remember. I did read in one review that this was 'serious science fiction' so with that in mind I still give it five stars. I only would have liked that the pace be quicker.I really really enjoyedThe Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I would recommend that over this book Foundation based on my personal taste. ",4.0
" I find the Foundation series to be more interesting than the Robot series.

" I read this novel as a trilogy of Prelude to Foundation Foundation and Second Foundation. The story of the last years of the Trantor Empire helped me understand a lot about our society. Even though I read it in College I still have Harry Seldon name stock in my mind. Isaac uses this story to present his theories on how science and religion influence our society. It is a marvelous saga of a loooong story of a new Empire (USA?) build after the fall of an old one (Britain?). More or less this will be a very entertaining textbook on social science of history. A must for a serious SCFI reader. ",4.0
" First I will detail the faults of this book. It is too brief. Mr. Asimov was working under the assumption that he had to keep it under a certain length and so abbreviated it unfairly cutting certain amounts of plot and character development.That aside this book is excellent showing the struggle against adversity and brains versus brute force that is so lacking in most modern literature. It is true that Science Fiction is the Modern version of Romantic (the time period) literature and Asimov carried the beacon. ",4.0

" This is certainly an excellent 'first' book in the Asimov series. Even if one has not read Prelude to Foundation you can pick up right up and enjoy the series. Sets the stage for the next books in the series but also makes one think 'What would happen if America lost its power sources?' ",4.0
" I started reading this series with the original 'Foundation' and was very disappointed with it. After all the acclaim it received I was expecting something truly exceptional. Instead I got a historical narrative that is closer in style to something you would read in the Brittanica for a school assignment. It is really a kind of 'mutant' between a novel and a documentary. What's more it is exceptionally boring. What kept me going was the Asimov name on the cover and the hope of better things to come. This is not to say that it is a really bad book. I must confess that it has some interesting parts and of course the series as a whole is an absolute classic. Every other novel in the Foundation series is so brilliant that they cover for this disappointment. It must also be remembered that Asimov wrote this book in the early 50's when he was still a young and inexperienced writer ",4.0
" This is an awesome book but if you're looking for battles and Star Wars style action the sequels to this story have more. This novel spans the first 100 or so years of events that take place after the fall of a Galactic Empire. It's a very thin book and a quick read. Some terms such as 'Gallopin' Galaxies' appear in the book but be mindful of the times in which this book was written...and the intended audience.What is entertaining and interesting is how the characters solve Hari Seldon's predicted problems throughout the book. How cool would it be to have an entire planet of scientists (make that two)...a tiny portion of the galaxy that is pretty much responsible for running it. As a fantasy it's as fun to dream of scientists in charge as it is to imagine winning the lottery. You might even glean tactics for handling dopey managers or solving problems without going into combat. Asimov's wit and intrigue throughout make for an entertaining and thought-provoking read. ",4.0
" The first book in Asimov's Foundation Series is actually an anthology of stories tracing the formation of the Foundation to its growth into a competitor of the Galactic Empire. The premise is simple its execution complex",4.0
" The Foundation saga is one of the most widely-known sci-fi series ever published. Started in the 1940's with this book Foundation Asimov continued the series up through the 1980's at which point he was being basically threatened by fans to continue writing to satiate their reading interest.Foundation's setting is in the far-future when planets have not only been discovered and colonized but millions of planets have been organized into a Galactic Empire that spans thousands os star systems. Hyper-industry and nuclear power form the core to this civilization which seems to have an endless grasp on the future of civilization.That is until Hari Seldon a scientist discovers the science of psychohistory by which future events can be predicted based on calculations of human behavior. He foresess the collapse of the Empire based on inevitable social political and economic forces. He devises a plan to save humankind from an imminent dark age by instituting a scientific Foundation at the edge of the galaxy.This premise is what drew me to the read the book. What exciting prospects! The opportunity to plumb the mind of the genous Hari Seldon. To get a closer look at this Galactic Empire whose proportions were mindboggling. To understand at a more nuts and bolts level this 'psychohistory.' To see what Hari Seldon has up his sleeve.Unfortunately though the book provides an historical fiction that encompasses 300 years of life after Hari Seldon and introduces leaders of his Foundation that are memorable for their nerve and intellect some of the imaginative possibilities such as most of those mentioned above are not fully realized. I am not sure if they are realized in other books of the series but I guess that's for someone else to comment on.Foundation came to me highly recommended. I am not new to science fiction but I have not read that much of this genre. I was looking forward to something that would really blow my mind away. Though I admired several things about the book and thought it was a nice read I am not going to read the other books in this series. Coming away from this book I felt it was good but not much more. There were several ways in which I clearly found the book to be lacking in addition to the brevity of focus on Hari a good discussion of psychohistory or much emphasis on the Galactic Empire.Though Asimov's style is surely concise and highly readable he views plot as the central element to his writing at the expense of other aspects of great fiction that really should have been incorporated. I will outline these at length because it appears that the book's praises are already sung widely.First there is not much character development. Characters are presented merely to accomplish a historical event in the flow of the story. We get a feel for the characters not as real people but as actors on the stage of world history. Though the reader admires the nerve and intellect behind each of these heroes (there are 5 heroes that are portrayed in the generation following Hari) there is little else that makes them interesting. While this kind of presentation of characters may work in movie adaptations or history textbooks I like to view my characters as a little more than men-at-work. Everybody is always scheming there's not much downtime or description of what day-to-day life is like with these guys so far in the future such far-off planets. The dialogue is great though and that's part of the reason the book is a quick read.Secondly there is a lack of real meaning or symbolism that defines great books. There's not much refelction on the part of the narrator or poignancy. The closest we get to intrinsic meaning is the interesting description of the false religion that a protagonist Salvor Hardin invents in order to undermine the economy of a neighboring state. Religion is also used to manipulate other planets. Hard to swallow this helps us understand what the author probably thinks about organized religion. The book is also full of cute phrases that portray the all-importance of technology in Asimov's future",4.0
" Foundation is great science fiction for the scientific minded no deus ex machina here. The only fault I find with this 1st book is that the 3 main characters are exactly the same person. Seldon Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow are the exact same character. All calm cool and collected. Perfectly confident and perfectly logical. No difference in dialogue and problem solving skills you wouldn't be able to tell from Asimov's writing that these characters are from different time periods and are from different cultures. For that matter every character in the book seems to be of the same culture and dialect. I realize Asimov uses a minimalist style of writing like Hemmingway there are good and bad sides to this. No fleshing out of characters has to be considered weakness in Asimov's writing. It may have made for a longer book but his characters would have been better served if they all didn't behave as robots. ",4.0
" Isaac Asimov is one of the few popular science fiction writers whose fame is derived mostly from his intriguing story line and character interactions as oppose to pure imaginative science. In fact given that this series takes place 50000 years into the future one could easily argue that its incredibly short sighted given how little science has evolved; yet this detracts very little from just how entertaining this book and the series is. Asimov is a fantastic writer in terms of creating intrigue wit and believable dialog and the result is he has developed a very enjoyable series.Foundation is the first book of the original three that Asimov wrote in the Foundations series and although the series is now quite a collection of books with some even taking place before the period of this book Foundation still represents a terrific point to enter the series. The premise is that a science exists that is able to predict the downfall of an empire that ruled the galaxy for 20000 years and as a result a foundation (two in fact) is set up to ultimately shorten the period of anarchy that will result in the empire's downfall. This of course leaves open plenty of intriguing possibilities and Asimov does not disappoint.Asimov is very straight forward in his writing and leaves little open to interpretation. He has often been criticized for this style yet in place of open ended complexities the book contains a quality that fully immerses its readers and satisfies them with clear and definitive answers. Reading the foundation novels is somewhat akin reading a history book that that highlights specific elements of importance. This style may not appeal to everyone but once you are engrossed in the story line you will find it hard to put this book down (as well as many others in the series).***For those new to the series here are the specific seven books tied directly into the Foundation story line and their original date of publication. I read these in the order they were published and was very happy to have chosen that order. Asimov also tied in some of this other book series into this one (specifically his Robot series) thus making the entire story line a much larger volume of books.Prelude to Foundation (1988)Forward the Foundation (1993)Foundation (1951)Foundation and Empire (1952)Second Foundation (1953)Foundation's Edge (1982)Foundation and Earth (1986) ",4.0

" Interplanetary conflict and scientific religion dominate this wonderful SF world created by a diverse knowledge of writing and our history to mesh Isaac Asimov's knowledge into a symbolic tale.'Psycho historian' Hari Seldon predicts that the city of Terminus will be destroyed as well as the entire Galactic Empire. This Armageddon is foreseen into 3000 years of barbaric emptiness. Dr. Seldon comes up with an idea that a group of psycho historians will need to work together with Seldon so that they can compose an Encyclopedia of the Galaxy's history to prevent about 2000 years of political unrest. A Foundation is created. This Foundation represents the community of these historians to produce enough updated volumes of this Encyclopedia every 50 years so that the rivalry that will occur between the time Seldon dies and this Galaxy destruction occurs it's ready to be of service to those struggling in the future. I found that the most interesting piece of this whole story is that as the struggles get stronger between the Foundation's cycle leaders and the surrounding planet's 'prefects' the leaders of the Foundation start to create this religion amongst the science involved with the Encyclopedia. These religious 'high priests' become the power and influence amongst these interplanetary societies. It's so great to see how the higher power called the Galactic Spirit is slowly becoming a widespread belief amongst the psychohistorians and their counter parts.I keep thinking about the impact of these thoughts and ideas on our own society and how similar some of these reactions would be. I see a lot of conflict between our country the United States and Middle Eastern countries where we are planting ourselves on other's territory so that we can suck from their few and far between plentiful resources that are of high value to us so we make these deals that are appealing to 2nd and 3rd class countries and once that is started we ultimatley have all of this say over what that country is up to. I feel like Foundation shows how this peaceful and well- intentioned planet is working to create righteous things and there are these outside planets wanting control over how they are going about this and need some sort of power over a smaller community in a self-serving way. The character development is my favorite part of the book because of the different personalities that Asimov creates to work out the story line of the book. The different leaders are these very he-men type characters that are young and self-righteous working towards the destruction or protection of their homeland.Clashing righteoussness is all over this book and I think that it definaltey symbolizes some of the conflict that exists in our own country today. I did not however feel like Asmiov gave women any role at all. I can't think of one woman that played ANY major role in this book and when there was a mention of a woman she was nothing but a secretary or a mediator of some sort. I felt like there were just too many hormones flying around this book and I kind of wonder what this says about Isaac Asimov and his life. A great writer but maybe needs a love life? All around this was a great book and I recommend to all of you die hard SF fans!!! If you're a hardcore gal that is in to SF I would pass on this book. ",4.0
" I enjoyed this book when I read it a couple of years ago and it is still ok I guess. ",4.0
" I thought the book was somewhat dull compared to the first 'Foundation' novel because there are no brilliant characters such as Salvor Hardin or Hober Mallow and no great accomplishments. The first part of the book about Foundation's struggle against the Empire is not impressive. The second part about the Mule was moving sort of slow until a brilliant ending. I was absolutely shocked at it and I thought that it was definitely worth reading the entire novel for the ending. In fact the emotion that I experienced must have been something like what people influenced by the Mule felt! I also realized I had a great affection for the Mule it is fabulous that a person who is predicted to be a pathetic loser in life makes it beyond all expectations. I know that the Mule is supposed to be a bad guy so now that I am reading 'Second Foundation' I hope that its ending would not be overly dramatic for him. ",4.0
" Asimov continues with his narration of the history of the interregnum between empires in pretty much the same anthology format used in Foundation. Actually upon further thinking there's probably no way really to tell the story of a 1000 year journey on the part of humanity without doing it in snippets. More and more the series begins to read more like a history book with some dramatic events being highlighted for their importance as turning points. These turning points are called Seldon Crises foreseen events by Hari Seldon Psychohistorian which impel the people of the Foundation forward to galactic dominance. Throughout the first book and a half Asimov establishes a bit of fatalism - nothing can stop the foundation by historical imperative and for that reason the people of the Foundation especially it's leadership become apathetic.Asimov throws a wrench into the status quo with the rise of a mutant a statistical improbability and anomaly that could not possibly be accounted for in the creation of the Seldon Plan and therefore the first truly unknown quantity with the ability to destroy the Foundation. This mutant called the Mule has psychic ability and the great revival of technology in the Foundation is powerless to stop him from manipulating people and working his way to dominance. The Mule consolidates his power takes over the Foundation and destroys the remnants of the former galactic empire and it looks like Seldon's prophecies could be wrong. That a single individual upset the 1000 year plan to turn the Foundation into the Second Empire in only 5 years.Asimov again explores the themes of individuality stagnation complacency and religion. Choice and free will are major foci for the novel. If the Seldon Plan is mathematically and psychologically accurate like a prophecy if certain things are meant to happen just because human beings will predictably react in the same ways in given situations do we really have free will? What is the role of the individual in society in in the historical process? Asimov treats history like a Marxist influenced by Hegelian dialectics. Conflicts and crises between opposing forces give birth to a third new status quo until it comes into conflict with an opposing force. These moments of intersection are the Crises predicted by Seldon and the focus of Asimov's 1000 year narrative. But the Mule changes that. He challenges the notion of inevitability and proves the fallibility of Seldon's prophecies. But by doing so he introduces another free will paradox. The Mule has the ability to modify emotions and create complete loyalty in people. He wins victories by converting the opposing sides' generals and leaders into giving up and then serving him destroying free will again by creating it out of the tight confines of the Seldon Plan. It's truly and interesting concept. How will the Mule be stopped? Enter",4.0

I would wholeheartedly recommend any of his various books to friends and family but I wouldn't expect them to come away really grappling with social issues or anything afterwards. Don't get me wrong- he does go after social issues and examines some things in interesting ways that can be somewhat eye-opening if you're the kind of person who never thinks that way but it's just not earth-shattering.This sounds horrible... but I don't mean it to.

" The original Foundation trilogy is today revered as one of the best works of science fiction by a veritable giant of the genre Isaac Asimov. Begun originally as a series of eight short stories published in Astounding Magazine between 1942 and 1950 the first four were collected and published for the first time in 1951 under the title of Foundation.The Galactic Empire has ruled the galaxy in splendor magnificence and domination for the last twelve thousand years but now its significant chapter is coming to a close; only no seems to realize this except Hari Sheldon. Through the revolutionary science of psychohistory Sheldon has calculated that in five centuries the empire will come to an end and the galaxy will devolve into a hostile barbarian world that he has predicted to last thirty thousand years. But Sheldon has a plan to cut this time of the dark ages down to a mere millennium. It will take decades and centuries of planning with the initial creation of the galactic encyclopedia where all knowledge and record will be stored and kept for the future. To make this happen he creates a small civilization on a remote planet that he names Foundation. Only through the years and decades warlords rise up around the galaxy looking to take down the Foundation and it is up to Sheldon's planning for the encyclopedia and this small civilization to survive.In Foundation Asimov doesn't focus greatly on complex character development (or female characters of merit for that matter) but takes the sociological made-up science of psychohistory and has fun with exploring just what one can do with a world over a period of decades.Originally written on February 4 2011.Go to[...]for over 500 book reviews and over 50 exclusive author interviews.

" Think of it as social science fiction. It begins a thousand-year project that through the cleaver acions of the protagonists attempts to save humanity from a prolonged and chaotic interstellar Dark Age that was bound to follow the collapse of the Galactic Empire. Through the use of a mathematical application on history(as well as psychology and sociology) called Pschohistory the founder of that field of study (Hari Seldon) developed a plan to truncate the Dark Age period from 10000 years to 1000 years.He begins this plan by setting up a colony on a planet at the rim of the galaxy called Terminus called the Foundation. From then on the inhabitants and their descendants of Terminus choose certain actions and follow certain policies that do not always make sense to the reader until or to other characters. Sometimes the Foudation seems to be self-desctructing or that the leaders are being treacherous. But not is all that it seems. Every once in a while sometimes after 50 years or 30 years the Foudation is in a situation that either spells destruction or conquest by a neighboring kingdom. This is referred to as a Seldon Crisis. This is usually a turning point in the Foudation's path of history that was calcutaed by Seldon and part of his plan to bring about the New Galactic Empire after the fall of the old one. The important part is that Seldon Crises or the events thta bring them about are done through clever acts of political economic or diplomatic manipulation. (Even psychological) What is most important to the plan is that Seldon needed the Foundation to be unaware of the path the people of Terminus must take. Thus there are few social and psychological scholars to notice the trends and provide warning. THis way the actions taken are contolled for the sake of executing the Seldon plan.I did enjoy the book and will be reading and reportin on the sequels in the future. I thought it was cleaver and insightful on human nature as wellas a good understaning of history without hitting me over the head with it. The collapse of the Galactic Empire which stretches into the sequels is a clear reference to the long (relatively) fall of fthe Roman Empire. It seems that just like the Romans the Galactic Empire will not be comquerds in on campaign liike Alexander did to Persia but instead eveolve into another form of civilation with competeing factions comparable to the Catholic Church the absolute (so-called) ruling kings the nobles the equestrians and the outside threats such as muslim caliphs. The book was originally published in 1951 AD so it did not anticpate specifc technologies and the referce to nuclear power as 'atomics' is a bit outdated. I would have hoped for nuclear fusion or the equivalent of such an epic transfornmation. Also a bigger role for women characters other than the harpie wife of a foriegn aggressor in the book would have been nice. Maybe because I was reading Steig Larsson and some Star Wars novels recently I had gotten used to female protagonsts and antagonists. But FOUNDATION was written long ago and the audience for this genre was and may still be male dominated. There are sequels and prequels to for me to explore and for Asimov to redeem himself. JK. (Observe I wrote one of those texting acronyms.) I just hope every character does not have sound like Isaac Asomov. (as much as love him) Out of a galaxy I give it 878124550100 stars.

" Slow on the pick up as many of the early characters are not developed very well making it difficult to sink into.

" I liked this book. I don't really have anything profound to say I'm only writing a review because for some reason Amazon is not giving me the option of rating the book without a review.Asimov seems to have an interesting twist on European history in this book as the events that occur in it seem to parallel the fall of the Roman Empire the successor Germanic kingdoms and the rise of the merchant class in the Renaissance. Understanding the history of Western Civilization probably has given me a fun comparison to Asimov's fictional Galactic history. ",4.0

" I came into this one never having read anything by Asimov even though I had heard and saw his influence so heavily on science fiction. I picked up the first one I found and it happened to be this one so why not give it a go?I was intrigued right from the beginning drawn into the story easily. Asimov's style of writing is fluid and engaging easily allowing the reader to picture and understand everything. In addition the plot came together nicely and in a simplistic complexity (oxymoron?) you were able to see the growth of the Foundation from a fledgling world to... well I won't reveal anything suffice it to say the natural progression that Asimov portrayed fit together very nicely.My only complaints with Asimov though was that it did come together to nice and neat never really engaging the reader to the extent of wondering thinking feeling and diving into the story. Instead you are almost lead from A to B to C without any guessing and wondering without any involvement with everything almost being a foregone conclusion. Add to this his style of writing is a bit simplistic in that there isn't anything too complex which isn't altogether bad because he backs it up with a fluid and believable plot that is more than enough to add credence to the story. In fact we've seen this in fantasy as well as David Eddings wrote simplistically but backed it up with a story that was enjoyable to read.I will definitely read Asimov again especially the rest of the series if only to what Asimov would do being a pioneer of the genre. I would certainly recommend Asimov to anyone looking to start reading science fiction and/or a light quick read. A recommend.3.75 stars. ",4.0
" 'Foundation and Empire' by Issac AsimovTwo hundred years have passed of the 300 Hari Seldon predicted it would take for the Empire to fall. All things have gone according to the Seldon plan and the Foundation is one of the most powerful states in the galaxy. This might change though because there are 2 more Seldon Crises on the horizon.This is another good addition to Foundation trilogy but as is typically the case not quite as good as the first. Foundation and Empire covers the next period of time for the foundation when the Foundation is finally brought back to the attention of what remains of the Empire. The Empire has heard of the power the Foundation now wields and views them as a threat and two different generations of Empire men seek to remedy that threat...The Good",4.0
" While the book does offer a promising premise the necessary jumps from one point in time to another do not make for a pleasant read. The very first time I attempted to read the book I was unable to get much further than the first part (The Psycho- Historians). As soon as you begin to get used the characters a shift takes place. Unfortunately this happens again and again. When you read Foundation it becomes neccesary to think of each of the five parts as a short story.While the story was displayed in the best way I could imagine the classic simply did not live up to my expectations. The emphasis is on the plot and very little is put into the characters. While the book has it's flaws I find it simply amazing when the date it was published is taken into consideration. Put simply it's like the majority of 'classics' out there; while they were astounding in their own time they simply can't stand up to the best of modern modern literature out there. ",4.0
" A trilogy consists of three books so even although 'Foundation' (one of the true classics) is good enough to be a trilogy by itself formally 'Foundation' needed two more volumes to make up a trilogy. In these two volumes the level does not fall off too badly although 'the Mule' is rather weak.Unfortunately Asimov one of the truly greats of SF later succumbed to undue pressure and combined his Robot-series (already in itself continued too long) with the Foundation with outright embarrassing results. The original three books were quite enough thank you! ",4.0
" The great thing about Foundation is it's scope. It's a bit unsettling at times that you don't really get to know a character considerably well as the parts of the book break down over the span of several generations but reading everything unfold and the implications that the events have in the long term is really fascinating.Asimov's writing is a mixed bag. It's imaginative and has a great vision. But at times the people seem too... squeaky-clean to be people. Every character seems unrealistically eloquent and proper and the dialogue doesn't fall too far from what I'd imagine Asmiov may say himself. There are few differences between the characters in regards to linguistic tendancies. Also and I know the book was first published in the early 50's but there are hardly any women even mentioned in Foundation and they certainly don't play significant or visible roles.It's still quite imaginative and quite good in spite of these flaws. I understand Asimov was my age (21) when he began writing Foundation so taking that in consideration it seems like an even more awesome literary feat. ",4.0

" The start of Asimov's highly influential groundbreaking future history series. The invention of the science of psychohistory captivated me the first time I read it. Basically all those with an interest in SF should check this out.Asimov's intro gives some history of the evolution of this series with his editor Campbell as well as some entertaining silliness by the publisher Doubleday. He tells how they wouldn't publish him at one time and later on they are at his door cap in hand asking for a new book.Foundation ",4.0

" This is a classic series of galaxy rebuilding. These books combine stories that jump hundreds of years to become a history of the Foundation. This is a new and different way to look at science fiction writing that has created many copycats.

Science fiction writing is all about the concept and the Foundation series has a concept that can produce books for years to come. ",4.0
" The Foundation trilogy is really a rebinding of stories published serially in Astounding Magazine so each part really stands on its own making only passing references to previous stories and explaining anything necessary to the current plot.Asimov's writing is rather dialog-heavy and evolves slowly enough that I couldn't get past the first book when I read it the first time (in high school). Coming back to it years later I've really enjoyed these three volumes and am looking forward to reading the extension novels by Greg Bear and David Brin two of my favorite authors (and the reason I picked up Foundation again). It's not as slow as Lord of the Rings (also worthwhile for those with patience).The story is very interesting and lets you into the psyche of the characters only through their words and actions so your understanding of them builds slowly through your reading.I definitely recommend Foundation. I also read Bujold's 'Warrior's Apprentice' recently which I find to be similar in style and I recommend that as well. ",4.0
" This is the second volume published of Asimov's classic Foundation series (originally published as two novellas in 1945). Part I is titled 'The General.' A military leader in the Old Empire sees the Foundation as a threat (about forty years after the end of the events described in 'Foundation'). He gets permission from the emperor to wage a campaign. The Foundation must find a way to stop him. Fortunately the mathematics of Hari Seldon has already considered a course of action. In Part II called 'The Mule' a mutant with unparalleled power (power never considered in Hari Seldon's psychohistory; he can control the emotions and commitments of others) fights and defeats the Foundation about 300 years after the start of the novel 'Foundation.' But now the Mule has to go in search of the Second Foundation which is made up of psychologists and psychohistorians (the First Foundation had been set up primarily with physical scientists). When 'The Mule' appeared in magazine format in 1945 it wowed the readership. With these stories the series really began developing a following. I am in my 50s and have read the books a couple of times. But my father has read them ten times! ",4.0
" Many consider Foundation a Sci-Fi classic while others concider it a poorly written boring piece of something I really shouldn't mention by name.I personally fall within the first category I liked this book a lot. But although I myself loved this novel and its sequels I do can imagine why other people simply hated it.Those who don't like it usally refer to the fact that there is virtually no character development no action of any kind whatsoever and that the technology used seems outright 'retro' (nuclear trashcans and the like).All of this critism is undoutably true. Since this book is actually a collection of a series of short stories and all of those are about different eras in the history of the Foundation Asimov has to replace most of his characters every 50 to 100 pages which leaves room nor reason for descent characters.And since the story focusses promary on events in the future 'history' of mankind and the reasons they take place most of what happens is people talking to other people with only small references to battles wars and sofort.Finally lest not forget that these stories were written when the last century was only halfway over. Nuclear trashcans atomic guns and typwriter-isch computers were perfectly plausable back then.The point I am trying to make with this review is that this book is about a subject that simply isn't everybody's cup of tea. Foundation is nowhere near as accessible as Sci-Fi series such as Star Wars Star Trek or Babylon 5 (all good series in their own right). Or even like the more famous classic Sci-Fi novels such as '2001",4.0
" Foundation is a landmark in science fiction and epitomizes the best of what Isaac Asimov stood for. This book proves that you don't have to have a lot of sex and mindless violence ('-the last refuge of the incompetent') to make a book suspenseful and a page-turner. The book is entirely without action and romance in the normal sense and consists almost entirely of dialogue. What makes it so interesting is the ideas (and reversals of ideas) that it presents in all their aspects subsequently debates and solves. It has an aura of almost detective story fascination with regards to political ideas. What is interesting is that the book takes a pacifistic approach to politics and thereby forces itself to present a plausible solution to occurring problems (say rebellion anarchy and war) without degrading into violence. Each self-contained story (the book is not a novel but a collection of stories that were originally published stand-alone) is therefore a sort of logic puzzle (much the same in principle as Isaac's Robot stories) that you must delve into and accede all its ramifications and come out with an answer that will work without using violence. It's a credit to Asimov that he could not only achieve this but make it interesting and indeed arresting. This is an essential science fiction read and perhaps Asimov's apex. ",4.0
" I first read this book maybe 20 years ago when I was more accustomed to 'action' sci-fi replete with ray guns and space ships and trying to guess how such technology shaped society (a la Larry Niven to name one). This book is more like an historical novel or a future history like reading Gibbons or Kennedy. What is particularly astounding about this work which he first published in 1951 at age 31 is Asimov's ability to scale- from the drama of a handful of individuals to the seminal events of the last decades of the ancient galaxy-wide empire (which does not even remember its Earthly origin!). Unlike Heinlein's _Citizen of the Galaxy_ or _Friday_ (or many others) we do not follow the story of a single person or family in the backdrop of a civilization but rather the original Foundation trilogy makes both the individuals as well as the whole history of the galactic empire come alive in an extremely concise work. Here the context is just as important as the characters a scaling rarely seen elsewhere. This is the book's greatest strength- which becomes one of its weaknesses",4.0
" I found the politics of this novel interesting enough to disregard the dated scientific references. Seldon and his science was fascinating to behold and the plot was masterful. What concerned me was (dare I say it?) the fairly amateurish use of dialogue tags and the fact that each character seemed pretty much to speak with the same voice. Asimov wrote this as one of those authors who are at pains not to repeat 'he said'. So it must be a new tag each time no matter how ridiculous often paired with an adverb that makes you cringe",4.0
" 'Foundation and Empire' the second novel in Isaac Asimov's landmark science fiction series is a definite improvement on the first novel. The first novel was hardly a novel at all but rather a loose and uneven collection of short stories. 'Foundation and Empire' is actually two novellas and more care has obviously been taken with writing style pacing and character development.The second story 'The Mule' is perhaps the best of the entire Foundation series. The characters are enjoyably real and likable and there are two masterful surprises at the end.The entire Foundation series is essential reading for any science fiction fan. ",4.0
" Welcome to the second book in the Foundation trilogy (although Asimov did write further books it was a trilogy originally). The book picks up where Foundation left off - the Foundation has established itself as a formidable force in the Periphery of the Galaxy. Of course everyone is too well aware that gaining control of the local warlords is small potatoes compared to what's to come. In Foundation and Empire the inevitable comes.As the previous novel Asimov has divided this into books however here there are only two. As a result he gets to explore the characters at more length then in Foundation. But again expect wonder amazement and enjoyment at the themes issues and grandeur of this book not the characterisation and 'literary' qualities.In the first book the conflict between the Foundation and what's left of the Empire develops. This however is a much bigger game - in the past the warlords barely out-war-powered the Foundation while here the Empire dwarfs it even in its twilight. As always something must be done other than a brute force tactic. Furthermore the 'heroes' of the Foundation are no more in the conflict there are no Mallows or Hardins to guide the political intrigue so it is here that Seldon's plan is put to the ultimate test.In the second book (not to give away too much) a new threat to the Plan arises. A man known only as the Mule comes to light. And for the first time an individual drastically changes the course of history. Indeed he consists of the biggest threat to the plan thus far. What's so special about him?.. Personally I found this book the most enjoyable in the whole trilogy - it reminds me of the little cryptic 'detective' plotting from other Asimov works I read such as I Robot and Steel Caves. However here it's an almost perfect melodrama played out (and unlike many detective elements in novels includingthose of Asimov - this one doesn't seem contrived or make you feel at all 'cheated') as we follow some Foundationers in their quest to find out what the Mule is and how to deal with him.This is a great continuation of the saga and will also bring out many interesting questions - like whether an individual can change the course of history. It will also shake up your conception of the Seldon plan - overall a great book. ",4.0
" Political space tales aren't really my thing but I must say that politics aside I was astonished that Asimov was so young when he wrote this. Few writers can write such good prose before middle-age. The story itself is rather mundane for a true sci-fi enthusiast. You'll not find any great discoveries by astronaut explorers or the like but what it does do it does well. His treatment of religion is silly though and like most atheist writers it's not very well thought out. I've not read anything else by him but one hopes his later novels were better developed in that area. The mystical hints that run through nearly all of Arthur C Clarke's stories are the most intriguing thing about them. Asimov would have done well to have studied them. ",4.0
" More like 4.975 Stars. If we had more books like this who would watch TV. This book should be required reading in College Literature classes. I would love to see a well produced movie(s) for the Foundation Series - But nothing could ever be as entertaining as Asimov's fluid writing. ",4.0
" I really liked Foundation. Then I really liked the first part ('The General') of this. And then the Mule showed up... First Asimov always had trouble writing a mystery. I identified the Mule the first time he showed up and I figured out the basics of his mutation as soon as the Visi-Sensor was described. And that leads me to my second nitpick. The Mule didn't need to have such a powerful ability to affect others. The ability to read minds plus high intelligence would give the Mule the same ability to predict reactions as a trained psychohistorian and the Visi-Sensor would give him the tool to exploit it. The story itself would go much the same way with the Mule's ability to force predicted reactions replacing his ability to force actions but with a tighter integration with the ideas of the previous book. Furthermore it would have meant none of the psychic conspiracies which proceeded to dominate in the books Second Foundation Foundation's Edge etc. The ability to twist minds transforms psychohistory from the powerful science of Foundation to simply a method of forecasting the societal impact of psychic manipulation. It also transformed the Foundation series from moderately hard SF stories about the impact of a new science to just another set of stories about mind control magic. BTW I like fantasy and soft SF -- I just wish Foundation didn't change genres in mid-trilogy. ",4.0
" My 14 year old loves science fiction and fantasy and I've introduced him and reintroduced myself to some of the Classic Works of the Genre that Predate Star Wars and Serenity.Its been at least 20 years since I first read the trilogy. I had completely forgotten that the books are several self contained novella's that show the evolution of Hari Seldon's plan to keep the dark ages from the fall of the First Empire to the creation of a second empire confined to a period of a single millenia.He foresees a set of crisises that can only be managed with one solution every 75 years or so to increase the power of the foundation. Some are solved by trickery some are resolved by Religion and some by economics.I didn't notice until this reading that each 'crisis' that emerges is resolved by someone thinking 'outside the box' of the people who resolved the previous crisis and are now controlling the reins of the Foundation.Classic scifi from the Golden Age before Star Wars. If you're tired of the force return to a simpler era. ",4.0
" This is the second of the three novels in the original 'Foundation Trilogy' which was published in 1952 by Gnome Press. An edited version of it was published by Ace Books in the 1950s under the title 'The Man Who Upset The Universe'. It consists of two sections which are taken from shorter fiction that was published in 'Astounding Science Fiction' in the 1940s. While better than the first novel in the series there are still some weaknesses as a result of age. Asimov himself wrote in 1982 that the knowledge of astronomy at that time was 'primitive' and that he could now take advantage of electronic computers in his stories which hadn't been invented until he was halfway through the series in the 40s.The two sections of 'Foundation And Empire' are",4.0

" I Read this book 30 years ago. Wanted to refresh my memory. Am glad I did! Now on to Foundation and Empire. ",4.0
" Unlike the first Foundation book which was a series of related but not inter-connected stories Foundation and Empire has two longer stories. This lets Asimov flesh out the stories more adding detail and plot intricacies. The first story The Big and The Little is not one of the series' strongest. However the second story The Mule is the masterpiece of the series. It tells of a muntant The Mule who falls outside the scope of Hari Seldon's psychohistory as one supremely powerful individual. The story is told in almost detective story fashion similar to the first two Robot novels. It's quite as suspenseful and involving as Asimov at his best and one of his utmost classics. There's quite a lot of plot tangling and twists and the ending is a shocker. It's not quite a cliffhanger but will definitely make you want to read the next book which is great also. The whole series comes highly recommended. ",4.0
" This was probably my fourth reading of the book and what can I say? I highly recommend it.My brief review is this. The book is a lot of fun to read has some excellent characters and a very intriguing plot. For a little more detail continue reading.I'll start with three specific observations.FIRSTGeorge Lucas was impregnated by the Foundation prior to the birth of Star Wars.Let's check off some parallels. Decadent empire in decline? Check. Deep space religion? Check. Traders/smugglers with a wild-west attitude? Check. Central planet is entirely one city? Check.If you are a Star Wars fan and have NOT read this book these little hints alone should be reason for you to check it out.I'm not discrediting GL for his development of Star Wars simply identifying a primary source of his inspiration.SECONDThese short stories which became this novel were originally written in the 40's. Given that the stories are written before the computer age it's really easy to forgive what technologies he didn't anticipate and appreciate the development of his futuristic world and its own technology.However it is interesting to note that the technological innovations of the Foundation anticipate to some degree the technological phenomenon we see everywhere in that devices get smaller and smaller but more and more powerful. The main difference is that the Foundation's limited resource was metal while our real world limitations are more related to energy.THIRDThe scary point? That even in decline certain civilizations can produce their most advanced achievements. These achievements are however quickly lost as the downward impetus of that civilization is too great to escape its destiny with implosion.Yikes!I think I'll end with that. Have a nice day! ",4.0
" I love classic sci-fi in all it's wondrous unbelievability. I like stories where humans go to venus and find rainforests and go to mars and establish colonies and can breathe for no reason at all. It's way off science fact. but it's awesome. There's a nostalgic feeling to it that makes me feel comfortable and happy.I've never read anything by Asimov before so i thought i'd start with his multi-part epic classic. The Foundation series takes place in the far far distant future when humanity has spread itself across the entire galaxy. They live in a political empire quadrillions of people on billions of planets unified for millenia under one system advanced strong and stable. Enter Hari Seldon a psychohistorian (aka a mathematician who can use advanced formulas and sociology to predict the future with absolute certainty). Seldon predicts the demise of the Empire and a period of chaos a new dark age that will last for 30000 years unless he takes direct action to preserve all of human knowledge and make subtle changes to reduce those 30000 years of disunity to a mere 1000. I know. A 1000 year long story. Epic. Seldon is tried for treason and disruption of the peace of the empire but convinces the leadership of his theories and sets up the Foundation responsible for the construction of an encyclopedia galactica to preserve all human knowledge on the rim of the galaxy away from the turmoil about to unfold.From this introduction Asimov proceeds to tell his story in almost like an anthology format. We see major figures and major events from each generation and how the members of the Foundation deal with crises that lead them to the forging of a new empire conquering the darkness chaos and barbarism that spreads across the galaxy in the wake of the fall of the first empire. There are wonderful themes explored from fate predestination individuality change and religion. This last is probably the most powerful for me. In the wake of the collapse of civilized society and it's technological wonders the Foundation finds itself the only group of humans with advanced technology (mainly nuclear power). The other bands of humans whose tech has fallen into disrepair looks upon this advanced technology and science as magic and the Foundation is quick to seize upon this and make a new religion out of the science teaching 'priests' how to repair and use the technology to further their own power and domination in the galaxy. An interesting concept.Asimov is a brilliant sociologist and finds interesting ways to resolve immense political and economic crises. The series is well thought out and brilliantly executed. So why four stars? Well the scope of the story is so large that there are innumerable characters to keep track of and develop. Asimov does a fantastic job at that but I never really identify with anyone and just when I start liking someone they die and we move on to the next generation. This is more of a personal quibble than anything serious. Asimov forsees a great many modern technologies from the early 50s including video conferencing the internet and miniaturization of a lot of the gadgets available in the 50s a trend we see continuing today. Looking forward to the second book. ",4.0
" Isaac Asimov's Foundation series portrays a tremendous sweep of future history. Published in 1951 Foundation is the first book of this series (however Asimov would later write prequels to Foundation). Set many thousands of years into the future this book opens with a description of psychohistory and its founder Hari Seldon. Psychohistory is a branch of mathematics which deals with the reactions of human conglomerates to fixed social and economic stimuli. Mathematician Hari Seldon predicts a series of crises which will impact the Galactic Empire. Wanting to preserve knowledge Seldon sets up a foundation staffed with scholars and scientists.As Asimov wrote Foundation he was influenced by Edward Gibbon's multi-volume work History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. In fact Asimov read Gibbon's book not once but twice! It may be inferred that the emergence of Christianity during Roman times and the emergence of a new religion in Foundation are parallel events. What struck me about this book is that it is primarily composed of dialogue. I also found it interesting that Asimov has newspapers and tobacco still in existence so far into the future. I did like this book and I look forward to reading additional volumes in this epic science fiction series. ",4.0
" I read this book after coming blind to the foundation books - I've never read Asimov in a novel before. I've noted how Asimov when writing the books was very much a part of his time. When a character doesn't smoke it is a character trait to point out where everyone else smokes by course. Also sexism is taken for granted and when a female character assumes to be treated with equal rights it is a place for comment. I had hoped that we would have found better ways to get high and allowed more equality that far into the future but I suppose smoke 'em if you got 'em.Anyways I like this book better than the previous one because there are characters that you can root for and unexpected jerks in the plot-line and a more linear narrative based on the fact that a lot of the exposition is out of the way from the first book. I now cannot wait for the finale of the original series and debate weather to read the other three ancillary books that Asimov wrote later. ",4.0
" This is the first book in the extremely popular Foundation trilogy. Asimov has this clever idea that extensive control of the population requires religion technology and the guise of freedom.In reading the introduction by Asimov he reveals the Foundation story was created after completing Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.The story is full of political intrigue and religious power-plays.Some of my highlights from the book",4.0
" Really an enjoyable book to read. Asimov had such a hard task in this book introducing his readers to a large span of history. Most of the book maintained immersion but the smoking of the characters threw me off a bit (I wish someone would go through and pull the smoking out as well as the newspapers and change them to something else). Many people complain about character development being non existent in this book but character wasn't the point of this work. I have never seen another author try in under 300 pages to cover the span of time covered in Foundation. For the constriction he put himself under the characters are developed as far as they need to be with broad strokes.For people who are critical of this work read contemporaries of Asimov and you will find that only he Bradbury Herbert and a few others even bother to develop characters. Most Scifi doesn't even bother to develop the science enough to stand on it's own. In this case Asimov simply developed what he knew on the time through scaling the size and using hyperspace to solve distance problems so it was easy to accept every premise he laid down (well except for the smoking...)The whole point of the premise is that the main characters all have an inkling that there CAN BE NO HERO for Seldon's plan to work. If at any point someone had acted with rash heroics his mathmatics would be rendered null and the decay of the galaxy would last for ten millennia instead of one. ",4.0
" This book is simply way out of this scarry scarred annoying world we are forced to live in called earth with all its stomach aches and dripping joints and footsores and boredom. But old Asimov gives you a chance to go way out of this into just plain gigantic empires and it's all so way past any human imagination it keeps you satisfied your poor little soft skin human body satisfied so long as you keep reading it. Asimmov knows really how to keep you out of it all as long as your nose in his pages. But what is too much a puzzle I just don't get is how so many people want to take a good fanstasy like his and say he is actually realistic this is the world we are going to make ourselves in a few hundred years or even sooner. But these people are totally missing the point I don't care even if Asimov himself wanted to make all this Foundation real oine day or hoped people would beause then if we are actually living in this sort of Foundation Empire then if you think about it we'll all actually just be back in boring old scratchy reality again that always feels sort of uncomfortable like velcro. They just don't get how the whole genre is called 'science fiction and FANTASY.' The two halfs go together like the inside and outside of your face. Keep reality out. Hooray for unreality and yummy unreality like this one. ",4.0
" Breathes there a teenager of the md-20th century with a love of science fiction who was not weaned on the Foundation series? All that sweeping drama testosterone-laden but basically non-violent (all the violence is simply swept into summarizing references to ships destroyed and cities ransacked) marching through decades without concentrating on anything really boring like character development emotional entanglements or the trappings of society. Not a single reference to such trash as classical music or stage shows or pop music or romance just sweeping views of a distant future (or could it have been the distant past?) with the means of traveling between stars in the galaxy in the flash of a gnat's eyelash.And yet . . . revisiting the beloved Foundation reading through the filter of a lifetime of experience cracks appear in the plaster and beneath them one finds that the lath is too widely spaced the bricks behind that lath are often without mortar and one can see the trees where bricks are missing. We live already in an age where technology has bypassed this particular Universe. Computers have become infinitely more pervasive than Asimov might have dreamed in his wildest fantasy for at the time of the writing they were mere collators of stacks of punched cards the transistor had yet to be introduced or shrunk to the size of a grain of sand much less a sub-microscopic speck imprinted by the millions on a tiny wafer of silicon.Asimov had enormous faith in the future of Humanity but he had no idea of how rapidly that future would approach - or how slowly humans would react and adapt to the challenges posed. No Empire can be established when information is instantaneously available to three-quarters of the population. Will an army composed of humans indefinitely repress an entire population composed of their friends family relatives? We see the answer in Libya in Egypt in Syria in Africa - where the mobile phone has allowed guerrilla tactics to be employed by any group whether terrorist or freedom-fighter or mall-invasion gangs or 'mothers against the death camps of dog pounds.'Human society has been transformed by 24/7 information availability - but the universe of the Foundation proposes a populace of ciphers acting in ignorance of facts that would already be generally available in the 21st century. 'Just Google it' or 'look it up in Wikipedia' is nowhere to be found. There is a project of the First Foundation to write a 'Galactic Encyclopedia' - yet it already exists in 2012.And yet that universe is immensely attractive reduced to comic book simplicity perfect for any adolescent (whether 14 or 74) to immerse himself - or very infrequently herself as this universe is truly misogynist",4.0
" Asimov is incredibly easy to read. His sentences are perfectly formed neither too long nor too decorated nor too sparse. He strikes the perfect balance for his type of story driving things forward consistently through description or dialogue whenever each is appropriate.This story takes place over a rather large time period and could really be considered a collection of closely related short fiction instead of a novel. It works well that way. We're only given information on the most exciting periods of time in the Foundation's history and we're left to fill in most of the blanks on our own.On the downside there wasn't much time to get to know any of the characters. I Robot follows the same two characters through several situations and you get to know something about them by the end (even if they are almost cardboard cutouts it works). In Foundation nobody lasts long enough to really care about.Despite that flaw it did what any good book should do- it made me interested in continuing the story. Luckily this is a long series. I'll have plenty of time to finish it. ",4.0

" Over a decade ago I checked this book out of the library only to return it later having read only a couple of pages. I bought a copy the other day and was pleasantly surprised.Asimov started writing the Foundation series when he was 21 and this novel was first published in 1951. In some ways the time period in which it was written can be seen. Nuclear power is envisioned as the be-all end-all of energy. People smoke (although the cure for cancer was apparently found so any carcinogenic effects would be annulled) and there's talk of 'microfilm records.'That said the story was well-written and the reader can clearly imagine the events depicted as plausible. There is an overarching narrative focusing more on the grand sweep of history but it is told in vignettes from the lives of key characters at important moments in time.'Foundation' is a clever book with a storyline that ages well. ",4.0
" After reading the whole trilogy I must say that the first installment still has the biggest impact for the single reason that this is where the whole grand idea was conceived and presented for the first time.The best aspect of this story is of course the awsome interplay between technology politics religion economy and culture within the galactic periphery in the immediate vicinity of planet Terminus the location of the so called First Foundation. This interplay is cleverly woven into a series of plots propelled by a handful of characters. That focus upon a few key characters in a sense brought the whole story down to earth (and for the better).The founder himself Hari Seldon is already long dead by the 2nd chapter but the plan he and his co-conspirators set in motion lingers on.Couple of problems are evident with the story and some suspension of disbelief is required to overcome them.First is the time scale in which the changes are set in. To put it simply descend of parts of the galaxy encompassing hundreds of planetary systems into that sort of technological and scientific barbarism' within mere 50 years is not belivable. Establishing a religion based on technology within 30 years after that is still kind of on the less belivable side but it depends strongly on the magnitude of the technological difference between barbarians' and the foundationeers so there is room for interpretation.Second is the technology itself. Nuclear fission has been known and used for 60 years and lost most of its appeal as the ultimate energy source of the future.In the meantime there has been countless ideas about alternative sources of energy much greater than fission and entirely possible (notably",4.0
" Imagine an empire so humongous it stretches across the Milky Way galaxy. Imagine a mathematical formula that can actually prove future events. Then imagine that formula predicts this galactic empire will soon crumble and a new dark ages lasting at least 30000 years will follow.If you can imagine all that you get the gist of Foundation by Isaac Asimov and the beginning of a highly regarded series of books in the science fiction genre.What happens next is a group of people try to find ways to circumnavigate though not necessarily halt the new approaching dark age.Asimov isn't for everyone and I can't admit to loving his prose. But his ideas for plots are top notch. This book and the series of books that follow it are proof of this.Asimov's writing is often considered too dense for the casual reader and there's some truth to this. If you like your science fiction with lots of action and ray guns and alien spaceships flying about Asimov isn't for you. But if you like hard science fiction based upon hard indepth science this Asimov is probably right for you especially the Foundation series. ",4.0
" A science fiction book where the science is more political than technological. Psychology had advanced to the point where mathematical models of mass psychology could predict large group social behavior far into the future ( rather like the meteorological models attempt to predict weather several days in advance). The predictions in this case extended over several centuries and predicted the galaxy would undergo a dark age in which civilized learning and behavior would decrease and collected knowledge could be lost. A Foundation was formed at the far edge of the galaxy with the sole job of organizing and saving all knowledge. Since the book takes place over a long period of time we follow the adventures of several heroes involved with the Foundation's effort to not only maintain knowledge (for the time when civilization will return) but to do so while maintaining peace. This was done first by creating a religion based on the fact that only the Foundation had technology most importantly nuclear power. This source of power needed by all then became an object of worship and priests were trained in how to present the dictates of the Foundation (Source of Power) as a reason for good behavior. When this sham began to fail it was found that trade between the high tech Foundation and the low tech other nations was more profitable than war and could maintain peace. This is the first book in a series of three so most likely the next book tells how the trade idea worked out. Although my description does make it sound boring I found it to be an interesting book the politics of which sound familiar in today's world - I may read the next in the series. ",4.0

" Asimov's Foundation Trilogy is seen as classic science fiction. Shockingly Foundation is hardly a classic. Its theme of history repeating itself is drilled into the readers head. However Foundation and Empire the second book in the trilogy continues with these themes with better fluency and character.'The General' continues with the stories of Foundation. General Bel Riose of the old empire tries to conquer the Foundation and Asimov once again reassures that Hari Seldon's plan can never go wrong. With this setup of reassurance and the death of the first empire Asimov raises the reader's hope that the Foundation will never fall.Immediately in 'The Mule' Asimov rattles his audience with the fear that the Foundation like the empire will fall. The Mule a mutant with psychic powers was not seen by Seldon's Plan. The conquest of the Foundation is unstoppable. The second part of the novel allows readers to actually know the characters. They are not just people who act but we can see their motifs. The end of the book is supposed to have many plot twist that shock the reader but with foreshadowing many revelations are undermined. Bayta one of the main characters has a deep dread every time something happens with the Mule. This gives away the identity of the Mule.Foundation and Empire is a great read through its despair and hopelessness. It left me on the edge of my seat scrambling for the next book. ",4.0
" It's taken me quite a while to get around to reading this one and I hesitate to review the first book of a trilogy when I haven't completed all 3 books but I figured I'd better get this one in while I can as it may take me another 10 years to finish the series.I'm surprised that it took me this long to finally read 'Foundation' by Isaac Asimov but I can say that I'm glad I did. Actually I didn't have high hopes going into it as I am not a big fan of Asimov's writing. While his technical approach is always entertaining he tends to become very stilted and ham-fisted when it comes to characterization. It was this quality that turned me off of 'I Robot' and almost got me to give him up completely; however seeing as the Foundation trilogy is regarded as a classic of the genre I had to give it a shot.As everyone has said over and over (and I'll do it too) the Foundation trilogy is a futuristic parallel of the fall of the Roman Empire and the following Dark Ages. Hari Seldon father of Psychohistory sees the writing on the wall and establishes the Foundation in order to buffer the fall of civilization and technology. The first book of the series 'Foundation' does a good job of setting the stage for what is to come. The book is told in 5 parts each one focusing on a different character or time period in the early history of the Galactic Empire's fall. Surprising to me Asimov actually does a fairly good job with his characterization. There's very little melodrama and the story is evenly paced holding up pretty well for a tale begun in 1941. The only complaints I have with the story are that the main characters always seem to be overly confident in themselves as if they are holding all the cards and can easily handle any adversity while blindfolded (presenting a tense situation fails if the protagonist has no concern or doubt for how things will be resolved). Also as the different parts of the story skip a hundred years here 30 years there etc. it may take some imagination on the reader's part to develop a 'big picture' of what the Empire is really going through. These are minor issues however and should not detract from enjoying the book.One last observation - I have noticed that Hari Seldon appears to be getting younger with each new printing of this book. My copy of 'Foundation' from the early '80s with cover art by Darrell Sweet shows a decrepit bent wizened Seldon (as I feel he should look). The next cover by Michael Whelan from the early '90s shows a more healthy and happy Seldon. The cover of the latest edition shown on this page features a Seldon who looks like he's about to jump out of his wheelchair and punch you out. You have to love that artistic license... ",4.0

" The foundation is setup to secretly monitor mankind through its darkest hours. It reminded me a little of Orwell's 1984. In placing humans away from the central government on a planet with few resources. They are forced to develop quickly. This is a novel more about political machinations than about action. The contradictions in human nature are here to analyze. The characters use guile spirit & cunning to survive. Some 80% of the book is dialogue & the character development is a bit shallow. Nonetheless Mr. Asimov portrays the future in poignant & diverse ways. The predicted conflict makes the story of galactic history entertaining especially since this was written in 1951. Some 7 years before Sputnik was launched. The author deserves praise for his imagination that was well ahead of his time. ",4.0
" For its time `Foundation' by Isaac Asimov was a tale that predicted futurism as the calculation of the eventual outcome of each technological economic progression that mankind could and would go through if it stuck to certain paths especially the implementation of the concept that 'small is better' with an economic drive that produces its best results when under stress such as wartime. This model is pretty much the way the world works today with technology leaps made when there is a demand for it to do so and at no time is this demand greater than when a nation is faced with a possible crisis. Asimov's `Foundation' is a story about a society of colonized scientists that have been chosen by Hari Seldon the creator of psychohistory who sees a crisis developing in the cosmic empire that can only be avoided if certain conditions are met for each impending emergency that is predicted through psychohistorical analysis. He sets up an off world colony at the unknown edge of the galaxy the foundation that goes through several generations with each generation reaching a hidden 'Seldon crisis' point that becomes the focus of several successive stories in the book. Futurism was actually an artistic movement originating in Italy around 1910 whose aim was to express the energetic dynamic and violent quality of contemporary life especially as embodied in the motion and force of modern machinery. Nowadays it means to believe that the meaning of life and one's personal fulfilment lie in the future and not in the present or past. Foundation symbolizes these ideas. Although not the most exciting or action packed SF you could read is also somewhat limited in its SF feel is more of a revelation of economics and is the kind of literary material that would impress the business and politically minded reader more than the seasoned SF reader. None-the-less this is still an important work that remains relevant today as it did in the early 50s but the sequels might be a bit of a hard sell on the bases of this educational SF novel. ",4.0
" I love this book and now fully understand why Asimov is considered one of the grandmasters of this genre. Over the years I have read a considerable amount of Science Fiction; books ranging from military exploits to technological exploits but never have I read one that I would consider high literature.In this book Asimov deals with issues such as religion politics economics and the control that they all grant in such a deft way that it in no way detracts from a riveting and page turning novel. Take for instance this quote from page 210.'The religion we have is our all-important instrument toward that end. With it we have brought the Four Kingdoms under our control even at the moment when they would have crushed us. It is the most potent device known with which to control men and worlds'In regards to the power of economics'The whole war is a battle between those two systems; between the Empire and the Foundation; between the big and the little. To seize control of a world they bribe with immense ships that can make war but lack all economic significance. We on the other hand bribe with little things useless in war but vital to prosperity and profits.' - Pg. 231My one complaint is really based on a personal preference. I really enjoy a novel which has one central character that I can get to know and even identify with. I think that it helps to draw the reader into the story. However Foundation covers several hundred years in just a couple hundred pages thereby making this impossible. This is a small point but for me detracts slightly from the story.That said I adore this book and am eagerly looking forward to finishing out the series.

" Foundation is the first book of Isaac Asimov's aptly named Foundation Trilogy. Foundation presents the premise that when examining large enough populations of people it becomes possible to predict their behavior stochastically (and sociologists become statisticians). The great psychologist of the day Dr. Seldon finds from his statistical data that there is going to be a great social collapse; and he creates two colonies (or foundations) that are designed to shorten the period of chaos the universe will experience before a renaissance occurs. Without giving too much away this novel is the story of the early years of one Foundation and its' experiences with the universe around them. This book makes one wonder just how much people act of their own volition and exactly to what extent we are all the same. Is it possible to predict the behavior simply by examining a large group? Another interesting sub-theme with this book that I found extremely interesting is that eventually there won't be any original thoughts; the example given is of archeology; the archeologists of Seldon's age assumed that there was no point in examining ruins; they simply read books written by the archeologists of earlier generations; it was assumed that there was nothing else to find. As people explore explain create and discover more and more of the universe will there eventually come a time that there is nothing else to find? ",4.0

" In a preface written in 1982 for a volume collecting the original 'Foundation' trilogy Asimov recalled the sources of inspiration for the series and boasted 'Why shouldn't I write of the Galactic Empire and of the return of feudalism. . . ? After all I had read Gibbon's 'Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire' not once but twice.'Edward Gibbon's influence is certainly obvious in 'Foundation.' A galactic empire centered in Trantor (a celestial Rome) is on the verge of collapse. During the Dark Ages that follow the surviving remnants at the extreme borders of the galaxy initially maintain control by creating a religion that hides scientific knowledge behind theological mysteries and by training a caste of priests to monopolize this learning. Asimov however goes beyond the period covered by Gibbon (who ended his masterwork with the age of the Crusades)",4.0
" The classic Foundation trilogy continues on pace in this second installment. The first half of this book is rather flat with uninspiring political wrangles and a story of the Empire's last general who is defeated by the Foundation and is never mentioned again. This episode has little effect on the overall flow of the story and is a curious piece of filler in this otherwise strong trilogy. However the second half of this book taking place many decades later more than makes up for it. Here we learn that Hari Seldon's once flawless predictions on the course of humanity throughout the galaxy are starting to break down because of the passage of huge amounts of time and the introduction of an unforeseen variable. This variable is a mutant known as The Mule who has strange mental powers that are outside the realm of Seldon's psychohistory and throw his ancient predictions out of whack. Soon both the Foundation and the Empire are in ruins and barbarism reigns throughout the galaxy. Only the mysterious Second Foundation which has not been heard from since Seldon's day can possibly help. Whether or not the Second Foundation can save the galaxy from the dark ages and whether this is all really a part of Seldon's plan after all are questions that arise in this book but are not answered. Thus we have an excellent intellectual cliffhanger that gives a great reason to continue to the third installment of the trilogy.There are two strange occurrences in this book that speak volumes on the time period in which Asimov wrote it that being the 1940's. First there is a prominent female character in this book which was nearly unheard of in the sci-fi of that area. Furthermore Asimov writes as if this is an amazing occurrence and other characters are shocked and uncomfortable with this woman's status as an 'equal' among the male characters around her. This sure seems strange today. Was Asimov slyly commenting on the state of women's rights back in mid-century or did he think he was making a grand statement about the future? Either way the sentiment is oddly outdated and even more oddly takes place in the distant future of humanity where I would hope things would have progressed. Finally in the second-to-last line of the book Asimov inserts a rather sick dirty joke through the use of a sly double entendre (the key word is 'mule').. Back in 1952 Asimov probably thought he was making a goofy in-joke to his learned friends that would not be caught by the general public. If that's the case the joke in question seems extremely silly and predictable today and brings the book to a close that is rather difficult to take seriously. ",4.0
" Clever twists incredible imagination and a fun quick read. Some of Asimov's ideas of future civilizations invoke awe even decades later. My only complaint is that the reader only gets to experience each generation for a single chapter so character development is tricky and brief. Not as good as Ender's Game but still worth reading.

" Prelude to Foundation describes the young mathematician Hari Seldon's flight from an entrenched galactic bureaucracy bent on destroying him and what he represents - a threat to the established political order.Foundation opens with Hari Seldon having successfully escaped his old enemies and having refined his new mathematical theory of statistically predictable human behavior (modeled on similarly ponderous equations of statistical mechanics)",4.0
" I never would have made it through this book if I hadn't read the other foundation novels first. Because this was originally published in magazines this book is very fragmented and hard to follow if you don't already know the story. Still I love Asimov. This is just so early he isn't excellent yet ",4.0
" This book is the second in the original Foundation Trilogy. The first book was 'Foundation' which introduced us to Hari Seldon psychohistory and Hari's plan to reduce 30000 years of chaos to a mere 1000 years. This book is two novelettes combined into one book and tells how the Foundation struggles to survive against the remnants of the galactic empire and then against a mutant whose coming Hari Seldon failed to predict.In the first part of this story we meet the General Bel Riose. I enjoyed the story but I kept getting the feeling that Bel Riose was being manipulated for most of the story. I assumed that Riose was being manipulated by the Foundation though it was also possible that the Second Foundation which we learn much more about in the second half of this book was also manipulating Riose. In spite of my perceived lack of suspense as I waited for Riose's inevitable defeat I did enjoy this half of the book while longing to get into the second half.In the second half of the book we meet a unique and unpredictable mutant called the Mule. The mutant is called the Mule for biological reasons. We also learn that the Mule was unpredicted by Hari Seldon. The Mule realizes that the Second Foundation is his only true nemesis as he quickly conquers the Foundation. The Mule follows the exploits of researchers as they seek and find the Second Foundation. How can the Second Foundation be discovered? Has the Second Foundation been discovered? Is Hari Seldon's plan truly out of control? The reader must move on to 'Second Foundation' to learn these answers and more!I enjoyed the second part of this book immensely. I had to read about the Mule until I learned whether he had truly destroyed Seldon's plan. Unfortunately I had to wait until the next book in the series to learn the truth but I was still on the edge of my seat.This book carries on nicely from 'Foundation.' If you liked that book you will enjoy seeing the challenges the Foundation faces as it tries to help create a future that remains hundreds of years away. This book is a worthy second book in the original Foundation Trilogy.The final book in the original Foundation Trilogy is 'Second Foundation.'Enjoy! ",4.0
" Not surprisingly this is a second reading - I first enjoyed this classic about twenty years ago.There's much to enjoy. Or rather there's the central idea to enjoy",4.0
" Foundation is an interesting technological/political science fiction. A very famous book obviously. The Galactic Empire has lasted 12000 years but it is predicted by Hari Seldon a genius scientist/psychologist/mathematician that the Empire will fall within 300 years. So he takes a large group of people to the distant planet of Terminius to create the Encyclopedia Galatica a book of knowledge. It won't save the Empire but at least will prevent the world from falling into chaos for too long. At least that's what I got from the purpose. The various parts of the book skip from generation to generation of people on Terminus and their various political problems.The political element of Foundation was very interesting to me. I hadn't read much political science fiction before. I don't think the world was that well developed; there wasn't a lot of description of it it was more focused on the various power-plays and intrigues going on. Also the way that each part is a different time period was a little off-putting; I really would have liked to know more about Gaal Dornick and some of the other characters. But you can't really narrate 300 years of history without skipping many years. At first I thought Gaal Dornick was going to be the protagonist. I was wrong.Anyway Foundation was an intriguing science fiction with an interesting plot and I'm certainly glad that I decided to read it. The cover says 'The Foundation Novels' so perhaps there are other books about this world too? If so I look forward to (possibly) reading them.All of my reviews can be read at my blog (novareviews.blogspot.com). ",4.0
" The second book in Isaac Asimov's Foundation trilogy. Bloated with administration and complacent with power The Foundation is now failing. Asimov's science fiction elements include a mathematical 'mob' theory that is able to predict the future of large populations. He calls it psychohistory. The math breaks down with individuals as they are too finicky and unpredictable. I loved the 'Mule' character. The ending is excellent and I can't wait to see how the trilogy concludes.Some of my highlights from the book",4.0
" If this series seems a little dated and naive now try to cut yourself back to when it was read! I appreciated the imaginative leaps as well as the way the whole series observes the discipline of the genre -- make one fundamental alteration to science as we know it and then see where the thread leads you.

" As the second book in the original three of the Foundation series Isaac Asimov picks up with the last efforts of the Empire to root out the Foundation. Those familiar with the first of the original three in this series will recognize the characteristics of the first book in this one immediately; a mixture of science and technology with a lot of wit and intriguing conversation. The second half of the book introduces the Mule a mutant that Hari Seldon's models could not account for. Anyone who enjoyed the original Foundation will surely enjoy this sequel.For those new to the series this should not be the first book you pick up. Based on order of publication the original series is best read in this order",4.0
" Set more than 10000 years in the future at the edge of a failing galactic empire this book isn't a story so much as a series of vignettes spanning decades. The book starts by detailing the effort to create the Foundation which will try to preserve civilization from total collapse as the Empire continues to decay. With each jump to the future we see the members of the Foundation confront a series of crises that threaten both the Foundation and the very fabric of civilization.Asimov has done a remarkable job of creating a believable far future with a human civilization that spans the massive space of the galaxy. His descriptions of the decline of the Empire and of the resulting chaos at its edges extrapolates nicely from history (particularly the decline of the Roman Empire). Though written half a century ago very little about this book feels particularly dated except possibly for the prevalence of characters that smoked. This book deserves its reputation as a science-fiction classic. ",4.0
" It's my third read of this book. First two I read about ten years ago when my English hasn't been that matured so after reading the book in original I immediately found a copy in my native language. Now I decided to read the whole saga and of course started from the very beginning.Just as addictive as before. And with fair certainty I can say that this is the saga that has inspired George Lucas or whoever he took his ideas from. And yet it all started with 'Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'... ",4.0
" This is the first book I read by the author Asimov. I know there are many more famous books from him like the Robots collections and Foundation. I picked this one for the first book simply because this is the first entry to the Foundation series on a chronological sense. I must say surprisingly this is a very easy-to-read (compare to Dune Lord of the Ring etc) but exciting and full-of-surprises book. At times it also gives us thoughful issues (e.g. can we 'predict' the future?) which is what we are anticipating from a sci-fi. I know from many many readers that Foundation is the best among all the volumes but I can imagine that this is already an enjoyable read I cannot imagine how exciting the Foundation book will be. It also thrills me to read all other series (Robot Empire etc) so as to get a full understanding of the history under Asimov's reign. I recommend this one to everyone who has never touch Asimov's work before. ",4.0
" It was a very interesting concept a bit heavy on a scientific version of 'fate'. This series of books uses the concept of random motion as a prediction for the future was quite a brilliant idea. The story deals with a genius who predicts behavior for millenia into the future and actually has recorded holograms for future people that deal with his predictions. Where I had trouble was the reliance on robots in the later books. I personally prefer the human side of things. It was an interesting read and well worth it. ",4.0
" Foundation is not easy to read since most of it is politics in the Foundation Universe. It follows the plot very closely but still keeps the scifi element with things like space travel and intergalactic empires.When I read it I found the religious aspect interesting. The main characters were either scholars politicians or interstellar traders and there were a lot of cloak & dagger type situations. Something I found interesting was that women didn't really play any roles until the last part of the book. It's kinda funny to see this Emerald City (Terminus) in the middle of these warring kingdoms who think they have the upper hand. The use of nuclear power as the ultimate source of energy is a important aspect in the book. If you like lots lots of action then this book isn't for you. ",4.0
" but just barely!Foundation (Foundation Novels)by Asimov; a classic a reread (its been at least 35 years however) and a very quick read. Sadly Foundation doesn't hold up well at all. It's hard to understand how such an accomplished mathematician and scientist like Asimov was so completely unaware of the coming ideas of chaos theory and how it would make his theory of 'psychohistory' so completely improbable and even faintly ridiculous. Secondly it's 12000 years into the future... and Asimov can't imagine beyond the common use of tobacco products blasters and nuclear power??All that said (and I know it's been said in many reviews in far less kind terms than I have)... it's still a fun story and one can see the roots and budding ideas of lots and lots of later authors. One can only wonder what science fiction will look like 70 years from now! ",4.0

" This book is a great scifi read but it is essentially a series of short stories. So you shouldn't expect a typical 'novel' story. They are set around the same theme of the Foundation a group set up by a man Hari Seldon who is brilliant at something called psychohistory. He predicts that the galactic Empire will fall and sets up the Foundation as way to prevent the knowledge of man from being lost. The first section details this storyline. later storylines are about the trials of the people of the Foundation. Hope you enjoy it! ",4.0
" continuing the lifetime Hugo award winning series written by Isaac Asimov...lest my snarkiness towards this venerable and respected author and his writing give anyone the wrong impression.. I am very much enjoying this reread! But the world (and I) have changed a LOT over the last 50-60 years (or in my case 40 years). Rereading the books that we loved when we were younger gives us insight into who and what we are today...Foundation and Empire (Foundation Novels)Isaac Asimov; continuing the 12000 years-in-the-future saga of cigar chompin' blaster-totin' space-faring men and women (yes the women also lovingly smoke cigars... much to the consternation of the men) as they attempt to unravel the mystery of The Mule and The Second Foundation.I cannot imagine anyone reading this series for the first time having any flicker of comprehension as to why it was so popular and how it garnered a lifetime Hugo award... but again.. kids these days have little appreciation for The Beatles and Elvis... so there you are.

" This book is one of the original science fiction novel of all time. I read this book as an outside reading assignment for my English class. First of all I chose this book out of all the other books because I didn't want to read something that sounds dull and unexciting. I wanted to read something more innovative and I certainly made the right choice when I picked this book from the library shelf.Hari Seldon the protagonist develops a area of study called psychohistory which allows psychohistorians to predict future events in big pictures. According to psychohistory the Empire will encounter decay in the future and an age of collapse will follow. This book portrays how our civilization tries to shorten the age of collapse by preserving all human knowledge.The book is divided into five section each with different settings. First section explains the psychohistory and sets up the stage. Second section takes place 50 years after the first and the new Empire starts encountering conflicts with resources. Third section starts 30 years later and it deals with religion. Fourth section takes place 55 years later and the new civilization gets involved in a trade conflict. Last section takes place 20 years later and involves merchandise matters. Each section has different characters. Each experiences different conflicts but they all pile up to show us how a civilization grows and how history is made.I liked how the writing is terse and straightforward. It is hard to follow the story because of the change of settings and many characters but they do come together. I liked how I could observe the history being made. It is fun seeing a civilization encounter conflicts digress from religion to economics and so on. It feels like I'm experiencing a century of history. It's easy to read because there isn't really any complicating science that you need to understand or in-depth character conflicts into the story. Definitely a book to read if you want to know how it feels like to be a god looking down at human civilizations and how they behave. Read it if you want to know what Hari Seldon's true plan is! ",4.0
" By the end of the thirteenth millennium mankind had populated millions of planets scattered throughout the galaxy. The centre of the imperial government was located on the planet Trantor in effect a single planetary city some 75000000 square miles in extent. Every conceivable square foot of habitable space was occupied with a teeming population well in excess of 40 billion souls. Its internal problems were so vast that it was all but inevitable that its grip on the outer reaches of its dominion should weaken. The empire like every other empire that had preceded it was in the throes of decline.Hari Seldon a brilliant mathematician and psychologist developed the science of psychohistory - the use of mathematics and symbolic logic to evaluate and predict the future behaviour of statistically large segments of human population. When he applied his analysis to the Empire the conclusions were bleak and inescapable. The stagnating Empire would imminently fall and collapse into a galactic dark age - a period of anarchy and chaos and a loss of art culture knowledge technology and science that would last for thirty thousand years.When he knew that imperial collapse was inevitable he created the 'Foundation' and implemented what was later to become known as the Seldon Plan. He couldn't stop the dark age but he could shorten its duration to a mere thousand years and give civilization the ability to start over again.Asimov known to his millions of fans merely as the 'good doctor' certainly didn't stint when it came to the scope of his ideas and the size of the canvas on which he chose to paint. 'Foundation' is a classic sci-fi novel that leans far towards the left side of the sci-fi spectrum. Hard sci-fi technology and advanced science are touched upon only to the extent that they are necessary to make sense of an Empire that spans an entire galaxy. Quaintly much of the science is seriously dated - data storage is on microfilm atomic power is the norm even in spaceships that are expected to travel galactic distances - and could hardly be considered brilliantly prescient.So it is clearly the ideas that Asimov deals with that have elevated 'Foundation' to its status as one of the most loved and most read science fiction novels of all time - science as religion the authoritarian nature of religious dogma the insidious Machiavellian nature of political diplomacy the inevitability of the decline and collapse of a major empire and a powerful discussion as to whether violence is a necessary tool to resolve differences or whether it is merely 'the last refuge of the incompetent'.While I will happily acknowledge that 'Foundation' was interesting and thoroughly enjoyable I was somewhat disappointed to discover that it did not have the same thrill or excitement that I experienced when I first read it thirty years ago. The level of science in the book seems almost lack-lustre and in my mind did not live up to the grandiose scope of the novel. Like so many of his peers in the 1950s women were stoutly ignored and played no part in 'Foundation' at all.Dickens wrote at the turn of the century so one expects his prose to be different. Asimov wrote 'Foundation' in 1951 so one certainly expects it to be a product of that time. But unlike Dickens (and I'm not really quite able to put my finger on the reason why) the prose simply didn't age quite as well. So in the full knowledge that many will disagree with me I'm unwilling to accord 'Foundation' the 5-star rating that many will expect. Four stars only from this reader and a high recommendation that this book must be read if you claim to be a fan of the classic sci-fi genre.Paul Weiss ",4.0
" My sister likes to randomly give me things based on conversations we had weeks prior that I barely remember. I must've been talking up Asimov (the man published enough articles/books for 10 lifetimes) because one day she gave me Foundation and asked me to read it. Not having read it herself she said the only thing she knew about it is that it's the book that established him. In reality the books initially a chapter-by-chapter series in a two-bit magazine never made him that much money until much later in his life. So it goes.You should therefore pick up this book knowing only that one piece of information; this book was his 'big break.' It starts engagingly enough",4.0
" I do not know much about science fiction. For this reason I read <Foundation> just as I read a fiction. Although so far I read only the first one of the trilogy I liked it.What is interesting and strange at the same time in this book is that in every chapter a new main character appears. It takes time for a reader to develop familiarity with a character and to get interested and affected by the character's thoughts and actions. By the time one forms such a tie with the character however the chapter somewhat abruptly ends and the character is finished! The chapters of this book therefore could be seen as self-contained short stories loosely connected by the theme of the development of the Foundation over one thousand years.One thing about this kind of way in which each chapter unfolds is that it may well have been inevitable for the author because he had to cover so long a time period. The other thing is that somehow it leaves a lot of room for a reader to think back more about what a character did in each crisis and how history set the stage for the crisis whether this effect was intended or not by the author.This book was a good read both entertaining and thought-provoking.

" I always enjoy reading Isaac Asimov's writing and foundation was no exception. The plot is imaginative and original like much of Asimov's writing. Foundation is set in the future a time when our galaxy is ruled by a failing empire. Hari seldon a psychologist must prevent the galaxy from falling into anarchy and barbarism by creating a foundation of scientists. Foundation is fun to read and provides ample entertainment. I recommend reading it. ",4.0
" This is the first book in the famous Foundation trilogy. The story is simple. It's over 50000 years in the future and humans have spread throughout the whole galaxy with millionsof worlds and quintillions of people united by an Empire. However the empire is crumbling.Enter Hari Seldon the pioneer of psycho-history - a kind of complete mathematical social science that uses statistical averages and modelling to predict social trends in large populations for thousands of years to come. Hari's studies show that the collapse of the empire is invevitable. However if he takes action now the period of suffering before the next empire might be decreased from 30000 years to 1000. So he establishes two foundations on opposite sides of the galaxy to follow his master plan. This book is the story of the first foundation.As a work of literature expect no marvels of prose or metaphor. Most of the chapters are dialogue between people. There is also little characterisation and a blatant disregard for the 'show don't tell' rule of writing. All of these things are there because the trilogy covers hundreds of years. As such this novel is divided into 5 books with a gap of decades or centuries between each. The whole text is very episodic as we watch an entire civilisation emerge from a modest group of scientists to a powerful force in the outskirts of the galaxy.So the concepts of the book were what I found interesting. Of course the whole premise that human history can be mathematically be mapped out as a kind of law of averages seems ridiculous to me. I don't think that Asimov believed that either - he just saw it as an interesting idea for a story. The great Hari Seldon maps out the future history of the Foundation ensuring that it basically has one cosmic path to follow - one which will end in laying the seeds for the new Galactic Empire.The first book details with around the first 200 years of the foundation as several crises are encountered by individuals as forces of history. With few military resources the leaders are forced to rely on their wit. I'm onto the second book now so should find out if that wit was enough.A great read in that you'll find in interesting even if you aren't a great science fiction fan - it has very unique perspectives social 'science' and what makes a civilization.

" I loved this show. The show has taken on a 'larger than life' persona over the years which I think is misplaced. You'd think it was 'I Love Lucy' 'All in the Family' or 'Mary Tyler Moore' with all the hype this show has received over the years. It isn't any of those things. It's simply a cute light comedy show that always makes you laugh and is hilariously silly all the time. It also works to show off the bodies of Suzanne Somers and even John Ritter. This first season really reminds you what the show really was simple cute episodes with a lot of laughs that doesn't take itself seriously as so many people today take this show as. The cast seems so young here but you get a feel for the show and see the real comic genius of all involved particularly Ritter. Though the price reflects this this is only six-epidode DVD. If you've seen other first season DVD's for other shows be aware that this is not a 20+ episode disc. It is six episodes that you will be able to watch within 2-3 hours as this show was a mid-season replacement so the first season was in fact only 6 episodes. There are no extras apart from a brief written summary of each show and a brief written tribute to Ritter.

" I am a big fan of the classic 'Three's Company' series. Therefore I would be hard pressed to say anything negative about the show. However this DVD is a teaser to die-hard fans by getting you started on an affordable collection yet limiting your viewing experience. With only six (6) episodes you find yourself quickly disappointed with the amount of content. Apparently the next DVD (Season 2) due out in May 2004 is more realistic in the amount of content and what a fan can more likely expect to pay for a full season's worth of episodes. Thumbs up to the actual content; thumbs down on the amount of content. ",4.0
" The season one 'Three's Company' DVD is something very special. It is a DVD that has the first six (6) episodes of a series that tickled my funny bone as early as the age of 5. I was especially proud to purchase this DVD today since the proceeds from it not only went towards a cause close to John Ritter's heart (a man whose work I've admired for many years) but one close to mine as well because John's brother Tom and I share that common ground. 'Three's Company' stars John Ritter as Jack Tripper; Joyce DeWitt as Janet Wood; Suzanne Somers as Chrissy Snow; Norman Fell as the 'uninterested' landlord Mr. Stanley Roper and Audra Lindley as Mrs. Helen Roper his 'sex-starved' wife.First I'd like to review the episodes. The pilot 'A Man About The House' was a good episode (surprisingly not my favorite of this season) although I liked it because it introduced not only the beginning of the series but a relationship with my favorite trio Jack Janet and Chrissy. There is also a scene in this episode at the beginning which had never been aired in the series' syndicated runs.The second episode 'And Mother Makes Four' was OK. I liked John Ritter's physical comedy in this episode although I do not want to give the plot away.The third episode 'Roper's Niece' is my favorite episode this season because of a 'touching' ending between Jack and Janet. The scene I'm referring to brought a tear to my eye. I don't want to give it away. Watch it and you'll know why.The fourth episode ''No Children No Dogs' was all right. It introduced Richard Kline as Jack's best friend Larry for the first time. I thought that was cool.The fifth episode 'Jack and The Giant Killer' was good and the sixth and last episode of the season 'It's Only Money' was OK.The best episode was 'Roper's Niece' but these six episodes are a great start to a wonderful sitcom. One of the DVD features had a paragraph written about the season two DVD (due out in early spring 2004) and the John Ritter tribute at the end was a written paragraph about how he and his brother helped raise money for United Cerebral Palsy with a UCP commercial narrated by actor John Mahoney ('Frasier's' Martin Crane). You'll love it. It's definitely a great taste of a wonderful series to come. ",4.0

I think this DVD is a good choice. I look forward to the Season Two episodes. ",4.0

There will be 174/6 DVDs ???? ",4.0
" I grew up watching this show I was 11 years old with several months to go before I turned 12 when Three's Company came on TV and I thought it was a cute show. Yes it was silly but sometimes I think we need a good dose of silly especially on a really stressful day and John Ritter really knew how to make people laugh he was very funny and so cute and he will be loved and missed by all his fans! The only complaint I have with this DVD is the sound is kind of low and I have to put the volume on the TV pretty high and then make sure I put it back down before I turn the DVD off as not to blast the eardrums of the next person who turns the television on but I'm pleased with everything else. The DVD is actually pretty cheap in price and is worth buying and the fact that they are donating money to a charity for Cerebral Palsy which John's brother has was one of the reasons I decided to buy the DVD the other being that I wanted to have the very first episode on DVD the one where the morning after Janet and Chrissy had the going away party for their old roomate Eleanor and they find Jack asleep in their bathtub.

" This is one of those 'it's about time' DVD releases. The first season of 'Three's Company' was a short one given only six episodes. But it was wonderful to see them in their original colorful vibrant presentations. The show stands the test of time and this is a must-own DVD for any classic TV fan.The only fault naturally is the lack of features and the small number of episodes. It might have worked better if they had combined this with season two and released a loaded collection next year. As it stands season two will be released next year and I fully expect a five-star collection. ",4.0

" With dialogue like that how can you NOT take to this movie. Crisp cool dialogue a minimal plot 100% action and performances from Halsey and Lambert taking the honours. The violence is bloodless though brutal (perhaps budgetary restraints prevented Mr Pyun from spending on blood squibs...reminded me of Miami Vice...gunplay but no blood). I'd love to see this one re-made with John woo directing. Bloodless violence aside (which takes the edge off the movie) the only thing that lets the DVD down is that the congenital cretins at Tri-Mark have seen fit in their infinite wisdom to present it as a Full Frame picture rather than the 2.35",4.0
" I tell ya nothing goes with fragging someone like mambo music. It used to be banjos but that turned out to be a flash in the pan and no one ever did capitalize on DELIVERANCE.

" Despite an obviously limited budget (no building-busting explosions cars plunging off freeways or helicopters flying through train-tunnels) and some lack of realism (not as bad as most action movies but noticable) this movie is a screen gem. Imagine a modern day version of 'It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World' with individuals and teams chasing after a cash prize of millions; only this time it's hidden inside a prison complex instead of underneath a pair of palm trees and the losers end up pushing up daisies. When the chase begins you'll find yourself picking favorites and rooting for them to win. The movie also borrows tastefully from 'The Good the Bad and the Ugly' and 'The Wild Bunch' with it's many showdowns and shootouts. The main characters are surprisingly well written and acted out (especially Marcus and Lou)in such a way so that you get a very good look into the personalities of each one without seeing a great deal of personal history on screen. And of course if you do watch it and wind up agreeing with none of this the least you'll have to admit is that the musical score rocks! The mambo music playing over the prison PA system was a wonderfully original touch. Check this movie out. The violence may not make it everyone's cup of tea (I personally loved it fast paced and gritty yet not bloody) but it has more than enough pluses to make up for it. ",4.0
" A group of thugs who betrayed a syndicate are put in a new prison with weapons and 10 million cash promised to the last 3 survivors. It centers on the various groups that form and partialy on various moral conflicts. It's obviously low budget direct to video but the action is entertaining and big action fans will see a few scenes intentionally taken from other movies (One scene has the table-roll-to-gunpoint from Hard-Boiled). The characters are certainly entertaining and have more then one dimension to them. My favorite was Christoper Lambert who insisted to Moon (the organizer) he be allowed entrance. Marcus was good and that actor had the best performance. The only bad thing about this was it's length",4.0

" This movie is a straight-to-video insane shoot'em up flick starring Christopher Lambert(in his best performance ever as the psychotic Lou) and Ice-T(Mr. Platinum Teeth). The plot is basically 100 criminals who have betrayed the crime organization known as the Syndicate are put in a prison and told that the 3 standing after 6 hrs will get 10 million dollars. Then the criminals are thrown guns and baseball bats to dispatch each other.....plot heavy eh? What makes this movie work well are the wonderful action sequences a great performance from Christopher Lambert as Lou a psychotic killing machine with the best lines in the flick and the actors who played Marcus and D both did well in their roles. Also the movie's 'soundtrack' is quite good....you'll see why if you watch the flick. The only weaknesses of this flick are really the annoying innocent lady who while she adds the human element of the flick is very annoying throughout the movie. Also the well-endowed femme fatale of the flick nick-named Barbie is somewhat annoying at points in the movie. Despite these flaws this film is a great action movie even though it went straight-to-video. ",4.0

" Don't expect this to answer all your questions. Don't expect it to be a collection of plans or blueprints.

If you are in some stage of planning building or modifying (or dreaming) and wonder what you may have forgotten this may be the book for you.It does not tell you specifically what to do. It does suggest ways to think through your work flow and place and power machinery.By way of example you may have not considered all your options for lighting the work area.

" This is a nicely photographed book that is loaded with features. It has several profiles of shops from people you've probably heard of (Sam Maloof James Krenov etc.) so if you've ever been curious about the shops of top woodworkers this is a good book. It has some basics about electrical and lighting layout but not nearly enough about machine placement and fitting the shop to your existing space. I wanted to optimize the use of space in my basement shop (with support pillars in the middle of the space) and didn't get much guidance. Given that most non-pros probably work in the garage or basement there should have been more dedicated to this kind of space.

" It is difficult to properly review this book. If one is used to the superb works usually presented by Taunton Press Setting Up Shop is a disappointment. Not because the information is inadequate; far from it! Sandor presents solutions to problems you wouldn't have thought existed until they jumped up and bit you on the nose. How much insulation should you have in your new shop? How do you keep the cords from wrapping around your legs and dropping you into the whirring tablesaw blade? Did you even know it could happen? It can. Sandor Nagyszalanczy will help you avoid disaster.Unfortunately I cannot give a full five stars to this book because it's layout is basically odd. References to other pages in the book are wrong and you have to hunt before and after to find the chart reference picture etc. you wanted.

It opens up with action and gives you just enough to make it a really good movie.One of the MANY reasons I love this movie is the hero. I watch a lot of kungfu and this type of storyline for mel is kungfu at it's finest. He really reminded me of a guy like Jimmy Wang Yu or even one of my favorites Chen Kwan Tai(baddie from crippled avengers). Mel plays the role just as good as any of them and maybe better.The commentary is also listenable and a pretty good making of. ",4.0
" Mad Max is a very imaginative wild and satisfying film. It's sequel The Road Warrior is a bit more thrilling but Mad Max delivers the goods. The film is set in the post apocolyptic Australia where savage biker gangs and outlaw drivers rule the roads. The film begins with policeman Max Rockantsky(Mel Gibson) who engages in a thrilling highway chase between him and a crazy driver called Nightrider. When Nightrider is killed in a firey crash his psychopathic friend Toecutter is enraged and wants revenge in blood Rockantsky blood. Toecutter and his vicious biker gang are known for terrorizing towns tying people to speeding motorcycles and much worse (as seen in the film). For a while in the film they stalk Max his wife Jessie and his infant son in very weird creepy scenes. Then when Toecutter and the gang run Jessie and her baby down on their motorbikes Max is beyond enraged thus becoming the title character Mad Max. The end of the film is a sensationalized thrillfest as Max dawns his leather road outfit two guns and hunts down the gang in his new Police Interceptor running some down shooting one and I won't mention what happens to Toecutter. Mad Max is very bizarre very brutal and very very entertaining. The stunts are quite impressive the villains are very well cast (particularly Toecutter and Johnny)and Mel Gibson is the ultimate Mad Max. The only snag",4.0

" 'Mad Max' the first film in a much-imitated but never equalled 'action' tragedy/trilogy perfectly sets up the following two movies. Together they form an epic of one man's losses of all he loves his ruthless revenge and his eventual redemption beginning in 'The Road Warrior' when he grudgingly assists a commune whose members repay him with treachery. Despite that his metamorphosis comes to fruition in 'Thunderdome' in which Max regains his humanity to the fullest degree.Side made several in Australia before this one and the one to see is 'Tim' in which Mel gives an incredible performance that's about as opposite of an apocalyptic anti-hero as anyone could get. This man has amazing talents to the 'Max.' ",4.0
" 'Mad Max' was made on a low budget ($50K to $100K according to various sources); the dubbing and some of the editing do make the film seem cheap at times but the photography and music are of big-budget quality.

" This is probably Mel Gibson's first film. A film he's done while he was in his 20's. There is no doubt that he would become a great star in his native Australia but this film launched him as an international movie star. Especially since they released Mad Max 2 which was universally released as 'The Road Warrior.' And 'The Road Warrior' is one of my Top Ten favorite films of the 1980's.Sure Mad Max has some of that cheesy seventies style but it definitely introduced us to a new kind of nameless hero which became the common theme of all upcoming action films even being made today.'Mad Max' is that one film being over 30 years old that can still be loved and cherished by people even less than 20 years old today.

" Mel Gibson first got noticed in America through the 3 'Mad Max' films although this original never came to the U.S. until after 'Mad Max 2' or 'Road Warrior' as it was known in the U. S. screened. While that movie was a cliched game changer the original has its charm as well. Produced on a non-existent budget this Australian film is set in a futuristic style of dust poverty lawlessness that we have now come to expect. The bad guys are just road marauders who exist to create havoc. The good guys are the cops (Mel) who are out to bring peace to the countryside. The movie is beautifully shot and directed especially given the money they clearly didn't have. There's no CGI here. All the stunts are real stunt men and the driving sequences are first rate. Sure there's not much of a plot but all hell breaks loose when Max comes back in the sequel. Stay tuned. ",4.0

Thankfully a friend picked it up for me overseas and what you will first notice is the superb picture quality!

In fact sometimes videos can be just as good qulaity as DVD's.Enjoy this film it will make you swirm smile and think for three days after!I think I am the only person who enjoys this more than the second movie (Mad Max 11 which is strangely titled 'Road Warrior' overseas!)

" When I first saw Mad Max in the cinema's 20 years ago as a younger guy I was so impressed by the raw-ness of the film.The DVD I have has heightend thisparticulaly in widescreen.Mel Gibson likened the character of Max to that of a card-board cut-out. I never looked at Mad Max like that. What i saw was a guy who was desperatly hanging onto the shreds of civility in a society that was becoming debased and uncivilised (one could liken it to living in Germany before the holocaust and coming out the other end) where security was insecure. Even Max wanted to quit Main Force Patrol because he likend himself to that of the gangs where it was becoming increasingly impossible to distinquish between that which was good or bad. After Jim Goose and Max's family have perished you see a side to him that many of us can relate to - vengence. When he confronts the murderers in the closing scenes it is not with joy that retribution is extracted but with a righteous anger against that which is evil. All in all Mad Max is the original. The Road Warrior and Beyond (eek !!) Thunderdoom become over-shadowed by the fact that Mad Max leaves them for dead in the smoke from His Interceptor. ",4.0
" This is a lower budget film. The thing that makes this film memorable is that it was the first (or one of the first) movies with this theme. the thing that also makes it so good is that becides having crazy people causing violence (that guys like) it also has emotions. The feelings of rage and retaliation are understood by people watching.Many movies have tried to copy this film but they failed. The main reason I think is because they focused on the violence part of it and forgot about writing thier films so people can agree with the feelings expressed by the main charictor.I think this movie is a low budget clasic.

" From all of the 3 movie it was the one that I'd rated as O.K. movie. This is supposed to be a beginning of the Mad Max. Where it all started. And I did watch it because I was interested in the movie trilogy. It wasn't too exciting to me and I've found the family of the Mad Max to be a boring thing. Just being honest. I predicted that something would happen to the Goose(a friend of Max) and his family. So maybe therefore. Also I know that it should have been in the movie as it was necessary to depict but I didn't like what savages did to women or men they've found. So to be short it was okay to see.

" 1 DVD Disc & 1 Blu-ray Disc released October 5 2010'Mad Max' was one of the first movies to come out of Australia that got huge attention around the world and began the career of a star Mel Gibson.

" A catalyst in the Contemporary Era revenge-actioner movement this George Miller flick features a young then-unknown Mel Gibson in only his second movie role as top-cop Max Rockatansky. After a pursuit of Max's ends in a fiery crash killing the pursued (a biker named Nightrider) he is targeted by motor-terrorists for the death of their fellow gang member. When Max goes on a vacation trip with his wife and their infant son they are attacked by the malicious vengeful mob leaving Max a childless widower hungry for his own violent revenge--and that's exactly what he gets. Set in post-apocalyptic Australia this film made for a meager $400000 held the highest cost-profit ratio of any film in Hollywood history until 1999 when Blair Witch surpassed its mark. ",4.0
" Would anyone have dubbed Alex from 'A Clockwork Orange' just because he used a bizarre otherwordly form of English? Or how about the childish drawl of Forrest Gump or Brando's slurred rasps in 'The Godfather?' Of course not! They were integral parts of the characters the settings and the times of those films. So why WHY were the distinctive wonderful accents and slang of the Australian characters in the U.S. version of 'Mad Max' dubbed over with apparently the voices of bland Midwestern newscasters? Did the film's U.S. distributors think they'd fool us? That American audiences would hear Matt Lauer's voice coming out of Mel Gibson as he raced across the deserts of the Australian outback and not think 'Hey! Those 'Americans' are driving on the wrong side of the road . . . and their steering wheels are on the wrong side too!?'Fortunately this DVD resurrects the outstanding original voices of the Australian actors and actresses coming through crisp and clear in stereo rather than the 'Hercules-in-New-York'-ish mono of the American dubbing.If you've seen 'Mad Max' before and hated it or even just thought it was so-so take a chance on this DVD and see it again in 'Australian-English.' It's an almost totally different movie. Believe me -- I didn't particularly like it the first time I saw the dubbed U.S. version either. If you loved it (pardon the cliche) see it again for the first time. You'll be transported into the surreal world of Australian outback biker slang that George Miller intended. And trust me -- Mel Gibson sounds a LOT better with his own voice than that of the mellow sedating NPR commentator (I can only suppose) they found to dub him. ",4.0
" When this movie came out it became the biggest Australian movie ever. It won awards all over the world and was given an 'X' rating for violence in France. Its American releasing company American International was concerned that American audiences would not understand the Australian accents and slang so they dubbed it with English voices. Then the company folded and in the fallout the movie wound up being released only as the bottom half of a double bill on 42nd st. in New York City. This dubbed version is what most Americans are familiar with and what is contained on this video.The story involves a highway cop in a world 'a few years from now...' where the roads have become dangerously violent. He worries that he is beginning to like the 'rat circus' that the highways have become and goes on a vacation with his wife and baby. When his baby is killed and his wife turned into a vegetable by a biker attack he puts his leathers back on and gets even becomming...Mad Max.On a symbolic level this movie can be seen as saying today's society is collapsing into a new dark age much like the Roman Empire. The cops have become as violent as the outlaws",4.0
" Y'know when I'm in the mood to watch a good post-apocalypse movie with lotsa high-speed cars & `cycles and plenty of collisions & explosions I just gotta turn to the original `Mad Max' to satiate my needs! And the new DVD presentation of `Mad Max' does just that! Not only do I get both the original Australian AND US-dub voice tracks I also get a better picture than what I used to see on my now-well-worn VHS tape of the flick! The picture isn't absolutely perfect though but this is more likely due to the quality of the original print than the quality of the transfer to DVD.Although I'm happy to finally be able to view and hear `Mad Max' in its original Australian dialogue I have a certain sense of nostalgia for the American dub as well as it gives the flick more of a weird Godzilla-like style & cheesiness to it! But if I had my `druthers I'd take the original voice track. Why you ask? Well there's just something not quite right about an American-accented voice-over uttering 'strewth!' you know? But never the less I have fun switching back and forth between the two tracks as I'm watching. I'm amazed by how well-synchronized they are-- I click from Aussie to Yankee & back and I miss narry a word of the dialogue! And yes people this IS my idea of a good time. Pretty sad huh?Anyway on to the special features. The commentary track contains the usual mix of anecdotes and behind-the-scenes memories that one has come to expect from movie commentary tracks. I was somewhat disappointed none of the four contributors was co-writer/director George Miller but I guess I'll just have to deal with it. Then there's the trivia feature which works somewhat like VH1's Pop-Up music video in that it comes on the screen every several seconds with a new factoid about the flick. Many of the trivia tidbits cover the make & model of the various cars trucks and motorcycles that appear here as well as letting the non-Aussie viewer in on some of the native lingo that's heard here. Also mentioned are some of the technical aspects of particular scenes as well as revealing where certain scenes were shot. Unfortunately I've read that some of the lingo & location trivia bits are incorrect. Which is something of a letdown but at least I've been given fair warning...Also included are a couple of documentaries which cover the making of `Mad Max' as well as taking a look at the early days of Mel Gibson's acting career. Like the commentary track there's plenty of amusing anecdotes and details about the more technical parts of the movie especially the great crash & collision stunts that one sees throughout the flick. One of the BTS doc's interviewees even refers to `Mad Max' as being 'porn for people who like fast cars' because of all the high-velocity vehicles and stunts! Now that's a most unusual analogy if ever I saw (or rather heard) one! Other neat momes include the fanboy who bought and restored Mad Max's MFP Interceptor and the prop that helped make the Toecutter's eye-popping demise so memorable!`Late! ",4.0

" In the dystopian world of the future as seen through MAD MAX the tough and crazy world we live in has become a lot rougher. Bandit gangs of motorcycle riders rule the roadways. They claim that anarchy and bedlam are the way to go. They steal cars run over people and rape women. The only thing stopping them from completely having their way is the Main Force Patrol (MFP) the last embodiment of law and order in the land. Driving vehicles full of swift and speed the MFP is the last line of defense in a world gone mad. The best member of the MFP is one Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) a cool officer with nerves of steel a heart of gold and a jewel of a sense of humor. Max succeeds in killing more thugs and bringing in more criminals than anyone else on the patrol. But even Max has his limits. After the death of a notorious criminal known as the Nightrider (Vincent Gil) his second-in-command takes over Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and vows revenge. First they kill Max's partner and then they come for Max but kill his family instead. That puts Max over the edge and he doesn't just get even he gets mad. At the end he drives away in his Interceptor and the legend of the Road Warrior begins.MAD MAX will always be known as the film that made Mel Gibson an international star. Until THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT it was also known as the motion picture with the highest cost-to-profit ration",4.0
" ...have to say that's so different? Well this film isn't the post-apocalyptic one that I was led to believe it is. Unless society is expected to have TV after a nuclear war the second and third ones are the post-nuke war installments. This film has a great start lonnng middle and a great end. The action portions of the film are the beginning and the end while the portions in the middle are more like melodrama. Big exception is that some 'Action' scenes are more like 'Horror' scenes especially the two kids being assaulted in their fire-paint car. The film does have a low-budget feel with some film cuts being repeated. The dubbing doesn't help though I thought I heard some Australian in the first chase scene [the crazy dude's chick riding in the passenger seat] and in the TV anchorman. Some of the music also seems over the top too. For all its faults it succeeds as a whole and worth watching if you like action films. ",4.0

" This is the first of the Mad Max trilogy and was widely touted as one of the early Australian films that came anywhere near contending with Hollywood at the box office. It is worth watching even in the concededly awful dubbed over version just to get the background to the later (and far superior) _Road Warrior_.In fact _Mad Max_ is so overshadowed by the second film in the series that it is sometimes difficult to see it as more than a prequel.This film does however stand by itself. The villains are actually far more sinister and psychotic than those in _The Road Warrior_ and the disintegration of society is more appalling. Here Max is still striving to uphold law and order but is pushed into vigilantism as a part of the same inexorable decay.The final scene/encounter is a classic and a great segue to the next film.Editing and continuity are just a bit off and the dub over is distracting. But see this before moving on to _The Road Warrior_. ",4.0
" Let's go back....wayway back.Back before the Jew-hating rantsthe philanderingthe ugly divorce and the numerous drunk driving charges.Back before the ugly ticking time bomb that star Mel Gibson has become now.Mad Max is Mel Gibson in his acting infancy and while it is very difficult at times to separate the actor and his career from the filmsseparate we must.Trained in the more traditional classical style of stage acting(Shakespeareetc)Gibson had debuted in films in just one role in /77 in Australia when he was offered the title role in Mad Max shortly after.Continuing working on the stage beforeduring and after shooting MaxGibsonlike everyone involved with the film including writer/director George Millerwere gobsmacked at the films impact.For just around a cool $1/2 million dollarsMillers' independent film company produced what would become an extremely profitable product way beyond their expectations.In fact it has pulled in to date over a $100000000! Gibson's career slowly lifted off the runway of mere acting mortals as he would go on to star in GallipoliThe Year of Living Dangerouslythe two sequels to Mad Max and then onto his Lethal Weapon series.And Gibson hasn't seen ground sincealthough some say his recent 'problems' have crash landed him unceremoniously back to terra firma permanently.We shall see.Mad Max's premise may be a simple one but it has a certain je nais sais quoithat draws you into the story and keeps you watching.Set in a future which is decidedly bleak('dystopian' being the word often used)the film opens with an escaping convict and cop-killer called Night Riderthat is being doggedly pursued by the constabularythis being the MFP(Main Force Patrol).Two MFP cars can't get the job done so it is up to their leather clad top pursuit man Max to get their man.And get him he does which ends with the convicts death in a fiery crash.The scene switches to a motorcycle gang which the now deceased Nightrider was a member of.The body of their former comrade is at a train station in a small townwhich they are there to collect.However a young couple watching some of the mayhem some of the gang members are unleashing decide to make a run for it in their car.The gang's boss man Toecutter(played delicously by Hugh Keays Burn)sees them and order all bodies to hunt them down.They easily overwhelm the couple and one member decides to stay behind and have some fun with the female of the two.He is caught later at the scene by Max and his partner Jimalias The Goose(Steve Bisley)and taken to be arraigned on charges.No sooner have they got their man than they have to let him go;no one turns out as a witness.The gang has a long memory and they eventually take out The Goose while he is trapped upside down in his vehicle as the result of a crash.Max is beside himself and he decides to retire.He turns in his resignation but his boss tells him to take some time off and then come back to reconsider.This he does with his wife and baby who go on an extended car trip around the countryside.While getting a tire fixed his wife goes to a nearby store to get some ice cream but its molested by none other than Toe Cutter and his gang.She barely escapes and they flee the area.They end up at a relatives farm but the gang has followed them there.While coming back from the beach through some woods Max's wife is being chased and he hears her screams.She manages to reach Max who whisks her into the house while he goes in search of the perps.However they have done a runaround and are waiting at the farmhouse.Wifey flees but her car has been tampered with and as she runs away from her broken down vehiclebaby in armsthe motorcycle gang run her down in the middle of the road.Arriving at the scene too late Max is filled with rage.He returns home with one thing on his mind;vengeance.He re-suits upgets an even more jacked-up pursuit car and heads out to get his pound of flesh.He dispatches the gang members first in a group then he goes after the two important ones;Toecutter and the guy who killed his partner;in that order.Toecutter gets his kissing the front grill of a semiwhile Max hand cuffs the other one to an overturned truckdripping petrol.He rigs a little something up set to explode in a short time and gives him a hack saw.He tells him he can either cut through the hand cuffs in about ten minutes or saw his handcuffed ankle offwhich should take about five(shades of 'Saw'!).The last shot of the movie is from the front hood of the car looking back at Max and the scene behind as he drives away.Of course the inevitable explosion occurs with the audience yelling an in-tandem'Yesss!'.But Max's face is not smiling;it's full of angstpain and the memories of the past 24 hours as he drives off to......who knows where? Fade out.As I mentioned before while this story may be simplistic at timesand while there are many moments that reveal its' low budget rootsthis a movie you just cannot stop watching.Just when other lesser films would fade into some irrelevant love scene or other paddingthis one has that hook that just won't let you walk away.You often wonder what is going to happen after such and such a moment and you may even KNOW what is going to happenbut it makes no difference.The film's rawness and punch always keeps itself on track.There are no apologies here and some of the more violent scenes are what they are because they BELONG there.This DVD set comes packaged with the Blue Ray disc also.The Blue Ray is a single sided disc while the DVD version is a dreaded two-sided double discand is on the bottom holder of the two.One side contains the filmin TWO versions",4.0

" Mad Max is a interesting little piece of movie history. While the script isn't all that compelling and the movie itself is obviously in the low budget arena Mad Max still stands out. Why? Because the movie for one doesn't try to be more than what it is. It's about fast moving vehicles and the heroes/villians who ride them. Move just a step above that and you get character development from both sides. Not much beyond that but again the movie doesn't pretend to have more.This is Mel Gibson's first starring movie role and he took the world by storm. This movie was a perfect vehicle to launch Mel's career. It gave him a chance to play the hansome hero with a full range of emotions (which he pulls off quite well). If it weren't for Gibson this movie wouldn't be anywhere near as good. Sure you get some good supporting actors but lets face it. This movie is about Max and Max has to carry the story.The supporting cast for Mel isn't just the actors but the vehicles as well. The police in this destopic future ride in fast interceptor cars. The bad guys are a nomad bike gang riding in various motor bikes. Max gets a really sweet car that becomes his trademark in not just this movie but the sequel as well. The cars definitely have character and the way they are filmed shows it. The chase scenes are fast and furious. No speeding up the cameras to make it look fast here. This is the sort of excitement the movie excels at.My only complaint is that Mad Max ends up just being a series of events that happen one after the other. The tie ins are sparse and the script is weak because of it. Then again this isn't Gone with the Wind. Still I have to at least mention it.This DVD is a must have for any MM fans. Not only do you get the American released english version but you also get the original Australian dub. Of the two the original comes out on top. Not because the 'American' dub is bad. It's actually pretty good in the sense that the voice actors did a good job of it. The problem is the American version was done in mono and you don't get nearly as much environmental sounds and background noises as you do in the original. Also the Aussie dub is in stereo which beats out mono anyday.The DVD also comes with a couple featurettes that really hit home for the fans. One is more about Gibson and one is more about the movie. Both are very informative documentaries. I think even longstanding fans of Mad Max would find some new info in these.To be honest Mad Max is not for everyone. If you demand blockbuster budget Hollywood style movies this isn't it. If you demand high art or deep stories you won't get it here either. However if you can get into a low budget movie that did one heck of a job in the car chasing department or are a fan of Mel Gibson then this is the movie for you. ",4.0
" 'Mad Max' (1979) is a remarkable sci-fi actioner starring Mel Gibson fresh from Sydney's National Institute of Dramatic Arts and directed by George Miller a film buff with film school training. Gibson plays Max Rockatansky a loner cop patrolling a post-apocalyptic Australia. The highways have become the arena for death games between nomad bikers and cops like Max along with his partner Goose (Steve Bisely). Enter the Nightrider (Vince Gil) a vicious biker escaping custody. He has just stolen a car from the Main Force Patrol (MFP) headquarters. A road chase between Max and the Nightrider results in the death of the latter. Unbeknownst to Max Nightrider's buddys come to town to seek revenge. They are headed by a demented lunatic named Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne). His followers are the mysterious Bubba Zanetti the drug-addled Johnny the Boy (Nightrider's replacement; not yet a full member) and psychopathic rapists/homosexuals Mudguts Cundalini Starbuck and Diabando. Whilst seeking vengeance upon Max they wreak much havok along the way. This includes an assault on a young couple and the slaying of Goose. A horrified Max quits the force and takes his wife Jessie (Joanne Samuel) and their baby Sprog on a much-needed vacation. Unfortunately Jessie is almost raped by the Toecutter and his gang but she doesn't tell Max what happened. Rather the Toecutter gang catches up with them and viciously murders Jessie and Sprog leaving Max with no choice but to embark on an explosive path of vengeance upon his tormentors. The biker gang is completely without empathy except for Johnny the Boy who became a full gang member only after reluctantly setting Goose on fire. The Toecutter is perhaps the creepiest nastiest villain to ever grace the screen while Bubba Zanetti epitomizes the ruthless killing-machine whose mission to destroy Max. The other bikers are no less sadistic than the Toecutter. The movie works mostly because of Gibson's performance as the damaged hero Max. It also features great effects and remarkable stunts and spawned an even more successful sequel The Road Warrior (1981). Overall a very good action film. Only quibble",4.0
" Mad Max is set in a world sometime in the future where society as we know it has crumbled close to barbaric proportions. Ruthless Biker gangs wreak havoc and mayhem with only a small scattering of pursuit special police to stand up against them. Mel Gibson (in his second feature film) plays Max Rockachansky a cop who wants to quit the road but is drawn back in when his family is slaughtered. Having grown up in the country of this movies origin I was always going to approach this particular title with some doubt. Mostly due to fact that the dialogue for Mad Max in Australia remains untouched unlike the US where it has been dubbed. But surprisingly enough I found myself drawn in mostly because the dubbed dialogue is the same as the original script with maybe some Australian terminology removed in a few spots plus changes and additions of new dialogue when the face or mouth of characters are not in the camera shot. So mouth flap is well accounted for but the dub occasionally stands out like a sore thumb. An example is when Jim Goose(Steve Bisley) is in the cafe at the start speaking with his mouth full. About 98% of the dialogue is still there which leads me to ask 'Why did they dub it?'. And more importantly 'Why have they not released a DVD version with the original actors voices given the success of one particular actor?'. In any event the movie dubbed or otherwise is still a top actioner. I give a full five stars to the original version. ",4.0
" George Miller launched Mel Gibson's career in this low-budget film about a solo cop who's out for justice after his partner and family are killed by ruffians. Although the film doens't have the explicit apocalyptic theme and plot of its sequel this film has plenty of high-speed chases and tension to keep the audience entertained.Mad Max (Gibson) is one of a few cops in a small town being ravaged by a motorcyle gang. After several tragedies Mad Max is left alone is swears to exact vengeance on the gang of outlaws.Again the film isn't too clear about its setting",4.0

" I like the _Mad Max_ series but I think the two sequels are better movies than this one.It's not that it's _bad_. It's just that it consists mostly of an hour and a half of atmosphere. Another film would have had this entire plot take place in the first half-hour and gone on from there.The idea -- a postapocalyptic mood piece set in the Australian Outback -- is wonderful and naturally enough the scenery is gorgeous. And considering the shoestring the movie must have been made on it's very good. It's just not much fun to watch twice because it takes so bleedin' long for anything to _happen_.The best thing about it is the young Mel Gibson who perfected the likeable-handsome-lug persona a generation ahead of George Clooney and who plays Max with just the right combination of rogueish charm and leonine ferocity. When he finally _does_ go 'mad' his puckish humor evaporates and he burns like a slow and deadly fire.The rest of the cast does well too -- and having previously owned this film on VHS I'm glad that the DVD special edition includes the original voices. The thick Strine may be a little hard for U.S. audiences to follow at first but once you pick up the wavelength you won't have any trouble. (Besides the old U.S. dubbed version is available as an option.)Anyway as a longtime SF geek and an avid devourer of postapocalytpic films and novels I really like the atmosphere and the concept of this movie. I just have a hard time watching it too many times close together. For that I prefer the two sequels.But this one is still worth watching and owning for the story it tells -- the mythical tale of the birth of one of modern cinematography's great heroes/antiheroes.

" i agree with the sentiment that an australian version is necessary. that's why its down a notch from five. that would be like dubbing lock stock and two smoking barrels. anyway onto the film...some may call it a standard action/revenge movie but i would say it has some elements that elevate it from the norm. its a very bizarre and disturbing film which to me is a strong point. most characters driven by revenge usually end up sad they brood then just set out for revenge. But here max is truly broken insane not in a wild sense but almost emotionless. he has completely snapped and deserves the title of Mad Max. and to those who haven't seen it SPOILERS AHEAD if you don't want to know...just had to throw it in there...the fact that only his child his killed his wife is still in critical condition when he breaks off into revenge adds to it. all the more unsettling that way. you have to love DVDs for their tendency toward widescreen. it adds to the experiance. the image is crystal clear and if only they could throw on the original dialogue track...i'd have a definitave version.

" Anyone intelligent enough to 'get' this movie is capable of understanding the Austrailian version. We have moved beyond the need for Americanizing films which tend to water-down the original intent and flavor of the director/creators vision. This movie for me is more relevent today than it was when it was filmed. In this part of America especially in small town rural areas you can almost get the feeling that we are living in this future. Many people in the midwest scrounge and save their meager earnings to be able to afford to fill their gas tanks just so they can drive to their jobsite. The desolation of the area in which the movie was filmed makes this movie eerily believable and I often am reminded of the look and feel of the film when driving through some small midwest American 'ghost-towns'. In spite of the realism this motion picture is still high escapism which for me is the point of watching movies. I'll watch this one over and over. ",4.0

" 'Mad Max' is a pretty simple revenge tale a rousing sci-fi biker and car-crash-a-thon. Mel Gibson plays Max a police pursuit driver in an unspecified future where roadgangs terrorize the innocent. Evidently road rage is way out of hand! When motorcycle thugs kill Max's best friend Goose (amiable Steve Bisley) his wife (Joanne Samuel) and son Sprog (!) Max gets mad... and gets even. What elevates this drive-in flick to cult classic status is director George Miller's use of low-riding wide-angled shots to give the chase scenes an intensity never before seen. And Mel's presence too I suppose. Mel looks awful young but flashes the charm and charisma that keeps him atop the box office charts all these years later.Like all cult movies 'Mad Max' has its cheesy moments. Max's scenes with his wife feature some goofy dialogue and there's a very cheap-looking nightclub set at one point. But Hugh Keays-Byrne as the reprehensible Toecutter and Tim Burns (an Adam Ant lookalike) as the psychotic Johnny provide ample menace. Plus Miller and company throw in some very unusual-looking supporting players. And then there are the spectacular stunts and kinetic camerawork; they've been ripped-off a thousand times since!This 'Special Edition' features a crisp widescreen print (ooh!) and even better the original Australian vocal track (ahh!). Finally someone wised up and banished the cartoon voices. The original actors perform solidly throughout even subtly in places. At last you can see why Samuel Z. Arkoff would bother to import this movie. But why'd he mangle it with bad overdubbing? No matter. The sequel ('Road Warrior') remains the superior film but this new-to-the-U.S. version of the first movie provides some adrenaline-inducing adventure. Includes some nice commentary with plenty of inside trivia on the stuntwork and how they risked their lives just filming it! Truly death-defying work.

" I saw 'Mad Max' almost a decade ago on local TV and despite being edited for television it was a shocking and intense movie. Besides the simple plot this film manages to work just as well as when I first saw it. The violence is this film is rather tame often cutting away to show something that may be not as gory but is just as shocking. The chases in this film are incredible (and the more surprising since this was made before the advent of CGI). The new DVD release has some rather interesting treats such as the original Australian audio as opposed to the dubbed version that floats around on television (the fact there doesn't seem to be a problem with understanding the dialogue in the original track makes me wonder why it hasn't been released like this in the U.S. for so long) plus you can pick between seeing the film in Widescreen or Pan&Scan (widescreen...no contest on how I watch it) a documentary on the film's influence and a commentary by members of the crew (who explain some of the more startling sequences in the movie). For the price 'Mad Max' is definitely worth checking out. ",4.0
" It is a great movie. Just about the best of it's kind ever mind. Has bravura performances (yeah Gibson's great acting in it but how about some kudos for the nice looking chick playing his wife in this movie----Joanne Samuel) believable futuristic sets plenty of action magnificent score memorable dialogue. It tries hard to be more than just a movie and it suceeds admirably. But now two problems with this honestly magnificent film (maybe minor problems---maybe!). One. The film looks it's made mostly for 15 year olds. I swear. It'a alot of action and emotion (too much at times) and some more story woulda really been nice in parts. Learning more about say Max and Jesse's marriage. Also how civilization fell. Two. The story itelf is uneven. After the gangmember The Knight Rider is killed while Max (Gibson) is pursuing he (Max) is told the man's gang is out to get him. Ok. So when Max later meets up with all of them hoods it's because the gang is after him for killing the Knight Rider right? Wrong! It's Max that is after them for incidentally (to the KnightRider's cause) killing Max's child and wife both of whom the gang coincidentally met up with while the family of Max (and Max too) were faraway on a vacation! What happened to the gang's original plan to get Max for killing their leader? And talk about your chance meetings and it's a small world after all. These and other uneven bits (some concerning characters like a hood called Johnny the boy) abound. Like I said story is uneven. ",4.0
" 'Mad Max' is an advertisement for all would-be directors to just take up the 16mm device and damn well shoot. Although the present era is less friendly towards this move just look at how a crock of dung like 'The Blair Witch Project' managed to make it to the cinema. This first installment in the Max trilogy finds a very young Gibson beginning with perfunctory zest but soon becoming beset with rage at the loss of his friends and family. While the acting is above-board all right the real stars of the show are the automotives themselves. With the Pursuit Interceptors running as thinly-veiled Datsun heaps who could have thought that so much hps could have been squeezed out of every car in this picture? Extra kudos go to Toecutter's gang. If you look very carefully at the bit where Max fresh out of the hospital where's he learnt that his wife is in critical and his son dead charges the bikers on the overcross bridge you will see that the biker with the red helmet gets his neck broken by the distended front wheel of his or a comrade's cycle! Ouch. I wonder if he died in real life. There's so much in here that is amateur pulling through as professional-looking who knows how Miller was able to direct it. At any rate the choreographer must have been ripping hairs. The movie itself is just the right length and the ending is bleak and suggestive for a sequel. The post-apocalyptic vein was handled in a novel way showing how present-day elements could co-exist with the Beginnings of the End. All in all to sum this up in three words",4.0

" For more than 20 years American audiences were saddled with an inferior version of the 1979 action-thriller from Down Under. A worldwide hit upon its initial release director George Miller's 'Mad Max' had the misfortune of receiving U.S. distribution from American-International Pictures (AIP) which trimmed five minutes and redubbed the film with American voices - thus eliminating its Australian flavor. Adding insult to injury AIP buried the movie in drive-ins and grindhouses as a second feature. Happily the original 95-minute version can be found on this DVD release. Fueled by Mel Gibson's effective performance as a vengeful highway cop and David Eggby's stunning photography the futuristic 'Mad Max' boasts some extraordinary stunt work and offbeat characterizations. Miller gains tremendous mileage from his limited budget and the Australian locations provide an ideal visual counterpart to the desolate cops-vs.-bikers atmosphere. Not surprisingly this independent cult classic helped put Australia on the cinematic map. ",4.0
" In spite of the fact that the 1981 film The Road Warrior--the second influential cinematic work of writer/director George Miller's Dystopian vision of the near future trilogy--leads to receive the anti-hero Max released two years earlier is where it all started... For it was here that Miller first brought to the screen his hellish vision where civil society is under siege by crime and disorder with the strength and charisma of a new young tough good looking actor by the name of Mel Gibson...Gibson was just 23 years old when he took the role of Max Rockatansky--a young hotshot cop so emotionally wounded--and was such an unknown star that when the film was hitting the screens in the States the preview trailers didn't even mentioned him but instead focused on the movie's coolest and most original car action ever filmed... In retrospect of course Gibson's portrayal of a relentless vigilante is an essential element of the picture...In the Australian outback Rockatansky is a motorcycle cop trying to keep order in a quickly disintegrating society... Vicious lawless bikers and road-raging psychopaths race up and down the forbidden territories raping and pillaging the peaceful towns and one such bunch ends up at the door of Max's wife (Joanne Samuel) and their 2-year old son... When they are both lying dead in middle of the road Max is all driven over the edge and so starts a high-speed pursuit involving wild rides chilling fights and memorable fast-motion suspenseful scenes rarely equaled in cinema...

" ... and I don't just mean the Mad Max saga but the Mel Gibson story. I'd heard this movie got Mel Gibson noticed among the big players - seeing it today made me believe it.The movie begins with a car chase with some really gutsy destruction sequences somewhere amongst which Gibson makes his entry as an 'Interceptor' a cop from the near future - where this story is based - trying to make order in this 'Anarchie' (no kidding! that's the name of the Ln mentioned in the first few shots of the film!). The government is pretty much non-existent in this futuristic flick and gangs of roadies have taken up terrorizing and literally ruling the outlands.Max along with his partner - Office Jim Goose takes his work seriously and intends to clean the scrounge of the town before his partner becomes a casualty of the war. Max suddeny is afraid for his family and realizes he's not ready to take this war to its bitter end and decides to take a break from his cop-career.What follows is an eerie rendition out on the Australian outback of the origins of the character of Mad Max before it got the adjective Mad; with some really slick editing and heart-pumping action. The chase sequences are simply great and the lack of dialogues makes it that much more watchable. Not much to speak - if you're into killing amd ambushing for a living.This movie is the first of the trilogy of Mad Max and is a good one at that. You get to see where Gibson learnt the conviction and grittyness that has since marked so many of his roles notably Lethal Weapon Conspiracy Theory and The Patriot.Must see - for Gibson and Mad Max fans!

" At this point Mad Max is simply a post apocalyptic classic film. While some people may not enjoy the movie through and through I don't think that statement is very much contested. Don't get me wrong it's a fairly old film from today's perspective and its filming style shows that. I think in perspective this movie was pretty on point for what people were thinking about at that time. I mean when you think about it the Cold War was still going strong and each country was trying to out power the other in terms of military might. So the greatest concern at that time was a nuclear war and 'Mad Max's' setting takes place shortly after such a catastrophic event.It's pretty interesting to watch because it gives a pretty interesting 'what if' scenario if technology and development stopped in the late 1970's. So you never had the internet boom and the age of the computer in the 90's. It's kind of cool when you try to picture this scenario. The places it's most apparently are in the hospital and the kinds of cars they are using. Despite this downfall it seems like everyone has custom vehicles and most are designed with a sports car in mind. In the hospital scenes it reminds me of the film version of 'Johnny Got His Gun' because the hospital areas just seemed too archaic by today's standards.In Mad Max the world is still trying to hold on to the small vestiges of society that it can. Lawlessness is at a whole new level and it seems that the court systems run amok similar to our current ones. Basically the main premise for the film is that Mel Gibson plays a cop named Max who is effectively terrorized by a biker gang indirectly at first but then very directly as the movie moves on. The gang has this bizarre spiritually violent ethos where the main member Nightrider was a key messenger of this philosophy... or at least that's how I'm interpreting his role. The police sort of have a hand in this man's death so another member of the gang Toecutter comes after them. Nightrider's death is what sparks the turmoil and brings the gang into town to wreak their havoc.It's really kind of a tragic tale when you think of it as a whole but that's kind of the point. Max is a tragic character that gets pushed to the absolute extreme on every end. However I think during this film they didn't truly know what direction they wanted to bring Mel's character and I feel that direction was finally found in 'The Road Warrior.' However 'Mad Max' is still fairly essential in order to get into Max's background and why he is so angry. There is a slight discontinuity between the two films though because at the end of this one he still has contact with some semblance of civilization and in 'Road Warrior' it's all wastelands.While 'Mad Max' can seem a bit dry at times because it's mostly cars racing around on highways it does set the stage for a very influential film (I feel at least) in the future. While authors were setting the stage for post apocalyptic worlds 'Mad Max' set the stage for a lawless and harsh reality unlike '1984' where the war pushed society to much stricter controls. I think this is the type of movie people should at least see once at the very least for nostalgic purposes because it does not have nearly the same re-watch value as the sequel. ",4.0

Robert Pastorelli (the crazed painter from Murphy Brown) plays a rather lackluster role. Kathleen Turner pulled off the typical 'Evil Witch' role a little too well. Mara Wilson seemed to do a better job in 'Matilda' but she was good in this film nontheless.I happened to get the Italian version of this film (alternately titled 'Un Semplice Desiderio') and I will add that watching this movie with Italian audio on adds a little to it. Granted I may have never even seen this film if it werent in a lot of videos I bought from ebay.it ",4.0

" This disc contains some extremely rare and valuable recordings of Crowley himself. For those interested in his rituals this disc will help to learn the intonations and pronounciations he uses in his invocations/rituals (including his pronounciation of Enochian--the first and second Aethers (keys) are recorded both in English and in the original Enochian itself.Some of the disc consists of his poems (interesting but not relevant to the student or researcher interested in his metaphysical work) and there's even a recording of him singing!Those who have read Crowley extensively will be suprised at his voice he doesn't sound as one would expect him to. But once he is actually intoning a chant the 'voice' that you would expect appears to come out.Overall a bit crackly (not unusual considering the very old sources) but well (if a bit unevenly) digitally enhanced inconsistent (mixing magickal ritual with poetry--as of course did the Equinox) and--to the individual with a serious interest in Crowley indespensible.I rated it 4 stars for value to the collector or practictioner and would rate it 2 stars for quality and consistancy.

" This thin book explain modern finance methods in a concise way and is useful for both financial and real investment applications. The book is divided into four chapters with lots of exercises at the ending of each chapter. In contrast with most other texts this one frequently uses Laplace transformations to solve the differential equations (used also in Cox & Miller 1965 a book about stochastic processes).The first chapter is an overview of stochastic processes (arithmetic and geometric Brownian mean-reversion jump process) stochastic tools (Ito Lemma) and correlations between two stochastic process (see the table at p.16 for a summary of multiplication for differential variables).In the second chapter the frequently occurring differential equations is presented which has the same general format in financial derivatives problems and also important questions such as the homogeneity of these equations the discount rate for the assets (showing that the solution is of the same form in risk-averse and risk-neutral economies) and an introduction of recursive techniques in asset valuation is also presented.The third chapter explain the arbitrage principle with applications for asset valuation. European and American options are analysed and the 'smooth pasting' (or 'high contact') optimal condition is presented for the American one.The last chapter deals with optimal as a maximation of present values first with the time-homogeneous problem (a infinitely lived asset or project) followed by extensions",4.0

" I've long thought that when the day comes (hopefully not for a long time) when it's time to write Barbra Streisand's obituary that someone will lead off with something along the lines of 'In 1964's 'Funny Girl' Streisand dazzled Broadway in her first starring role proclaiming 'I'm the Greatest Star' and for next 40 years she was.'She's been that good. And she's maintained her allure her mystique and the persona that was somehow above it all throughout. Her movies -- on average just every other year or so in her heyday -- weren't just films...they were events. Her records from each decade showed her willingness to expand her repertoire and somehow against the odds stay current in a business where most artists have a short shelf life. Her television appearances and specials -- all too few of them -- also added to the legend. She doled it out sparingly as if she knew that she'd maintain her value as an artist if she picked and chose carefully. And her live appearances were the real holy grails...after 1969 you really had to be on a special list as she came out only for 'causes' during the 1970s and 1980s.And when she chose to come back to the concert stage first in 1994 then in 2000 and now in 2006 her fans rushed right back to worship at the altar of the performer who'd offered up so few glimpses of herself in the two and a half decades prior. And with good cause they came. She's delivered the goods in each and every concert she's put together. The playlists have been varied (after you factor out the songs that she simply cannot ignore when she's out there). And it has been something to behold each time. (I saw her in 1994 and 2000.)It's been interesting reading the reviews on line at Amazon. Some people insist she's every bit as powerful as a vocalist as she was 40 years ago. Others acknowledge that time has taken its toll on that singular voice. In this concert more than ever the effects of 64 years on the planet can be felt no doubt. The upper register where she once dallied with thrilling ease isn't what it used to be. Listen to 'Starting Here Starting Now' and compare it to older versions. It's all right there. Even 'People' with its upper notes on 'are the luckiest people in the world' just ain't what it used to be.But one can't care about that. We can no more expect our artists to stay the same anymore than we've stayed the same. Many people write 'I've been a fan for 20-30-40 years' so we know they've gotten older along the way too! And I wonder if the people who take issue with what she can't do anymore might just be projecting onto Barbra their own fears about what they can no longer do either. Just a thought...The ironic part is that Barbra's voice is still marvelous; it's just different. It's not necessarily that voice you remember. It's perhaps suited to other kinds of material -- jazz especially comes to mind in a stripped down spare setting. Of course as long as she's going to perform in huge venues for 20000 people...they're going to expect to hear her come out with the biggies from her catalogue and to reach for those amazing notes in those one-of-a-kind arrangements and an intimate jazz evening simply wouldn't do. And then when she does the stuff from her catalogue she invites the inevitable comparisons to the Barbra of yesterday. And strictly speaking they're not going to be positive. But again is that the point? That she come out sounding like a 32-year-old woman? Would we compare a golfer in his 60s with Tiger Woods...or even with himself from 30 years ago. Of course not.Her voice is imbued with all of the living she's done. Like every great singer who kept on (Rosemary Clooney comes to mind) it becomes more about their respect for the material their ability to draw nuance from the music and the lyrics -- the sum total of their personal path as a human being and as an artist.So celebrate Barbra. Be happy that she's still out there connecting with people through her music and through her story-telling. We'll not see the likes of her again and while she's still around let's enjoy what she has to offer. It's still bountiful. ",4.0

" As I write this I'm listening to my newly purchased 2-disc 'Live in Concert 2006' and I'm reminded once again that Barbra's is the premiere pop voice of the last almost fifty years. At age 65 she reminds us (as if we her fans need any reminder) that so much of what passes for music nowadays is simply unacceptable and mediocre...but that Barbra forty-five to fifty years after she first burst onto the scene is still a force of nature an incomparable artist almost without peer...no make that 'without peer.' For all of you youngsters rating this album let me offer that I saw Barbra live in Soldier Field in Chicago back in 1967...one of her stops on her Million Dollar Baby Tour. All of these years later as I listen to her in concert on this latest double CD I can honestly say her voice doesn't do what it did forty years ago. The voice is much more mature sometimes husky sometimes showing slight strain...but it's a voice that has managed to remain near perfect enough to raise the hairs on the back of my neck as she reprises songs from albums years ago...I'm amazed at the frequent moments she sounds just asfine now as she did then. This is a live performance to treasure! ",4.0
" Her lower register has developed a burnished throatiness and some of her more precocious high notes escape her now. However the lustrous glow of her voice is still very much in evidence and the melisma and dramatic conviction remain unparalleled. In her mid-sixties Barbra Streisand is a willful force of nature a multi-media conglomerate based on a most singular persona and easily the most accomplished song stylist of her generation. As expected her Fall 2006 tour was as much a commemoration of her nearly half-century career as it was a cause celebre for her renowned liberal causes via her foundation. I was fortunate to have seen her in San Jose in mid-November and even if this was recorded earlier in her tour in New York Washington D.C. and Ft. Lauderdale this two-disc set represents a wonderful remembrance of that evening as well as a pristine document of a beautifully turned performance for those who missed it.First things first the concert is not the therapeutic exercise in self-introspection like Streisand's two previous comebacks (1994'sBarbra",4.0
" This is a good double CD packed with alot of favorites. I liked slot of her 'dialouges' between songs (her words & messages are invaluble & timeless).

" I love Barbra and her music. I went to see her concert last year so I bought this CD set to remind of that moment. While all her albums are a joy to listen to I found this one to be more of the same. Some of her concert albums from the 1990s are better and more powerful. Her voice is not quite as strong she does not hold those notes quite as long. Didn't care much for her backup band Il Divo. Nevertheless the album is a delight. ",4.0
" So what if her voice shows some wear and tear? She still sings better and sounds better than most singers. I'm not a rabid fan and I was disappointed in some of her studio work of late but I wasnt disappointed in this live set. In some ways I enjoyed it more than the last one. She does sound a bit raspy here and there but considering her age one cant expect her to sound like she did 40 years ago. I could've done without Il Divo and some songs she has sung to death like Evergreen but she does sing a lot of new material (new in the sense she hasnt done them live in quite awhile) I was a little disappointed there was no On A Clear Day (though it was in the overture so maybe she did sing it at some point) but overall I'm happy to have this recording which may be her last for some time. I think you will too. A lot cheaper than springing for tickets (Which I didnt do! Too poor). ",4.0
" To me Streisand is one of the great wonders of my time. She certainly has entertained me as a singer and actress not to mention her multi-talented skill set that has enabled her to be all she can be. I found Live In Concert 2006 another good listening album. Still has a fine voice but I didn't care for the conversations with the audience as I have in the past. ",4.0
" Barbra Steisand continues to amaze me with her fantastic voice. Her live concerts with audience reaction and her interaction with the audience makes for a wonderful CD filled with many of her hit songs. Adding IL DIVO to the CD really makes it special. Barbra's voice remains clear and strong with perfect enunciation as she sings my favorites 'Somewhere' 'Happy Days are Here Again' 'Don't Rain On My Parade' 'What Are You Doing the Rest of My Life' and on and on. I rated this CD a four star instead of five star because I liked her 1990's concert tour CD better rating it a five star performance with more of her classic songs. The orchestras who accompanied Barbra on both tours were fantastic. I would highly recommend both the 1990's tour CD and the 2006 tour CD to every Streisand fan. ",4.0
" I've had this tent over a year and used it enough to let you know that for this price there's probably not a better tent out there unless you need something designed for cold weather. I've camped out in this tent down to about 38 degrees with a decent sleeping bag and felt no ill effects.The tent is a pretty basic dome tent that takes about 15 minutes to get up using the included poles and stakes. A nice feature on this tent is the two 'legs' that extend from the basic dome. They have easy access from the outside and they're great for storing gear that would otherwise take up valuable floor space.The tent is made from a lightweight nylon with a heavier tub style bottom to keep the moisture out. The tent itself has open windows/vents on top but when covered with the supplied fly it does feel like an enclosed tent. I've camped in this through a night of rain and we remained dry inside with our gear. The zippers on the doors and windows worked normally without any complaints and did there job as well.While this tent is listed as being able to sleep 4 people it would be a very tight squeeze. I fit a queen size air mattress in it with not much room to spare except for the 'legs'. To me this is more of a 2 or maybe 3 person tent but I think you would be hard pressed to fit 4 people in.The tent comes with all the necessary poles and stakes and stores in the included storage bag. The assembly instructions are actually sewn onto the storage bag so there always there if you need them.I would have given this tent 5 stars but it shouldn't be listed as a 4 person tent. However for a 2/3 person tent that isn't going to be used for extreme conditions this tent is a great buy. ",4.0

" On her first solo album I COM Miss Kittin crushes the 'electroclash' pigeonhole that's followed many of her collaborations. Instead on 'Professional Distortion' she gets rock-hard on your ass all brutal and rough and 'Meet Sue Be She' happily continues that vein. Even 'Requiem for a Hit' starts off with some aggressive if funky misogyny but Miss Kittin quickly reclaims feminine power as her own. She also shows surprising range from the click-house leanings of 'Allergic' to the tender ballad to hermaphroditism '3eme Sexe.' There are moments where Miss Kittin seems to have bitten off more than she could comfortably chew but this album certainly goes down smooth. ",4.0

My favorite song is '1982' which was done with the Hacker on a different CD.The only thing I really have to say about this CD is that 'Requiem for a Hit' is one of the better songs on the CD. I don't know maybe I'm just haven't been in the mood for this type of music as of late and that's why I can't get into the CD at all.

" I first heard Miss Kittin (or Caroline Herve) on Felix Da Housecat's album `Kittenz and Thee Glitz' where her deadpan vocals dominated `Silver Screen Shower Scene' the best song on that album. She is also from that same electroclash scene as Chicks on Speed and Tiga.`I Com' is her second album and is more club-friendly then her previous outing. The beats are more in your face and her sense of irony is stronger with track 2 `Requiem for a Hit' in particular standing out. First half of the album is excellent it does takes some more listens to get into the second half. Another good reason for owning this album is the inclusion of the video for `Professional Distortion'. An album for the suicidegirls.com generation. ",4.0
" Miss Kitten is a busybody from France. She is a DJ and singer. She did a record with The Hacker which was one of the first Electroclash records. Everyone knows that song 'Frank Sinatra.' This her first solo record that also has a lot of people showing up here. Miss Kitten does a lot of talking over these songs in her deadpan style. She is not repeating the now cliches of Electroclash. 'Requiem For A Hit' goes from fast rock to R&B. The changes in speed are very unique. She covers a lot of styles like punk rock in 'Meet Sue Be She' minimal techno in 'Soundtrack Of Now' and more ambient sounds. This is a must have for electronic music in 2004. Miss Kitten is a cool French chick that wishes she was from Berlin. ",4.0

He then uses two case studies that show the relationships in the real world.I really appriciated the second case study showing the opening days of WWII in Norway. The case study told the story of COL Erickson who took the initiative to sink a German Cruiser amid the cowardice of the politicians and the inadequate preparations to maintain Norway's neutrality; a story I never read before this book. I would recommend reading the second case study before the first case study discussing the GEN Haig in the First World War.

" There are much better Falco 'hits' collections to be had but the reason to seek out this CD is for the 3 extremely rare bonus tracks. The Salieri remix of 'Rock Me Amadeus' is the version most Americans will recognize. This is the 8+ minute version that was included on the now out of print U.S. pressing of FALCO 3. I assume in the 80s there was an edit of this version as that was what we in the U.S. heard on the radio but I've never seen it show up on any Falco or 80s Hits compilation.Even harder to come by are the extended versions of 'Jeanny' and 'Coming Home (Jeanny Part 2)' the other two bonus tracks here. These are the original German 12' versions not the remixes from the Remix Hit Collection from the 1991. The extended version of 'Jeanny' appeared on the long out of print CD compilation MAXI HIT SENSATION and an English language version (12' UK Mix) appears on the Falco compilation HELDEN VON HEUTE. I've never seen the 12' version of 'Coming Home' on CD before.Falco was one of the most remixed artists in the 80s & 90s but the mixes remain hard to come by.

" When I first tried to use this card I had Windows Me and an external USB Ethernet between my computer and the modem for my High-Speed Cable service. It totally disconnected me from the internet when I tried to route it through the USB 2.0 ports. The Windows Internet Connection Wizard was of no help in getting me back online. I had to remove the circuit board and use the restore feature on my boot-up floppy just to get internet access through my USB 1.1 port again.In order to use this board for all other USB 2.0 devices and with internet access the solution ultimately came from a free self-install rollback program created by my ISP. It informed me that 14 internet settings had been changed by the (re)installation of this hardware/software.Two years later I reformatted my hard dive with Windows 2000 and got an external USB 2.0 Ethernet. Installation was easier because no driver software had to be installed with Windows 2000. I was now able to get internet access through the USB 2.0 ports but it frequently disconnected me.

For those with eyes to see and hears to hear this is a good place to find badly needed crossover spiritually inspired and simply really good music.

" When Painted by Memory came out last year I had trouble deciding how good the songs on it really were. Judgement was obscured by the contrasting production style that contained both lush and carefully planned orchastration to back up the free-floating vocals of Mr. Costello. Perhaps one album should have been done with the lush orchastration supporting a more appropriate voaclist such as Luthor Vandross or Elvis himself could have done simple piano and voice versions of these songs with his pianist Steve Nieve...but anyway here now is this beuatiful album successful in displaying the melody in these songs without drowing them in oversentimental backing. The rearrangement of 'Toldeo' with Elvis on vocals (singing WONDERFULLY the best I've ever heard him without a doubt a HUGE improvement on Painted by Memory) gets to the core of the song by having the ensemble trade off the vocal to convey the sitaution at hand. 'I Still Have that Other Girl' is now a short almost playful duet with Cassandra Wilson who also sings 'Painted by Memory' barroom style with a low husky voice backed only by Bill Frisell's solo guitar making one wish the whole album were done with vocals...that is until 'The Sweetest Punch' and the rest of the album are taken in not only proving how good these songs really are but standing out as wonderful album on it's own right that should be hailed as one of the best of the year.

With its coloration's airy expanded melodies and tangy '60s-meet-'90s flavor the 'alternative' version easily surpasses the 1998 original-credit for which goes to arranger guitarist and master eclectic Bill Frisell.Recorded shortly after 'Painted' but before Frisell heard more than piano demos of the songs 'Punch' features the crooning intensive Costello on one tune the cool dark-bodied Cassandra Wilson on another and the two vocalists on a third. But as played by a remarkable septet including clarinetist Don Byron trumpeter Ron Miles saxophonist Bill Drewes and trombonist Curtis Fowlkes all of the numbers sing. The music fills the room like a soundtrack for a movie romance you'd give anything to see. - Lloyd SachsChicago Sun-Times 09/26/99 Showcase section page 13 ",4.0

" From the end of the Cold War comes a movie that was probably written at the height of the Cold War went through several years of production and finally came out right at the end of the Cold War and this probably killed any chance it had at success. I mean who wants to watch a movie about Russians spies fighting US spies when you can get down with that sexy East German girl in your chem class while listening to the Scorpions' song 'Winds of Change' or that cool Jesus Jones ditty 'Right Here Right Now'? As a result this enjoyable action movie is a hidden gem that few people remember. On to the plot...SHO KOSUGI Star of tons of Japanese Ninja films plays a CIA spy who is called into action when a secret US plane an F-111 goes down in the waters off Malta. This sequence is probably the cheapest of the entire movie as we only get to LISTEN to the plane going down instead of WATCHING the plane crash. Guess they had to spend that extra money on Jean-Claude's body wax. Speaking of JC Mr. Van Damme plays the Russian martial arts expert/ body guard who is brought in by the KGB to try to steal the top-secret warhead off the F-111 before the CIA can get it. The only catch is first they both have to find where in the ocean the plane crashed...Along the way Sho kills multiple Maltese citizens and various KGB agents all while Jean-Claude romances a young lady on the KGB's tugboat. In fact all of the killing makes JC's character a lot more sympathetic than Sho's which I'm sure the producers did not intend. Anyway lots of action and things blowing up later there is the final showdown with Sho and JC which...well you'll have to watch the movie to see what happens. Take my word though it's a great fight scene.As the movie progresses the viewers are treated to scene after scene of the gorgeous Maltese countryside",4.0

" A reporter tries to balance his loyalty to friends with his personal integrity in this drama. Martin (Timothy Hutton) is a newspaperman from Detroit who has just published a book on organized crime. Doc (Joe Pantoliano) his close friend has low-level connections to the Mob and helped him get much of the information. While working on a story Martin meets Sara (Michelle Burke) an exotic dancer with a complex story. He and Sara find themselves attracted to one another and a romance grows between them but Sara is angered when Martin uses deeply personal details of her story in one of his columns. After Martin promises Sara he'll never again betray her confidence Doc approaches him with an offer -- a movie studio has expressed an interest in Martin's book and Doc is having a cash-flow problem that's put him in debt to Mob loan sharks. Why not make Doc the producer on the movie so he can make some quick money and pay off the thugs? While Martin weighs the wisdom of this course of action a studio chief tells Martin he's interested in his recent column about the stripper; if he can integrate the story into his book they're certain to make a deal. The Last Word also stars Richard Dreyfuss Chazz Palminteri Cybill Shepherd and Roma Downey. ...The Last Word ( Cosa Nostra",4.0
" It wasn't until the end credits when I saw that writer/director Tony Spiridakis' film was based on a play that I could fathom the reason for his Clifford Odets-ian blather which passes as dialogue. Spiridakis was fortunate to be able to direct his own material - he manages to make a contribution to the genre of wacked auteur classics which teeters between genius and lunacy. These kind of films have their own fascination and Spiridakis' is just as strangely compelling. I can imagine anybody else wanting to excise these pungently lyrical encounters and pare down the treatment to it's plot points but perhaps there is no way to do this since it's hard to genre-place the material. It begins in Detroit as a mafioso thriller of sorts with Chaz Palminteri threatening Timothy Hutton as a the writer of a column 'Scenes From Everyday Life'. Hutton has collected his writing into a book which has Palminteri in threatening mode since Hutton exposes the underworld low life which has 'consequences'. The title of Hutton's column and book scream irony and the notion of writer as a mythological figure a modern day Cassandra is perhaps a little too much of an ego trip for Spiridakis. Things become more surreal when Hollywood calls and options Hutton's book with the proviso that he includes the latter material he has published on a stripper named Caprice. Caprice is aptly named a 'class act' who strips wearing hideous clown orange glow lipstick and a peroxide wig to the sounds of classical music. (In the real world this kind of stripper would be fired after her first set). Naturally she and Hutton become an item and with Hutton's childhood friend Joe Pantoliano relocate to L.A. The L.A. scenes are said to show Hollywood's darker side though they are most memorable for the star cameos Spiridakis features. Richard Dreyfuss Tony Goldwyn Cybill Shepherd and Jimmy Smits make brief appearances (Smits gets 7 words) which is proof that either Spiridakis' dialogue can cast a wide spell or that he pays well. Palminteri only got one scene as well. Spiridakis presenst all this with a straight face with the occasional Toni Childs croaker on the soundtrack intercutting between Caprice painting and Hutton having sex with someone else split second flashbacks to Caprice's tragic past (which includes a Golden Boy violin) and an amusing opening with the entrance of a long-stemmed flower box thought to be a machine gun at Hutton's book launch. His screenplay features endlessly quotable thearical flourishes though my favourites are a line to Caprice - 'It's not easy to love the way you do and still be alive' and how Hutton is required to produce a screenplay 'with teeth'. Hutton performs his duets with Michelle Burke as Caprice in hushed reverential tones as opposed to the yelling that takes place between him and Pantoliano. Panoliano probably comes off the best since he tends to rush through his lines. There is an interesting parallel between the two men and the leads in Sweet Smell of Success with Pantoliano like Tony Curtis' Sidney Falco. Burke however comes off the worst. It doesn't help that she resembles Holly Hunter but having none of Hunter's ability and she gets Spiridakis'worst excesses like a montage of silent screams. Movies about Hollywood are always a little odd just from the fact that it doubles the illusion but this is one of the oddest. ",4.0

" Reading The Lawless Roads reminded me of a comment from Albert Camus from his notebooks",4.0
" The Lawless Roads is a non-fiction account of a trip Graham Greene took in 1937 to report on the persecution of Catholics in the Mexican states of Chiapas and Tabasco. This trip was the precursor to and inspiration for his greatest novel The Power and the Glory about a whiskey priest who becomes the last representative of Catholicism in a blighted Mexican province.As journalism the book is thin and cursory. We don't get much framing of why the Marxist government decided to outlaw Catholicism in the first place. Did the priestly class milk the peasants? Was this ancient creed bogging the society down in ignorance and superstition and preventing material progress? Did any of the Bishops commit financial personal or political indiscretions? Beyond a brief mention that it had to do with 'a war...for the soul of the Indian' we aren't told.Although he attends a few masses visits some ruined churches and meets with priests and bishops Greene spends little time talking to average Catholics. Since not observing the Church's rituals is a big sin these Catholics must have been living in an emotional pressure cooker but we don't see it. And Greene provides no justification for why Catholicism imposed under Spanish colonial rule deserves a central place in Mexican culture. He seems to assume the answer is obvious. Obviously it wasn't to the politicians and landowners who sent out the army to shoot priests and destroy churches.Absent journalism we get travelogue. It's clear that Greene is repulsed by the grubby sensuality of Mexico and he doesn't like Mexicans. His Spanish is limited which makes many of his interactions fraught and difficult. He is very often too hot or cold irritated by dogs and rats plagued by flies and mosquitoes sore from mule travel over rough roads. His Mexico is a place full of hate and death. Being the world class writer he was there are some compelling descriptions of flyblown mountain towns and the people in them but throughout he is clearly more repulsed than emphatically engaged.The most fascinating question raised by Greene's dyspeptic travelogue is this",4.0

Eclipsed by the simultaneous Great Chicago Fire and because few eyewitnesses actually survived to tell about it the Peshtigo firestorm never achieved the notoriety it should have and there are not many books about it. This one builds a suspenseful narrative out of the more reliable accounts and anecdotes of the fire and is studded with unforgettable images -- the self-herding house cats the pretty girl running down the flaming boardwalk the farmer who momentarily left his wife and children alone in the wagon ...The shipwreck story is a bonus.

" In this example filled guide to crucial confrontations - those times when holding someone accountable is critical to what is important to you - the authors present a relational model for what to do as you become aware of a gap between your expectations and what has or is happening in the specific situation.The concept approaches the crucial confrontation in `before' `during' and `after' steps; requiring you to spend some `before' time deciding `what' is the specific issue to be addressed and `if' you should enter into the crucial confrontation - what do you desire out of the relationship is a key question to help identify the real issue. Also in the `before' phase you are asked to master your emotions by considering not only `your story' but also by considering the other person's context and thus `their story' - are they really doing this because they want to fail with you? Probably not - they just have an entirely different perspective (their story) on the situation!The `during' step requires that you confront with safety and stay with the facts; assuring the other party that mutual respect and mutual purpose are present. The `after' step requires agreement on an action plan and follow-up. Along the way there are tools to avoid getting side-tracked with ample examples of situations that may arise and suggestions for dealing with them.

It is an easy and quick read and the language is very simple and direct. The book discusses ways to have a confrontation in which results are gained and friendships are not lost. It is a win-win approach. I do believe that this book can and does help. I did not particularily like the Crucial Conversations because it wasn't real earth shattering and seemed to simple. This time however the subject of 'confrontations' seems more open to the authors' intentions-- thus a better read.This is a good book to read and a better book to apply. ",4.0
" I surprised myself by reading almost the entire book during a two-week trip to Thailand w. The authors do a great job of showing how NOT stepping up has allowed catastrophic consquences to result. For example the co-pilot who chose not to speak up when the pilot was preparing to take off in freezing weather with ice building up on the wings. All that survived was the cockpit tape that has the copilot hinting at the danger and not taking a powerful stand with the pilot. Our circumstances are not likely to be that drastic but it is really very serious business.I like that the book recognizes that speaking up can be risky and talks about how to make reasonably sure that you won't hurt your career or relationship when you choose to speak up.The keys to managing the conversation so you don't get off in the weeds and get a valuable result begin with stepping back for a moment and remembering how you got to your reaction. The authors say we start by seeing or hearing something draw come conclusions react and then take action. If you review what exactly are the facts you started with and what are the interpretations or conclusions you came to you are free to share it as a story the other person can understand. If you speak as if your conclusions are facts you can lose the rapport you need to have a good outcome.I like the question the authors suggest asking yourself to get to how to start a conversation that doesn't amount to an attack",4.0
" The ideas presented in this book seem to be excellent ways to have critical oonversations but I found two things lacking. First reading about conversations and making them happen are two different things. Although it's no fault of the book I think it will be difficult to put these easily into play without practice.Second there are no examples I noticed where the outcome WAS as bad as it could be. For example one conversation centered on a man who suspects his wife of an affair. He confronts her only to find that she has a valid excuse for her actions and is not in fact unfaithful. What if she had said 'yes I'm having an affair'? There's no follow up when the answer IS what you've hoped it won't be. Those seem like they could be the most critical conversations of all. ",4.0

" Man of La Mancha / 0-394-40619-2Though I find the Don Quixote story to be moving and meaningful I am the first to admit that the full work of Cervantes can be incredibly daunting - not exactly light evening reading. 'Man of La Mancha' has managed to perfectly distill the Don Quixote story into a short heart-warming play that is if possible even greater than the source material.In 'Man of La Mancha' the ravings of our madman show us the veneer of the world we ought to live in. The character of Dulcinea is particularly touching - where those who would use and abuse her see only a whore broken by life's cruelties and painful necessities our mad hero sees a woman capable of love kindness and friendship. He sees a person with pain and sorrow and strength and inner beauty. How can we know that this view is 'insanity'? Perhaps it is the rest of the world that is mad and only our dear man of La Mancha has clear senses.~ Ana Mardoll ",4.0

" The second Metal Massacre compilation didn't introduce a legendary band like Metallica (Metal Massacre Vol. 1) or Slayer (Metal Massacre Vol. 3) but it still unleashed a wave of impressive artists from the developing California metal scene.The biggest names featured on Metal Massacre II are Armored Saint and Overkill both of which are (more or less) active to this day. The compilation also introduced cult metal favorites Obsession Savage Grace and Warlord. The rest of the artists featured here either had one-album careers (3rd Stage Alert Trauma Hyksos) or never released an album at all (Surgical Steel Dietrich Molten Leather Aloha). Trauma of course was Cliff Burton's pre-Metallica band and Aloha (later Hawaii) featured Marty Friedman pre-Megadeth.It's not the game changer that Metal Massacre I was but Metal Massacre II is still an important release in metal history. Between the bands that made it and those that were never heard from again Metal Massacre II is a great snapshot of the early 80's power and thrash metal scene that Metal Blade played such a large role in establishing.

" After ending her 1940's Warner Bros. contract due to dissatisfaction with the caliber of the roles she was being offered Joan Crawford moved into the next phase of her illustrious career as an independant performer choosing her own scripts. The first film she chose to undertake was 'Sudden Fear' based on a famous novel by Edna Sherry that she very sensibly optioned and saw as a perfect showcase for her by now mature talents as an actress. 'Sudden Fear' offered Crawford a terrific and most welcome change of pace from her last largely lacklustre efforts at Warners such as 'Goodbye My Fancy' and 'This Woman is Dangerous' and could be seen as the next installment in the continual redevelopment and redirection that Joan seemed to undertake careerwise at roughly 10 year intervals and the end result was truly remarable here. Providing Joan with her third well deserved Academy Award Nomination 'Sudden Fear' gave her the perfect transitional role into the more assertive characters she undertook through the 1950's and never has she been a more dynamic presence on screen than here where within the course of the action she evolves from potential victim to the one pulling the strings in a complex tale of cat and mouse intrigue and murder. Crawford for once in her mature career has a vehicle worthy of her talents and is tremendously aided by a wonderful script that contains nail biting suspense melodrama murder and interesting characterisations by the supporting cast.After Joan Crawford's career slump in the late 1940's 'Sudden Fear' proved to be a big success at the Box Office and certainly helped pave the way for the many 'take charge' characters that became her trademark from then on. Joan Crawford plays Myra Hudson a wealthy and highly successful playwright who as the story begins we find in a dilemma over what she feels is a wrong choice of actor. Feeling that actor Lester Blaine (Jack Palance) is definately not the type of leading man she had in mind she gets him fired from the production. Thinking that that is the end of the situation the play eventually opens to great acclaim however when Myra travels alone on the train to the West Coast for the plays opening there she encounters Lester again on the train and very soon a quite unexpected romance springs up between the former adversaries. After a whirlwind courtship Myra marries Lester and the pair settle down to domestic life in her San Francisco mansion. However Myra's happiness is short lived when by accident she overhears a conversation that was recorded on her copying machine between Lester Blaine and his old girlfriend Irene Neves (Gloria Grahame). Having heard that Myra intends to donate most of her fortune to charities Lester's real intent comes out and is unfortunately captured unbeknownst to him and Irene on Myra's tape. The pair intend to murder Myra before she gives away her fortune with Lester then inheriting her entire fortune after which he will marry the wily Irene. Overcoming her initial panic and heartwrending sense of betrayal by Lester Myra composes herself and utilizing her playwright's experience and imagination begins to concoct and then put into action an involved and utterly fascinating sequence of events to outwit the would be murderers at their own deadly game. Secretly fearing her devious husband but trying not to show her true feelings Myra continues to play the loving wife while putting her plan into action. Over the course of one evening Myra manages to evade being alone with Lester by pretending to be sick and leaves the house to set in motion her plan to frame Lester and get rid of Irene into the bargain. All does not go exactly as Myra plans however and she has to endure a terrifying pursuit by Lester through the deserted late night streets of San Francisco before a case of mistaken identity and a matching fur coat and scarf makes Lester believe he is just about to run down Myra in his car when in fact he is mistaken. The conclusion sees tragedy of a different kind result but which sees a shaken Myra able to walk away from the situation to a new life without her menacing husband.There are those that dismiss 'Sudden fear' as a 'camp' thriller however I feel it has its genuine moments of nail biting suspense that gives it its own corner in the noir thriller genre. Joan Crawford of course dominates the proceedings and her development of her character from trusting middle aged wife into first class schemer equal to her devious husband is a great achievement. Through much of the climax of the story once Myra puts her plan into execution Crawford uses her hugely expressive eyes to great effect which is best illustrated in the scene when she breaks into Gloria Grahame's apartment and is almost caught by her husband and has to hide in the closet. Crawford here is superb in conveying much of her feeling and emotions with very minimal dialogue. It's hard to imagine now but Crawford campaigned heavily for long time costar Clark Gable to play the role of Lester however the younger Jack Palance is perfect for this role ( he was also Oscar nominated here) as the younger man being supported by his wealthy older wife and his very distinctive looks make him an ideal villian in the story. He actually works very well with Joan Crawford despite their reported off screen lack of chemistry. Perrenial bad girl Gloria Grahame is superb in her role of Lester's trouble making old girlfriend out for a larger slice of the pie and prepared to murder for it. Grahame's distinctive speaking voice and hard exterior also add much to the role and she is perfectly deceitful in her scenes where she supposedly is being a new friend to the older Myra while secretly plotting her death. Grahame was so effective in the role that she too was rightly nominated for an Academy Award for her performance. Director David Miller gets well rounded performances from what is essentially a three character study in 'Sudden Fear' with the emphasis being on things not really being what they appear to be with any of these three main characters. Miller's direction of Joan Crawford in particular is especially effective and he manages throughout the story to keep her character just on the edge of potential tragedy then in the next instance brings the character full circle so that she is again in control of the stories proceedings. Another of the strong selling points of 'Sudden Fear' is its beautiful look with the strong elements of black and white light and shade courtesy of gifted cinematographer Oscar nominated Charles Lang greatly enhancing the films look and feel and it works superbly in the moments of high tension such as Lester's pursuit of Myra through darkened streets lit only by dim far off lamp lights. Along with the superb lighting the great use of many San Francisco locations for the exterior shots also adds greatly to the films overall look.'Sudden Fear' is one of my favourite later Joan Crawford vehicles and despite losing the Oscar that year I feel she was most deserving of a second nod after her earlier win in 'Mildred Pierce'. I can't say that Jack Palance is really a favourite actor of mine but I feel he made ideal casting here and 'Sudden Fear' really helped in setting him along in the successful career he had later on. Joan Crawford I always find a terrific performer and too often she seems to be relegated into the 'camp' school of acting by critics and public alike. Here she does have a character worthy of her considerable and often underrated talents and she makes the most of it in 'Sudden Fear'. For all lovers of suspense and nail biting tension 'Sudden fear' makes a great addition to any film collection and is an important film to look at when seeking to understand the enduring popularity of movie legend Joan Crawford.

" Most of the previous reviewers have done an excellent job of outlining the plot details of this fine older film. I have just a few comments to add.Since DVDs have arrived and video has become a stepchild we have an excellent opportunity to view old favorites with little impact on the purse. Sometimes a visit to old haunts proves our memory a little faulty or shows the film itself just hasn't aged well.I loved this movie that first time around and it proved to be just as wonderful in a recent memory lane visit.Joan Crawford never one of my favorite actresses deserved the Oscar for this performance not just a nomination. It was definitely one of her best. She was able to convey the 'fear' without making one groan at any overacting. She portrayed a bright woman with a fear a plan a conscious and a heart with brilliance and with just the right amount of conviction.Jack Palance conversely always a favorite of mine was his menacing best in this performance without having to overact for a second. The perfect role played to perfection.It is always enjoyable to see the work of stars you have forgotten were in favorite old films. Touch (Mike) Conners (TV's Mannix) played Sonny in this film which didn't rumble back into memory when I watched him each week on TV but I recognized his name in the opening credits immediately this time. It was very interesting to watch him in retrospect in an early effort (perhaps his first?).Hollywood in their infinite wisdom seems to have decided that today's audiences are too jaded too sophisticated too juvenile or too something to enjoy a simple thriller in the ilk of 'Sudden Fear' 'Midnight Lace' or other great 'woman-in-distress/woman-with-a-plan films unless they modern-it-up as in 'Panic Room'. Perhaps they know a thing or two since they are wealthy and I work a 9-to-5 job and post reviews on a website.However speaking for myself and hopefully for other viewers who still enjoy; a simple plot with character-study suspense b/w beauty and pleasure while viewing 'Sudden Fear' tells a great story in a suspenseful manner. I still makes for great viewing. Grab yourself a bargain and enjoy! ",4.0

" Perfect casting careful pacing and precise characterizations are the specialties of this suspenseful film noir. Of particular interest is the plot's patient development of the relationship between Crawford and Palance an intricate bond that continues to intrigue as the harmony of their home begins to ring hollow. Palance's powerful sex appeal is like a lightning rod that draws both Crawford and Grahame and though nothing in the storyline comes as a shock the details are utterly jolting! ",4.0

" Once I finally broke down and bought a DVD player I thought the only possible way to break it in was with an unfamiliar film by my beloved Joan Crawford 1952's Sudden Fear. The film is a real thriller sort of a higher-class film noir forerunner of some of the more exciting horror films she made in the 1960s (Strait-Jacket and Berserk come to mind; I won't watch Baby Jane because I can't stand to see Joan be mistreated).Joan is magnificent as a wealthy heiress/playwright who becomes the target of a murder plot by her actor husband (Jack Palance) and his girlfriend (Gloria Grahame whose scene-stealing performance is almost worth the price of the film). Joan becomes privy to the murder plan thanks to the advanced electronic technology in her San Francisco mansion. Always the playwright she uses her plot-devising skills to foil the murder attempt but backs out at the last second from carrying out her plan. We do however at least get the satisfaction of seeing what she had intended through a kind of dream sequence which left me cheering.Up to the last few minutes of the film I felt it definitely deserved five stars. However the ending is a bit of a letdown; it is far too dependent on mere chance to be satisfactory. I couldn't help thinking that a better ending that arose more naturally from the plot could have been devised. For example if Joan had carried it out the dream sequence would have been a great improvement over the ending we have and confirmed once more her regular screen persona of being in charge of every situation.Nevertheless Sudden Fear is an engrossing and exciting film. It was a great way to both break in my new DVD player and to spend an evening not to mention being a valuable addition to my appreciation of Joan Crawford the actress. ",4.0
" We all know how famous Crawford was for the melodramas' and the often overacting (think of Queen Bee). However in Suddent Fear she is truly convincing as the wife who has just discovered her husband is out to kill her hence the title.Some very tense scenes in this classic film noir. Crawford herself disputed the choice of Jack Palance as the leading man saying he was not attractive enough for the lead. She was right he looked very odd almost plastic. That aside Jack still puts in a good performance.The DVD is heavily overpriced. Why it needs to be so expensive is anyone's guess. Especially considering the dismal transfer to DVD. Yes it is as bad as you have read about in other reviews. No Restoration whatsoever. No extras. Should really be alot cheaper than it is. You are paying for Joan Crawford really. ",4.0

" Before I begin my review of 'Sudden Fear' in earnest I have to point out that this is a really poor transfer to DVD of a 1950's noir classic. Movies like 'Mildred Pierce' and 'The Women' are much older films but of a far better picture and sound quality.That said it's a good thing that this is finally available on DVD while other Crawford classics like 'Flamingo Road' are still languishing in the Vault someplace.Now on with the review. Joan plays Myra Hudson the successful and wealthy San Francisco playwright who after having fired him from her latest hit production falls in love with and marries an actor named Lester Blaine (Jack Palance). Against all sense and reason Myra attempts to change her will to leave him with everything but an overheard conversation between the conniving unfaithful Lester and his scheming girlfriend Irene (Gloria Grahame) forces her to think very differently. A shocking climax ensues.Made in 1952 this is Joan's first independent picture (for RKO Pictures) and revived a flagging career. What we see here is what I like to refer to as Middle-Era Joan being neither the ultra-glamorous 1940's Joan of 'Mildred Pierce' and 'The Women' nor the screechy scary Joan of 'Baby Jane' and 'Strait-Jacket'. She turns in a classic Crawford performance as the hapless Myra full of facial tremblings and overpronunciation. She's excellent as the Victim but this is perhaps her best performance in a film outside of 'Mildred Pierce' and 'Flamingo Road'. She is touching in the love scenes and tense and compelling in the suspense scenes. What's also remarkable is the fact that she plays the part of the older-but-none-the-wiser Myra with such honesty instead of trying to make this on-the-shelf spinster any younger than the script allows.Jack Palance is excellent too as the duplicitous Lester. He's loving and warm with his wife but menacing and hateful in the private moments with Irene. His face is hypnotic sometimes it's difficult to watch anything else on the screen but he does an brilliant job with a character who swings between two extreme poles of emotion.Gloria Grahame is simply astonishing in her role as Irene Neves. She is cold manipulating and possesses a strange kind of open-mouthed blatant sexuality that makes her wholly believable as the Mistress. She pouts schemes and demands her way into the picture and her performance in what is essentially a supporting role easily stands up to heavyweights like Crawford and Palance.Direction by David Miller is somewhat experimental for the period but excellent. The darkness and angles used in lighting the piece gives a real sense of the noir and the long one-shot scenes add a huge sense of tension and fear.The ending of the movie is slightly contrived and a little quick but we are still left with a tense psychological thriller that stands up today as a fine example of film-making. Highly recommended. ",4.0
" What a hoot of a film! It is a classic Joan Crawford 'Queen Bee poor me the victim' story. Crawford plays an ultra-wealthy San Franciscan socialite who writes incredably successful plays in New York City - non-stop! Plus she's just so nice and polite that when she doesn't think the new leading man is sexy enough she can't bear to fire him - so she gets someone else to. BIG mistake! Poor Joan 'falls in love' with conniving rejected actor. Actor then schemes with Gloria Grahame (of 'Oklahoma's' girl who can't say 'no' fame) to well...it doesn't matter. Joan's character is so annoying blind to the scheme that even when she has blatant evidence of the 'plot against her' she has this extended drawn-out wild-eyed scene of disbelief that is; well hard to friggin' believe! What fantastic overacting! The ending is predictable and a little far fetched. Palance is great as the 'bad' actor and Grahame was so young but so good! She deserved an Oscar for this performance. The last minute is surreal. Joan's character turns from deathly horrified to a smiling 'life is going to be okay' facade in less than 60 seconds! Talk about wrapping up a film as quickly as possible!Trivia",4.0
" Not many fans of Joan Crawford are familiar with this film but they should be. Attractive San Francisco location shooting and a superb supporting cast featuring Jack Palance Mike (`Touch') Conners and Gloria Grahame raise the bar of this exciting nail biter noir classic despite a rather simple and familiar plot. What's fascinating about the film is how director David Miller takes a familiar plot and presents the drama within it in a most entertaining and absorbing fashion. Crawford plays a successful San Francisco heiress/playwright Myra Hudson who falls for Lester Blaine (Palance) an actor who unsuccessfully auditioned for one of her plays. They eventually meet on a train back to San Francisco and after a whirlwind courtship the two eventually get married but after a few months into the marriage Myra later catches on that Lester and his old flame Irene (Grahame) intend to kill her so he can inherit her fortune.Note Director David Miller's brilliant cinematography--how he effectively telegraphs the use of ordinary objects--an initialed handkerchief a key a Dictaphone machine (even a small clockwork mechanical dog!) and his successful use of dissolves light and shadow and mise-en-scene to convey the terror and fear that not only registers on Crawford's expressive face within the frame but is carried thru an entire scene. In this film Crawford perhaps most successfully exhibits the strong yet vulnerable characters she made a long career out of playing. Although the intended victim of a nefarious plot to take her life and her fortune we see how Crawford's Myra Hudson consciously and methodically intends to turn the tables on her unfaithful paramour and his lover just as if she writing a plot synopsis outline for one of her plays.This was Palance's first 'starring' role after his smallish role in the classic 'Panic in the Streets' with Richard Widmark. He admirably conveys both the aura of vulnerability and deceit necessary to charm Crawford's character into believing he is her doting loving husband. While this is not in the same league as say 'Mildred Pierce' it should be considered as one of Crawford's better films and as it stands it is a superlative achievement in film noir. ",4.0
" If you never liked Joan this film may change your mind. Her royal Crawfordship uses all the skills she learned from her days as a silent star to convey a woman attempting to outsmart her diabolical young husband & his girl. She uses that chiseled face and those big eyes to great advantage. Her reactions to a walking toy dog while hiding in a closet are priceless. She was nominated for this performance as was her rival Bette Davis for 'The Star' (ironically playing a character rumored to be based on Joan!) Of the two Joan's performance is the winner this time.Jack Palance is brute-hunkable as the husband and Gloria Grahame puts the film in her pocket and walks away with it. If Gloria Grahame is your competion than you SHOULD be worried! Ms. Grahame won the supporting actress award that year but for 'The Bad & the Beautiful'. (although this film as well as 'The Big Heat' show her at her devious best)As Joan once said 'If you want 'the girl next door' then go next door!' Just make sure it isn't Gloria Grahame. ",4.0

" This is Usher's fourth live DVD concert to be released I believe. Of the last three I believe this is my least favorite. It is good though. It just seems rushed...and Usher just seems to be more than a little bored. It could just be the way it was recorded I'm not sure. He's doing his thing though and the dancers and musicians are certainly on point. Usher didn't seem to relate to the audience too much this time out. Maybe it was editing I'm not sure but for me it's an important part of any show. You want the audience to at least believe you're having a good time doing what you're doing!... I don't think the London show was a good show to record. The crowd seemed a bit tame to me. Stateside would have been much better I believe... The entrance was hott! U really don't get to see how really good this is until you look at the DVD extras! It's great. The song selection staging dancing and costumes are all excellent as well.

Also being a huge fan and not familiar with the song 'Monster' which the DVD opened with was a little off putting. The dancers were fabulous as was the set and Usher himself. The crowd seemed a little subdude to me and perhaps that is why Usher didn't seem as into it or as playful as usual. He also kept it pretty clean for which I was a little disappointed. We all know Usher can move his hips and it wasn't enough thrusting for me lol. Despite of these little things I enjoyed the DVD and would recommend it. ",4.0

" 'Overkill' was released in 1979 and have stood the test of time very well. It still sounds great and the tracks included are among the best in Motorhead's almost 30 year long career. Even `tho the title track ain't so good as many claim there are lots of other great songs. Some well known like 'No class' 'Damage case' and 'Stay clean' but also more 'rare' gems in the shape of 'I won't pay your price' and 'I'll be your sister'.Lemmy & Co show us that Motorhead is far more than sheer noise and the fact is that this album with hindsight isn't that heavy or speedy at all. It's more of energized rock and roll and all references to punk rock is totally wrong. This is Motorhead's second best effort after 'Ace of spades'.

" Femalien is probably among the most famous softcore movies to date thanks to its undeniably campy premise and graphic sex. I don't know softcore films usually bore me but there are exceptions (like The Erotic Witch Project The Alien Files Casting Couch) and this is one of them.Part of the reason's got to be the silly sci-fi premise which is about a female alien (get it femalien?!) who comes to Earth to observe humans engage in sexual interaction. By that alone this softcore film has more plot than three average late-night cable flicks combined. So basically the movie doesn't consist of much more than 90 minutes of this femalien (played by Venesa Talor) calling herself Kara in a hilariously dumb scene watching people have sex while getting off on it even occasionally joining in on the fun. Well okay there is the subplot with the chick named Sun (Jacqueline Lovell) who owns a diner that's about to be shut down by a guy who owns a massaging company but it pretty much exists only as a set-up for Talor and Lovell to get it on.Femalien has a pretty decent sense of humor which also places it above most films of its kind. Yeah the jokes are awful but they have a unique anti-charm that works in its favor (and Venesa Talor is so gosh-darned gorgeous you can't help but get sucked in by her character's naivete).There are numerous sex scenes in this film so I'll give a rundown of the highlights. Let's see there's the photoshoot segment which is actually probably the film's highlight. Whoever the actress is playing the other part of this coupling during this scene I'd like to know her name. Simply put she's hot. The other standouts include Venesa Talor's two love scenes there's the superior one with the guy in the diner and another very graphic one with Jacqueline Lovell which is so graphic I could almost swear they were really going at it. Nice.Performances are mostly really bad though Venesa Talor in a campy B-movie way excels as the hottie alien. It's got to be the naive way she approaches every situation which isn't too unlike Starman but come on she's easier on the eyes than Jeff Bridges. Okay that's an understatement considering she's one of the sexiest women I've ever seen. Yeah she's had work done on her (now very large) breasts but I for one think they look great and at any rate are far more of a turn on than the ludicrous basketballs on Shauna O'Brien's chest.Femalien sure isn't a good movie not by a long shot but it's an enjoyably silly one that can be easy to take thanks to non-stop sex and nudity. There's also a sequel but I have yet to see the uncut version of it (which sort of defeats the purpose of watching softcore).[three and a] 1/2 out of [five stars] ",4.0
" This was my first venture into any explicit sex movie. The acting was well bad. But who's really watching it for that? Some of the women were cute but mostly fake. One or two of the guys were hot.Kara has just beamed down from a planet that wants to study human sensations. She's naked in the first scene and for most of the rest of the movie. It starts when she sees her neighbor sun-tanning and wanting her guy to put oil on her so she won't burn. After not alot of coaxing they start going at it right there in the yard completely naked in multiple positions. Kara experiments by herself watching them and then gets off while watching people she's 'touched' (she makes them feel really good). She makes some models do it a guy at a cafe then two women at a lingerie store get it on just for Kara to watch. They invite her to a kinky party with just women and she gets 'some more experience'. The best part is the end where there are three couples at a meditation center that Kara touches. She always wants more experience.To sum it up plot 20% of the movie. Sex scenes 80%. Definitely more guy erotica but it was good for its purpose. Could've used more guys in it though. I'd buy it again. ",4.0

Maybe the scene will seem kinky to a really Vanilla person but hardly anyone else. The actors were so-so. They didn't look bored but didn't seem to put much into their roles. Most of the acress were agmented and in one case had the profile that comes from a bad job of surgury. The main star had a wonderful face which reminded me of Jennifer Tilly.

I would recommend this book; it is an easy read and does give a lot of information about the parables. Maybe if I were to read it a second time I'm sure I would get more out of the book.

IKE went right over our area-we were without electricity almost two weeks and this fan really did help. It runs on batteries so it won't blast you with a lot of air but it creates a steady breeze so you can sleep at night. ",4.0

" This is a very compact book easily carried in a shirt pocket. Which makes it all the more impressive considering the amount of information that is contains. My only real complaint of the book is that though it is organized into sections like 'checking into a hotel' or 'ordering food' it can sometimes be difficult to find the phrase you are looking for at the time you need it. However after having made a few trips to Thailand now I now realize how good this book is. What I would recommend is that you read through the book before you travel and highlight key phrases you think you might use. Normally for a phrasebook that might be painful to try to read through it but this book has a lot of interesting information on Thai culture customs food history etc. that it isn't simply a list of phrases or a dictionary. And if you are like me and a little slow to pick up languages you will find the book even more useful after a few trips to Thailand. ",4.0
" Wendy Ulmer shows the power of imagination and love in this tale of Billy's own private Badlands. Loudly illustrated by Kenneth Spengler's gouache portrayals of New York City touched by young Billy's Western imagings the book weaves a tricky path between pure entertainment and message. For the most part it succeeds.Billy sees a broken truck with vehicles waiting behind it as a wagon train needing repair. Spengler draws a big truck but he cleverly winds the street and vehicles around in a semicircle to suggest Billy's embellishment of the scene. Similarly the urban hot dog vendor is at once a NYC vendor and a chuck wagon man (implied simply by his handkerchief and scraggly face). When Billy enters the 'Badlands' by way of a shortcut through the 'arroyo' he remembers a trick that his grandfather taught him to hide and then switch back to his destination",4.0
" I simply love Henry's piano.With only a drummer(who seemed to want to be heard last on these recordings)his vibrant voice is really superb throughout.Although we have heard these tunes before these renderings are really top class.Unfortunately there are some Zydeco type tracks on this CD hence the title.I would have preferred this being a Henry Gray with drummer only CD with more tracks.That would have been something!I do like Zydeco but not together on a CD with Henry Gray!

" Take Dostoyevsky's 'Notes from the Underground' mix it with the Biblical stories of Job's travails and Jacob's wrestling simmer for 60 years stir in American optimism and the popular career book 'What Color is Your Parachute' bring to a rolling boil remove from heat let cool serve and you'll have Bruce Moody's memoir 'Will Work for Food or $.'All who have encountered beggars in America should read Mr. Moody's memoir. It makes no difference whether you've agonized over the plight of beggars as I have or criticized them for being too picky in their job searches as I also have. You will find Moody's experiences and soul searching powerful and interesting on several levels.Moody's memoir takes us into the mind and experiences of an honest senior citizen begging for work to stay afloat. His experience is not the result of a contrived self-imposed literary or journalistic assignment but instead comes from his struggle to survive and keep his home. Political and intellectual motives can drive authors to concoct or artificially partake of experiences inorder to make points or satisfy intellectual curiosity but such works lack the deep poetic soul searching and humor of Moody's work.His memoir contains much more than temporal descriptions of financial and employment predicaments. It reveals Moody's deepest thoughts of optimism self-doubt prejudice humility spirituality pride desire honesty discipline and survival. It stays away from politicizing and intellectualizing the problems of homelessness and poverty in America and instead focuses on people in their essence in face-to-face encounters. He doesn't confine his spiritual thoughts to an abstract world but lets them stand and sit freely with him by the roadside. People frequently surprised Moody while he begged and me too as I read the book.Moody's writing style reflects the openness and honesty of his accounts. He is not constrained by rules of grammar. His writing is more akin to poetry and therefore better conveys his thoughts and emotions than prosaic proper English. He knows what he's doing though and I'm not the only one who thinks so",4.0
" This book was handed to me by the president of our company about five months ago with the instructions 'Read this. I think it will change the way we build software.' Turns out he was right.The basic tenet of this book is that in a rapidly changing and uncertain environment companies must delay basic technology decisions as long as possible in order to best understand the context in which their product will be used. Changes in context can (i.e. new technologies changing market requirements competitive products) can take a product with killer potential and turn it into a market flop within weeks. This applies to manufacturing and system design as well as my industry software and was something that we ourselves had experienced.Iansiti's writing style is fairly dry and the exhaustive statistical analysis of his research can be well exhausting. I found myself skimming the middle of almost every chapter while he proved his points so I could get to the good stuff",4.0

" Of course much is lost in the translation of 'The Good Soldier' from page to screen chiefly the narrative and temporal complexities of the novel. However the television adapatation is successful in its use of time shifts and like Ford's work the film is impressionistic often showing us a scene twice to give the viewer two different impressions.However we lose Dowell's process of writing itself and his relation with the reader. In the film Dowell is mainly absent from the last third of the story because it is told from Leonora's perspective whereas in the novel Dowell's voice is dominant throughout even when he is recounting what has only been told him.Of course any book - especially a modernist novel - loses a good deal of its complexity in the transition to film and 'The Good Soldier' is on the whole a successful adaptation of the novel much better than the adpatations of other modernist novels I've seen like 'Ulysses' and 'Mrs. Dalloway.' The film was shot on location in Nauheim and elsewhere in Germany which shows the care this production takes with Ford's work.The four principals are all excellent in their roles particularly Jeremy Brett and Susan Fleetwood as the Ashburnhams. The score was excellent as well. The production also keeps Dowell's voiceovers to a minimum which may be something of a loss but it is welcome in a televison adpatation which thankfully shows us a great deal of the action instead of telling.Overall then I found this adaptation of 'The Good Soldier' to be one of the more successful installments of 'Masterpiece Theater' and probably one of the best film made from a modernist novel that I have seen. While we lose the complexities of Dowell's narration and his potential unreliabilty the film utilizes the time-shifts and impressionistic technique of Ford's novel and there are subtle hints that Dowell may know more than he lets on. Thus the film's success stems from its faithfulness to the aesthetic spirit of Ford's novel.Caveat",4.0
" The Good Soldier is a rather haunting period story and film with many delicate layers of meaning and subtle character revelations made more complex because they are seen from different perspectives but also (paradoxically) because often they are seen rather than spoken of. The contrast between the measured elegance of the couples and the anguish (it is revealed) that seethes below the surface of their leisurely even lazy lifestyle is absolutely rivetting.Although it is essentially a sad story - the 'soldier' of the title seems at first to be the villain then turns out to be the victim - Jeremy Brett's performance is such that this scarcely matters one is more struck by the quality of his portrayal which far surpasses the undeniable excellence of the other actors. Brett is able with a minimum of words and the slightest gesture or fleeting expression to reveal an entire sea of his character's suffering.The tale is set in the Edwardian era yet its theme of social relationships is surprisingly modern (with its overtones of wife-swapping extra-marital affairs etc).The viewer can't help but be drawn into the lives of the characters trapped as they seem to be with their pain and age-old human problems. It is a brilliant film and a special one. ",4.0
" I am a very visual person so I can sit through lots of meaningless despair as long as it photographed in beautiful settings with lots of lush costumes and fantastic architecture. This film has all of that. It helps that the cast is strong and rather attractive too. It makes for a 'good show.'As for the content well...I found the story interesting told as it is from the view point of the man who was deceived. First we see the splendid surface--the two wealthy couples one American one English in a German spa pre-World War I. They spend several years together performing as the narrator says a 'minuet.' A lovely picture. Then the narrator lets us in to the story behind the story almost as he has discovered it. From reading some of the reviews of the book it seems that the narrator is much more befuddled than he is portrayed in the film. That may be a flaw in the translation of book to film...I don't know. As the layers of the characters peel away and we learn of the rotten-ness at the core of the apple (his words) the story intensifies or as they used to say 'the plot thickens.'My attention was held throughout mostly by the strength of the actors and the visual splendors. The plot itself doesn't have much to offer modern audiences. We know about adultery betrayal revenge hypocrasy. There is nothing here that illumines any of the characters raises them up to a higher plane. No one changes learns anything grows transcends his dire situation. Most of the players chose cowardly outs---three out of five chose suicide and one descends into madness. So I wasn't left with a particularly satisfied feeling at the end.The main character who is supposed to be the befuddled weakling was played by the charming Robin Ellis who I fell in love with in the tv series 'Poldark.' That's probably what kept my interest--not a great reason. But he remains as befuddled at the end as he was in the beginning. So one could ask 'What's the point of all this?' Perhaps Ford Maddox Ford was using this as a means to discover answers to his the riddles of his own life. Here he offers us questions but no answers.I suppose there is more value to the story if one were to read the novel but having seen this I don't think I'll bother. I give it four stars just for the splendid production. (It was really funny to see John Ratzenberger Cliff Claven the mail man in 'Cheers' in a totally different setting.) ",4.0
" I saw this on its original run on American PBS in 1983 taped it to VHS at the time convinced it was one of the best things I'd ever seen on television. As per most of the other reviews this is a very well done respectful adaptation of the Ford novel with enough back-and-forth timing shifts to delight many a Tarantino fan (we see many scenes repeated filling in the previous narration from several angles until a picture emerges at odds against the original impressions. It is a clever and tricky way to tell a story that has to avoid confusing the audience).The only deficiency I want to mention is the production value on the DVD release. Colors are washed out and focus is soft. Transfer is still superior to a straight-from-VHS copying but still the print used is somewhat beaten up with dirt and spotting throughout (especially at the beginning). Sound is about in the same shape.With all of the work that obviously went into presenting this Victorian 'impressionist' drama in an historically accurate manner with enormous women's hats and elegant rooms with overstuffed furniture and heavy drapes it is a shame it is all mitigated by using a damaged source print.

" If you love this repertoire (early C20 english music/cello) you can't go too far wrong with this lovely disc. The Ireland is quite well known and deservedly but the Moeran and Rubbra less well known. The neglect is undeserved - the Rubbra is taut and cogent (as you'd expect) and the Moeran is intimate and rhapsodic (as you'd expect).It (the Moeran) was written for Peers Coetmore then the composer's fiance later his wife and dedicatee of Moeran's absolutely superb cello concerto (her performance on an old Lyrita LP was one othe treasures of my vinyl collection). Wallfisch is a champion of english cello music usually on Chandos and sometimes on Naxos and can be relied upon for at least fine playing sometimes inspired (as on his Finzi recording for Chandos).This isn't quite at the Finzi concerto level and possibly reflects a little less familiarity with the pieces(??) but is certainly good as is the sympathetic playing of john York. Nor is the recording quite at the level of some of Chandos' cello recordings although its certainly good.For those reasons and because the sonatas whilst lovely are slightly-less-than-top drawer compared to the very best works of all three composers I've gone for a curmudgeonly (and possibly mean) four stars rather than five for a disc of interest distinction and reward.

" An interesting CD which gets better each time I listen..Being used to the basic home grown Cajun style of four or five people standing around an echoey room the 'Big (ish) band' style of the CD came as a bit of a shock - initially somewhat disapointing.. But now I love it! ",4.0
" A beautifully photographed subject the text provides outstanding detail on different plant varieties in addition to general information on climbers--growing them and sustaining them. The book is organized by types of climbers and I will say it expanded my thinking about climbers and their uses. An excellent three pages on care and cultivation with pruning diagrams. Those might just be worth the price of the book itself. The downside is that it is not area specific and I wonder which of those in the book are either available or suitable for southern California.

" Whatever you have read in the previous reviews is right. Installing this card is a bit tricky but once you get it all right it is defintely worth the effort and the money you put into this card. It took me 6 hours to get this card and the software working. I have included some very important points I noted while installing is card. Please take note of them so that you can install the card in a much shorter time.(BTW I have a custom build PIII 800MHz PC with 320 MB memory Win 2K and a good old AGP 2X/4X ATI Rage Mobility card previously installed.)1. First of all NEVER forget to remove the previous display drivers !! Use the uninstall program that came bundled with the software for the previous display driver (EASIEST method). In my case I had no uninstall software to remove the previous display driver. So I used regedit to clear the registry entries for that driver and used the safe mode to remove the DLL files corresponding to that driver (NOT recommended except for a last ditch effort).Remove the previous card (hardware) and install this card ONLY AFTER thoroughly removing the display drivers of the previous card.2. When you reboot the system (in NORMAL mode) after hardware installation Windows will display a 'New Hardware Found' message. Allow it to install the Windows standard VGA driver (it will only display the 640 x 480 mode). Check the display properties to make sure it displays something like 'standard VGA' or something related. (If it still shows the name of the previous display driver go back and try removing the previous driver until you get Windows to use the standard VGA driver).3. If you have the software for the motherboard drivers re-install the one for the AGP. (one of the recommendations on the ATI website in case you get a blank or garbled screen after you install the new drivers).4. In my case the software that came on the CD never worked !! I ended up getting either a garbled screen or the computer hangs at a blank screen. So I went to the ATI website downloaded the latest drivers and viola !! everything worked perfect !! (Note",4.0

" I'd never even heard of 'Legionaire' until a skit on 'Saturday Night Live' (where Kris Kattan portrayed VanDamme) made fun of the fact that nobody saw this movie. I of course thought that this movie must be godawful so I rented it just to be entertained by its horribleness. But I was amazed at what a great movie this was! It was kind of cheesy in places (like those stupid flashbacks that are supposed to be heartwarming and touching but are really just annoying) but the action sequences are really good. I'm surprised that a decent movie like this goes straight to video while other movies which are far more lame and stupid make it to the big screen. If you rent it you won't be disappointed especially if you have low expectations to begin with ",4.0
" This is only the second Van-Damme movie I have really enjoyed the other being Cyborg. This movie is a real old-fashioned adventure like they used to make visually striking with great camera work and spectacular battles. There was no over-used Kung-Fu no tired technological gadgets and best of all no James Cameronesque 'tough-guy' talk (Nobody shouts 'Let's ROCK N' ROLL!' etc.) In short Legionnaire is a completely entertaining adventure story with none of the sickening '90s 'attitude' that makes so many adventure films today unwatchable. This movie deserved theatrical release! Lets hope Van Damme continues to make great historical adventures. I'd like to see him do one about Camerone in Mexico 1863 which was one of the battles that 'made' the French Foreign Legion. If you like Legionnaire watch any of the Beau Geste movies or try to find March Or Die (1977) starring Gene Hackman and Terence Hill. ",4.0
" Van Damme has a few movies under his belt but they are a mixed bunch that's for sure. Legionnaire however is one of Van Damme's better movies. Van Damme plays a Frenchman who joins the Foreign Legion after a tangled love affair goes wrong. We get some action before Van Damme joins the Legion by way of boxing matches and then we are provided with some quality military action set in the desert. I must confess to enjoying this movie. Van Damme didn't overact and he actually suited the role. His supporting cast also did a nice job. The locations were quite inspiring. The script was very cliche in parts but was acceptable. The highlight for me was the ambush and climatic battle scene in the latter stages of the movie. They were very well done. Overall a well done action movie set around an uncommon theme and location. Recommended. ",4.0
" I grew up watching 'Beau Geste' (which is a film which deserves to be on DVD)and all other films about the French Foreign Legion fall or rise to that film's greatness. That being so 'Legionnaire' stands as a solid drama of the men who join the legion to forget their past lives and to rebuild new ones--if they survive. The film is well-crafted and the wide-screen format is perfect in bringing the viewer the feel of the desert--its vastness its heat and its beauty. The film's action scenes are sensational and the final battles are both memorable and brutal. Jean-Claude Van Damme proves he is more than just a good body or fighting machine--he does some fine acting in this film. One wishes that it could be seen on the large screen--it deserves it. ",4.0
" Legionnaire is a flashback to the old Foreign Legion films starring Gary Cooper like Beau Geste or Gunga Din. The movie tells the story of a boxer who betrays a French mob boss when he goes back on a deal. He is then forced to join the Foreign Legion when he has nowhere else to turn too. The film follows the training of the new company and then there battles against the Rif tribesmen. This film is very different from most of Jean-Claude Van Damme movies but it is very good. He doesn't fight throughout the movie instead actually talking although there are plenty of action scenes.Surprisingly Van Damme is very good as Alain DuChamps the boxer forced into the Legion. He is very believable in the role. The supporting cast for this movie stands out as above average compared to other Van Damme action movies. Nicholas Farrell is excellent as Macentosh the ex-soldier with a weakness for gambling. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje plays Alain's friend Luther a man fed up with his past and how he's been treated. He is excellent in the supporting role to Van Damme and Farrell. Also starring are Steven Berkoff and Jim Carter. This is an excellent movie with grand landscapes in the African landscape well put together action scenes and believable characters. This movie deserved better than its straight to video release. The DVD offers widescreen presentation a theatrical trailer and teaser rare photographs of the Foreign Legion in action and several behind the scenes documentaries and interviews with the cast and crew. There is plenty here for Van Damme fans and also action fans. Check this movie out! ",4.0
