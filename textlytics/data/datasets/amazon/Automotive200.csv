 A friend gave me this book a couple of years ago and I find that I return to it again and again. It is a series of 365 short meditations on being in relationship with God. The meditations can be at times astoundingly difficult to understand. But every now and then one pops out that is so perfect I am convinced that this crazy Spanish mystic must have been on to something.If you are trying to deepen your relationship with the Divine do yourself a favor, 5.0

 I ordered this puzzle for my 2 year old grandaughter. She loved it!It was very colorful and she could easily remove the pieces of the puzzle because of the little pegs on each piece. She recognized the different pictures and likes things that are familiar to her. I like the variety of pictures compared to all animals or all trucks etc. The puzzle board is very sturdy and should endure for many years.The shipping was prompt also. All in all it was a perfect gift for her. , 5.0
 We got this for my son when he was 16 months old. He is now 24 months old and he has long outgrown it. However it was played with multiple times every day for several months and is still in great shape. He really liked this puzzle but he LOVED the transportation theme puzzle from the same company. We used it to work on vocabulary hand-eye coordination and print recognition - I printed the name of the object on the back of each piece and sometimes we looked at them that way. This puzzle is MUCH better than any Melissa and Doug puzzle we own. , 5.0
 My son absolutely loves this puzzle. The colors on the pieces are bright vibrant and appealing. We love that it has 15 pieces since it keeps him engaged a little longer than most puzzles. , 5.0

 Everything about this album has 1981 written all over it. Synth pop at its extreme yet that's what was 'in' back then. Listening to it now takes some strength but it's a classic all the same. 'Misplaced Love' is the best on this album and is hard to find on CD - so worth getting for that song alone. , 3.0
 Solid recording from these TENOR TITANS. Real nice mix of tunes. The maturity and confidence of years of playing together really shine here in 1973. Jackie Byard George Duvivier and Mel Lewis are the crack rhythm section complimenting the Tenors. Rod McKuens' 'Jean' is a nice surprise with Zoot on Soprano Sax. Al tackles 'Body & Soul' alone and very nicely. 'Doodle' & 'Mama Flosie' really stand out. A well rounded set and highly recommended. , 5.0
 THese running board grips look nice. Installed on my 95 Arctic cat EXT. They look so nice. Instalation is a brezze too. Just clamp the surefoots in the place you want and drill the holes. Get your rivet gun out and snap they are done. Very very easy. Only thing is that if you need to cut to size you may have troubles cause the alluminum is rather thick. , 4.0

 This Reunion of two superstars is long overdue in CD form. Every one of the 24 songs is enjoyable. My own favorite is The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. I'm not a big country music fan but this album should appeal to a wide range of listeners. I've been a Jimmy Webb fan since his work with the 5th Dimension and Richard Harris. His writing is the best and Glen Campbell's voice has never sounded better. I ordered the CD based on the pre-release mention on the VH-1 special on Glen Campbell and have played it daily since it arrived. It's a real pleasure to hear this great work. , 5.0
 When we bemoan the awful disco of the 1970s we forget the creatuve force of writers like Jimmy Webb. His 'Reunion' album with Glen Campbell (in fine voice--light years from his insufferable 'Rhinestone Cowboy' days)--features excellent imagery-laden lyrics with heart-tugging melodies and gorgeous string arrangements that never seem smarmy. 'Wishing Now' 'It Must Be a Sin' and 'I Keep It Hid' are worth the whole price of admission. Even though some of the added material features non-Webb arrangements that pale in comparison (though Campbell meets the challenge of 'Highwayman') the whole thing reminds you of a time when genuine emotion still pervaded popular music. Some lovely stuff here. , 5.0
 Of all the great song writers whose work is best interpreted by someone else only the Byrds doing Bob Dylan can outdo Glen Campbell's covers of Jimmy Webb tunes.This CD is made up of the 1974 Campbell-Webb 'Reunion' album and fourteen 'bonus' tracks. (You get a lot for your money.)On a solid CD full of great music 'The Moon is a Harsh Mistress' stands out as the best as beautiful a song as any that Jimmy Webb has ever written and Glen Campbell's version sends shivers up the spine. 'The Moon is a Harsh Mistress' reminds me a lot of Gordon Lightfoot's 'The Last Time I Saw Her Face' (which Campbell has covered) and like the Lightfoot song the lyrics are stronger than the music.Another stand out track is 'Christiaan No' Webb's ode to his son (Campbell's Godson).This is one of those CDs that you can listen to from beginning to end without skipping a tune. Sitting back and enjoying music like this is one of life's great pleasures. , 5.0
 After years of waiting here is a well put together release featuring the entire 'Reunion' lp + other classic Glen/Jimmy Webb gems that are just now becoming available on CD for the first time and boy is it nice to hear these in the digital format. So clean sounding! This should hopefully make way for some more Glen albums to come out on CD. Lovely job on the liner notes too! , 5.0
 Finally the long awaited CD that all of us Glen Campbell/Jimmy Webb fans have been waiting for! This CD includes Glen's best album from the 70s 'Reunion' along with virturally all of his covers of Webb's later songs. A must have CD! , 5.0
 Say what you will about Glen Campbell the man has one heck of a voice. Although his material often borders on and on occasion crosses the 'corny' line. Not so in his collaborations with the great Jimmy Webb. For a more perfect marriage of songwriter and singer you'd have to go to Bacharach/Warwick or Carole King/Dusty Springfield.This album is a veritable treasure trove of some of the most beautiful yet obscure Jimmy Webb songs. Webb's lyrics have always astounded me - so much depth for such a young man(barely out of his teens at the time). Jimmy Webb wrote some of the most poignantly mature lyrics(and to an extent melodies)to ever be recorded in the 20th Century. There are songs on this album - 'The Moon's A Harsh Mistress' 'You Might As Well Smile' - which are so sophisticated yet heart rending that you just might find your eyes welling up.In the late 60's and early 70's Jimmy Webb had no real competition when it came to writing songs of lost love. And Glen Campbell's huge vocal range just serves the songwriter's intent like a hand in a glove. It's nothing short of a blessing that these 2 men worked together so well.If you purchase no other Jimmy Webb and/or Glen Campbell album you owe it to yourself to savor this musical feast. It's that good! But don't take my word for it - hearing is believing. , 5.0
 I have very little in my head from the 70's. But I had the cassette of this album and played it in a shoebox player until it broke. I probably have every song in my head still. I wish more singers would create cds of special writers songs like this. , 5.0

" Jimmy Webb is the quintessential great American poet and Glen Campbell is the only voice alive who knows Jimmy Webb's heart well enough to vocalize it this well! This is a beautiful album - every lyric and every note!! How's this for poetry? 'I remember times when you held me. You'd freeze my spine. We were lookin' in the mirror at the time; I got confused and I thought your eyes were mine...' GOOSEBUMPS I TELL YOU! In addition to the great songs from the original Reunion CD there are bonuses on this compilation like Still Within the Sound of My Voice and the ONLY VERSION of The Highwayman that is worth listening to is by Glen Campbell (I mean I like Willie and Johnny and Waylon as well as the next person but Glen just GETS IT you know?). Another favorite is Light Years...one man feels what he writes down to his very bones and the other one sings what he feels down to his soul...you simply cannot go wrong with this CD (program your player to skip the song In Cars...ENJOY ENJOY ENJOY And what ever you do - BUY THIS!!! ", 5.0
 This album remains has remained my all time favorite for 22 years.Glen Campbell sings Jimmy Webb like no other.While this CD offers extra's--the Reunion album is the first 10 songs-the songs are exquisite Campbell's singing delivery is clear and uneffectedwhile DELIVERING each and every song.Orchestration is seventiesstringsetc.--but it supports the songs.If only I had taken the trip to New York to see he and WEbb last year at FEINSTEIN's--I heard it was amazing. , 5.0
 If Reunion would have been a followup to Rhinestone Cowboy - it would have been one of the best of the 70s. Great material. , 5.0
 As someone who LOVES the music and heart of Jimmy Webb I was delighted with this album. All of the Reunion cuts are fabulous but I already had them. The song Lightening In A Bottle alone is worth buying the album. It is Jimmy Webb and Glen Campbell at their collective best. For Webbheads everywhere and Glen Campbell fans--you gotta have it! , 5.0

 This is the album that made me forget I only listened to rock. Before 'Reunion' I looked with disdain on anything that smacked of country music. I disliked country and disliked people who liked country music.Then with this record I realized that genius knows no boundaries. Jimmy Webb may be one of America's greatest contemporary composers and no one can deliver his compositions more elegantly than Glen Campbell.If you love melody if one of the things you love about music is that it can take you down to that place of reflection and remembrance if you understand the difference between sentiment and abject pain then you must listen and then listen again to this masterpiece of an album. , 5.0
 Beginning around 1967 songwriter Jimmy Webb and singer Glen Campbell were often mentioned in the same breath. That's because Campbell recorded so many Webb songs and had so many hits with them (including 'By the Time I Get To Phoenix' 'Galveston' 'Wichita Lineman' and 'Honey Come Back' as well as lesser-known songs such as 'Just Another Piece of Paper') and the match was perfect. While Webb's songs were also hits by the likes of The Fifth Dimension Art Garfunkel Richard Harris and the Brooklyn Bridge Campbell remained at the forefront of Webb interpreters. When the LP 'Reunion' was issued by Capitol Records in 1974 it was a godsend for Webb/Campbell fans. It contained eight Webb compositions plus one song each by Webb's sister Susan and a tune by Little Feat's Lowell George both superbly arranged by Webb. No hits came from the LP and to my knowledge no singles were issued. When the LP eventually went out of print those of us who loved it bemoaned its unavailability. But now Raven Records has reissued it on CD as 'Reunited' with FOURTEEN bonus tracks! These tracks are Webb songs that Campbell recorded here and there over the years for Capitol Atlantic and MCA Records and it's SO wonderful to have them all gathered together here. If all you know is Campbell's hit records and Webb's hit songs here's your chance to hear outstanding renditions of terrific songs. The beautiful timeless 'The Moon's A Harsh Mistress' is here along with such unheralded gems as 'Lightning In A Bottle' (one of Webb's best songs and one of Campbell's finest vocals) and 'If These Walls Could Speak.' Both Webb and Campbell were at the absolute top of their forms on the songs that make up this CD and Raven Records is to be commended for the reissue which includes an informative photo-laden booklet. Check out the samples offered by amazoncom then BUY THIS CD! You won't be sorry! , 5.0
 From the first tune the chills came back. And when Glen rips into the words early on in Just This One Time I was back to the old chair with the vinyl on the stereo. The tunes are a testament to Webb's remarkable writing and arranging talents. He puts himself up for all to see and speaks as if he has read my thoughts. Such a long lost treasure found again....thanks to the Aussies for put it all together! Now I must get back to listening...and smiling! , 5.0
 This CD elevates Glen Campbell's talent to heights that would surprise those of you who only know him by Rhinestone Cowboy and Southern Nights.This folk/pop/country/gospel collection rivals the finest works of James Taylor Art Garfunkel Jim Croce and well you name it.All the tracks from 1974's REUNION album are here which Rolling Stone magazine labeled Glen's finest album of the 1970's. Plus tracks which will knock your socks off including the wonderful homage song to a three year old son Christiaan No from 1976. Early Morning Song from 1977 which is eerie and charming at the same time. Highwayman from 1979 the song later made a big hit by Johnny Cash etc. which Glen helped on behind the scenes and proves the reincarnation theory. Even the song reincarnated itself to be a Grammy award winner in the 1980's!Lightning In A Bottle is gorgeous beautiful and a masterpiece and 1987's Still Within The Sound of My Voice picks up where Playground Susie ended 30 years prior. 24 tracks in total makes this an outstanding value and you will listen and listen again.Bottom line buy it this is a blue chip CD you want in your portfolio of music! , 5.0
 Okay put aside everything you know about 'Glen Campbell' (Tanya the born again stuff whatever....) and buy this astonishing CD. It's clear through this comprehensive release that Jimmy Webb is at the peak of America's songwriters in either the 20th or 21st century -- there's just something about a Webb song that digs so much deeper than anything anyone else writes and yet the songs remain fully based in the singable pop genre. And Campbell here knocks them all out of the ballpark. Among the many vast highlights are 'Still Within the Sound of My Voice' 'I Keep It Hid' and 'The Highwayman.' If you're in any way an admirer of the extensive songwriter/singer work between Webb and singers such as Art Garfunkel (the sensational 'Watermark' CD) and Linda Ronstadt (especially on 'Cry Like A Rainstorm') then this CD is an absolute must. In fact this has zoomed up into my top CDs of all time (and that company includes Jennifer Warnes' 'Famous Blue Raincoat' Joni Mitchell's 'Court and Spark' Mary Chapin Carpenter's 'Come On Come On' and Jane Olivor's 'First Night.') Highest recommendation! , 5.0
 The assiduous Glenn A Baker has again dug deep into the archives to unearth 14 bonus tracks to tack onto the superb'Reunion' album of Webb and Campbell from 1974. Liner notes speak of Campbell's 'raw impassioned quality' on those initial 30 minutes. With Webb more restrained at the keyboard the balance with the singer is just right. The album kicks off with a sensational reading of Lowell George's'Roll me Easy'. He could not have avoided hearing George's sumptuous swaggeringly sensual version doing the rounds at the time. Campbell triumphs however with a vigour I'd never heard from him until this moment. Until Webb's'Archives' was released(with the unavailability of his masterly'Land's End') it was difficult to access the superb'Just This One Time'. 'The Moon's A Harsh Mistress' is another achingly sweet work every bit as seductive as the better known version by Art Garfunkle. And'It's a Sin' is a scorching finale to the original set. The bonus stuff is not up to its meter.'Highwayman' and'Love Song' are both more convincing on Webb's CDs. Only'Light Years' and'If These Walls Could Speak' hint at the glory attained in the preceeding reunion. They are not poor pop or country by current standards. But they are not the high octane Campbell of this one outing which cut him from the plethora of competent cowboy singers of his day. , 5.0
 I can't express my gratitude at the reviews I've read enough - I remember finding 'Reunion' in the remainder bin at a Caldor's a couple of decades ago. I couldn't believe what I was listening to when I got it home. How could this album not be a top seller I thought? 'Wishing Now' is one of the most achingly joyous if that's the best way to put it songs of longing you'll ever hear. 'You Might As Well Smile' is a masterpiece of soulful humanity. 'The Moon's a Harsh Mistress' is pure poetry set to music. One of the GREAT albums of all time - period. , 5.0
 This disc proves that there's much more to the Campbell/Webb association than the 4 or 5 hits from the late 60s we all know and love. 'The Moon's A Harsh Mistress' 'Highwayman' 'Lightning in a Bottle' and 'If These Walls Could Speak' are particularly fine Webb songs and they're given superb renditions by Campbell. The chemistry has always been right between these two and I hope it's not the last we hear of them together. , 4.0
 This is the true story of a mother superior named Sister Benedetta Carlini and another nun from a small village near Florence in 17th century Italy who basically liked to rub bodies together in bed until they reached orgasm. This if course was a big no-no if you're a nun sworn to chastity. People found out and there was a trial in which the private sex life of these two nunnies was exposed. The scandal made them both lose their reputations. This is one of the earliest and most sensationalistic accounts of lesbian love on record. The fact that it was between two nuns makes it just that much more shocking and intriguing.(...) , 5.0

 Charlie Adams is one of those great artists who some how slipped through the cracks and never quite made it to the fame that he deserved! But thanks to Bear Family Charlie Adams is back in circulation with tunes like the title track 'Cattin' Around' which really bounces. Other uptempo western swing numbers like 'T.T. Boogie' 'Baby Let Me Kindle Your Flame' and 'I'm an Army Man' are balanced with down right honky tonk tunes that hit the mark that modern day country music can't even get close to. Songs like 'I'm A Railroad Daddy' and 'I'm Gonna Put My Foot Down' are the kind of songs that parallel Hank Williams Sr. in style. Mournful ballads and weepers round out the album's content with songs like 'My Blue Monday' and 'I'll Remember Your Love In My Prayers'. Two of the songs on this album could probably have been left off but they do speak of the era. I'm sure that had Charlie Adams known what we know now he probably would never have recorded 'Hey Liberace'. This novelty tune is even funnier knowing Librace's sexual preferences the lyrics are forgivable knowing the era that they were written and the song itself is a great arrangement. Pistol Packin' Mama is done very well too but it's just a song that's been done to death - again a reflection of the times. Over all - if your looking for how country music should really sound this is the disc for you! This is a disc that you'll have a hard time taking out of your player! , 4.0
 While the quality of the product is great like so many wash pants today there is no room at the waist for making adjustments. The rear seam is extremely tight and while it can be taken in with difficulty there is no room for letting out even 1/2 inch. Purchase a size above your waist size and unless you can do it yourself be prepared to pay for making these a good fit. Of course if you don't mind bunching at the waist you'll be OK. , 3.0

 Dockers are Dockers so that's not the problem. Just be sure you don't trust the images if you choose to buy these via Amazon. 'Cafe' for example should be 'Coffee.' Despite the fact that the image for 'Cafe' shows a stone or very light gray color 'Cafe' is actually dark brown. So the product isn't defective but IS misleading, 2.0
 To often I have made the mistake of ordering from unreliable clothing sellers but not here. These are real Dockers slacks with real quality. These run true to size and are excellent quality materials for a decent price. I like the pleated slacks myself because after hitting thirty plus most men have a little extra in the handle section. Pleats seem to disguise that nicely. I recommend these because Dockers are great slacks and wear well and these are true Dockers.CA Luster , 4.0

 I absolutely love these (white) Dockers pants! They go very well with both polo shirts and long-sleeve dress shirts and are made of very comfortable cotton. For summer wear you can get a casual yet very classy look if you pair them with a shirt from Van Heusen DKNY Pierre Cardin Geoffrey Beene Stafford or other such brand. The 'individual-fit' waistband automatically expands by one inch for added comfort. , 5.0

" I have worn these pants for years; my size is the same as always. I couldn't get them on; they were so tight I couldn't get the button buttoned around the waist. What is going on? These pants seemed to be cut for a skinny 25 year old not someone who is a little on the hefty side. Further the shipping and handling charges are just out of sight...$16.95 above and beyond the already rather pricy product. I would not recommend doing business with this seller at all. You can go to other outlets and get the same thing without the shipping and handling and there are 'deals' out there from major store chains. I was really disappointed in this product and the seller. Go to WalMart and get their khakis; they are very inexpensive and wear like iron. ", 2.0

 I ordered these slacks specifically because the description said they had a comfort-fit waistband. I am an ostomy patient and occasionally need that little extra inch the elastic expansion in the waistband gives you. Despite clearly stating that these pants had that comfort-fit waistband the pants I received did not have it. In all other regards these pants are perfectly fine They fit well and are in every other respect exactly what I expected.

 The Dockers 'individual fit' system works well in that one can get by without 'odd' waist sizes like 33 35 etc. by ordering even sizes and allowing the system to stretch a bit if it needs to. These pants are very durable and still look presentable after washing and machine drying. An ironing every so often would probably be useful for 'business casual'. A good value. , 5.0

 Ok so these are great pants. Come on guys. They are pleated.

 This recording of Parsifal is one of the best ever made. The sound is excellent and the Bavarian Radio Orchestra paced by Kubelik plays superbly! The singers are all excellent. James King in the title role does not have the vocal heft of a true heldentenor or 'tenore di forza.' So his potrayal is not in the mode of say Domingo Vickers or Thomas. Yet his contribution is quite poignant and heartfelt and so he makes the role credible. Just listen to his 'Amfortas! Die wunde!' in the second act and you'll know what I mean. Yvonne Minton does not have the powerful mezzo-soprano of some of her predecessors in the role of Kundry such as Dalis or Gorr. But she has a beatiful voice and compelling musicianship. Likewise Bernd Weikl and Matti Salminen as Amfortas and Titurel respectively are in fine vocal estate and make powerful contributions in their roles. The stand out performance however goes to Kurt Moll as Gurnemanz. I own five recordings of 'Parsifal' and do not believe there will ever be as great a Gurnemanz as Moll. As a German his diction is flawless. As are his line tone and the pathos depth and heartfelt characterization he brings to the role. Luxury casting has Lucia Popp as the first flowermaiden.The three best Parsifal recordings I have ever heard are, 5.0
 If you're tired of the 'who can conduct Parsifal most slowly' contest this is a wonderful recording. Makes the opera sound like a dramatic fifth opera of the Ring rather than a infinitely lugubrious funeral. Orchestral balance wonderfully modulated very very good cast. Highly recommended. , 4.0
 There are many very fine recordings of Parsifal in the catalog. In fact it's difficult to find a poor performance. The highlight of this production is the magisterial Gurnemanz of Kurt Moll--possibly the best rendition ever. He is ablely supported by the poet of the baton Rafael Kubelik and a virile James King as Parsifal also possibly his best recorded role ever. The recording has a wide and deep sound stage with excellent sonics. I enjoyed listening to this excellent studio rendition. Wagnerian singing of the highest standards.This recording is near the top of my favorite stereo studio editions along with Karajan's also fine rendition on DG recorded the same year as this one(1980). For the historically minded I would recommend Krauss's 1953 Bayreuth live air check or Knappertsbusch's 1951 Bayreuth live recording on Decca. Karajan's live Vienna aircheck from 1961 on RCA is also interesting but sounds older than the earlier recommendations. , 5.0

" Who are the great post-War Wagner conductors? Knappertsbusch? Krauss? Solti? Karajan (if that's your taste)? Barenboim? Goodall? For the connoisseurs perhaps there's Kempe and Keilberth. Maybe even Jochum. But the list seldom includes Kubelik. Yet on disc there's a wonderfully conducted Lohengrin let down by Gwyneth Jones on one of her squallier days but enhanced by a beautiful Elsa from Janowitz. There's what is probably the best all round Meistersinger on disc which is again wonderfully conducted. And there's this Parsifal.This is Wagner conducting of the first order on practically all counts. First orchestral balance. Kubelik is wonderfully sensitive to the combinations and colours of Wagner's score inspired by the unique acoustic the composer had created at Bayreuth. To take just the Prelude the balance between strings and clarinet followed by the addition of the cor anglais in the opening theme is judged to perfection. Then the repeat of the same theme on the trumpet over pulsing 3+2 chords in the upper woodwind and arpeggio strings cuts through just as it should. Come the development section the addition of Horn 1 to Horn 3 at the top of the arch of that same melody enriches the texture perfectly. And so it goes on right through the opera.Then the pacing. Overall Kubelik strikes a happy median between Knappertsbusch and Boulez. But he understand the ebb and flow of the piece so well the mastery of what Wagner called `the Art of Transition'. So the profounder moments in the Grail Castle have all the space and air they need while much of Act 2 is taken at an urgent exciting pace. Indeed unlike most conductors Kubelik seems to see the Second Act as the crux of the piece. (In this he goes along with Wieland Wagner whose graphic chart of the Parsifal Cross showing all the action radiating from the kiss is well worth investigating.) In retrospect the whole opera under Kubelik seems to be one great balanced arch with the Kiss as its keystone. And this is the most comprehensive and fulfilling performance of this Act that I know.Finally Kubelik really brings out the modernity of the piece to the full. Harmonically much of Parsifal and especially Act 3 mark a huge advance over anything in Tristan. And here you also have all those stark juxtapositions of the chromatic with the squarely diatonic (e.g. the Faith motif and the Dresden Amen theme). What I've never noticed before listening to this performance is how advanced it is rhythmically as well. So many of those chromatic themes and motifs involve syncopations and tied notes across bar-lines that totally do away with the tyranny of the bar. It is often as hard to tell where you are rhythmically as it is harmonically. Which of course is exactly what Wagner intendedThe singers it has to be said are not quite in the same league as their conductor. The outstanding performance here is Yvonne Minton's Kundry. One of the best `Ich sah das Kinds' I know; a very sexy seductive lead into the kiss; true tragic angst as she recalls laughing at Christ; hair-raising and scary when she starts threatening. Her intonation is also wonderfully exact in all those creepy chromatic phrases slipping up or down by semitone steps. Moll's performance is streets ahead of what he gave under Levine's lethargic direction but he still can't quite stop Gurnemanz turning into a bit of a bore with his Act 1 narration in a way that a Weber or a Hotter always avoided. King is a sound Parsifal (as he is for Boulez) while never raising the hairs on the back of your neck as Vickers could at points like `Amfortas! Die Wunde!'. Weikl is good but not great. Mazura sings Klingsor's part most musically (no barking) but only Hermann Uhde seemed able to turn the character into something more than a pantomime villain. Salminen's Titurel is impressive but unremittingly forte. The Flowermaidens can be a bit shrill with the exception of the lovely Lucia Popp.The sound (from a Bavarian Radio recording of 1980) is not top flight by today's highest standards but more than good enough to hear all of Kubelik's mastery of this score. And make no mistake. This is masterly conducting well worth hearing. ", 5.0
" Raphael Kubelik conducts a first-rate cast and orchestra in a performance of Parsifal that is at once profoundly satisfying both emotionally and intellectually. The orchestral playing is wonderfully clear and precise and at the same time rich and deep in sound. The singers have clearly lived into their roles even though this is not a recording of a staged performance. I suspect that the members of this cast have sung these roles together on stage; they come across as a seasoned ensemble used to working together. Some critics have found James King a bit ragged in the final act but I cannot hear this; I hear only the voice of an empathic artist portraying a man undergoing radical and painful transformation. Parsifal's healing hurts.Why is this recording not released until 2003 (a shame in itself) already out of print or at least not easily available in the United States???? Perhaps Audite the in-house label of the Bavarian State Radio Orchestra will pick it up and include it in their ongoing release of masterful performances under Kubelik's baton. ", 5.0
 I'm very picky about Wagner recordings and if the ensemble as a whole doesn't work for me I usually can never give it the stars it deserves. Kubelik's Parsifal though deserves all the stars amazon.com can offer. Albeit the fact that this recording was vaulted due to the popularity of the deservedly famous Karajan Berlin set I cannot stop praising the several merits of this recording. First and foremost the soloists in this recording are simply outstanding. At his age James King sings an excellently vocalized and dramatically right Parsifal. The voice may not have the bloom of youth possessed by Jess Thomas or Peter Hofmann but it truly is a golden voice. Kurt Moll is the best Gurnemanz of the discography and this is his best performance of the role. He surpasses his Gurnemanz under Levine and slightly that of Karajan's. He uses his ability as a lieder singer to highlight the emotional moments that make this role so distinct that I couldn't help but feel moved by this benchmark performance. Yvonne Minton sings the most wonderful Kundry in the discography and I find that I have never heard a better mezzo soprano act out the role better than her or Christa Ludwig. The dementia and seductiveness is all there and that soft moan at the beginning of act 3 is to die for. Bernd Weikl sings a typical Amfortas although he does outshine many other singers in the discography save Jose Van Dam in the Karajan recording. The highlight of this recording though is Rafael Kubelik's transparent and emotionally saturated conducting of Wagner's score. I think that after Karajan's set this is the Parsifal to own. Highly recommended. , 5.0
" I thought that the Karajan was unbeatable until I discovered this recording long held in the DG vaults for reasons of petty jealousies and politicking. It is superior to every other account by virtue of Kubelik's masterly pacing; he achieves both a spiritual dimension somewhat beyond (what now seems like) the merely polished achievement of Karajan. Kurt Moll possessed surely the most beautiful post-war Wagnerian bass and he is caught here in his absolute prime; there is more nuance more resonance and more drama than in his slightly later assumption of the role with Karajan. The orchestra are superb and although other reviewers have found the sound wanting I do not; it seems to me incomparably clear and spacious. Again some reviewers have found fault with the singing; I find that Minton's Kundry one or two strained top notes apart achieves the perfect balance between vulnerability and animal passion. King achieves the miracle of making believable Parsifal's transition from boyish oaf to a hero enlightened by compassion; he is very careful in how he enunciates and inflects the text and sings both softly and heroically. Frank Mazura's Klingsor sounds uncannily like Gustav Neidlinger's Alberich in the famous Solti 'Ring' - and that is meant to be a high compliment. The Flower maidens headed by Lucia Popp are a seductive bunch; perhaps the only slight disappointment comes from Weikl's rather exterior Amfortas but his was a fine voice at that time - not too much of the bleat which now intrudes - and he makes a fine job of the three climactic utterances of 'Erbarmen' in his big aria. I stll miss the sheer beauty of Van Dam in Karajan's set or perhaps the heft of London - a different approach from Van Dam's inward lyrical interpretation but mightily impressive nonetheless - but as a whole this recording is by far the most moving authoritative and absorbing of this towering masterpiece.

 I had decided not to review my favorite studio recording of Parsifal because so many others had already said most of what I had to say. But after listening to the 2nd Act on my lunch hour today I find I need to blow off some happy steam and share a few thoughts.Much for the same reason as Kubelik's 'Meistersinger' was supressed to clear the market for Karajan's inferior recording this Parsifal languished in the vault for more than twenty years. It is a great pity and shame that one conductor can wield that much power to the detrement of his collegues and the loss of the opera-loving public.Rafael Kubelik's flawlessly proportioned profoundly felt reading of this most ephemeral of Wagner's operas equals the best of Knapperstbusch's live Bayreuth performances with all the advantages of a studio recording, 5.0
 Probably the finest Parsifal on CD and certainly the best sung. The late great James King pours out streams of magnificent impassioned tone. (It's beyond me why so many reviewers think we need to turn to the relatively pinched monotonous and unidiomatic Domingo for beautiful Wagner singing. Nein danke.) Kurt Moll is everything he's cracked up to be and Kubelik conducts as authoritatively as in his Meistersinger (also probably the best available recording rivalled only by Kempe). The clincher is Bernd Weikl a ringing virile baritone a fine actor and easily the greatest Amfortas I've heard. Compare the critics' favorites in the role Fischer-Dieskau and Van Dam and you'll find their top notes painful in way that can't really blamed on the character's wound. (Let's hope it's not long before a DVD release of the Bayreuth video with Weikl and the young Siegfried Jerusalem Horst Stein conducting.) A quibble, 5.0
 While everyone has their favorite studio recording of Wagner's final masterpiece this one sung by Wagnerian tenor James King is one of the finest ever sung. Today Parsifal has been interpreted in an entirely different way. Placido Domingo debuted at Bayreuth as Parsifal and sings it in a more lyrical relaxed but dynamic manner. Rene Kollo has a similar lyric style. Jon Vickers sang the role on stage and used bravado. James King with enough experience singing Wagner behind him sings Parsifal in this 1982 recording which is actually the soundtrack to the controversial and post-modern German film. James King though in his old age sings with enough strength and character vitality that we are wholly convinced he is the foolish knight who journeys from innocence to maturity and spiritual enlightenment. Though troubled by his unknown past tempted by Kundry and the Flower Maidens quite possibly has some Freudian/Oedipal love for his mother he proves to be the one knight the 'Chosen One' who can save the cursed land of the Grail and restore peace and heal the wound of the dying Amfortas. The Holy Grail looms large over the story. It brings redemption through compassion. It is ultimately Kundry who is healed and transformed from wild outcast (she mocked Christ on the Cross) to a woman so possessed by the spiritual power of God and Christ's love that she faints in the final scene. Kundry is another voice-killer for sopranos or mezzo sopranos who sing her. Time and again dramatic mezzos have fared better in the role. Yvonne Minton was perhaps the only mezzo soprano after Christa Ludwig who sings Kundry with enough pathos and power to make her compelling and dramatically appealing. Minton has a voice that is both beautiful and on hte edge. Hers is my favorite Kundry. Her vocal duets/scenes with King are sensational. Kubelik conducts with enough attention to subtleties and color that this is most likely the most lush and expressive Parsifal ever made. It is not religiously bombastic as Karajan's edition. Many still find Knapperbutsch's recording the best but Kubelik had a mystical approach to the work that is unlike anything I've ever heard. , 5.0
 This is a superlative recording and I dare say this is the one that takes first prize. I have 8 other recordings of Parsifal (Goodall Jordan Kegel Knappertsbuschx2 Krauss Stein and von Karajan). While I find von Karajan's conducting and the BPO/Chorus to be sheer unsurpassed beauty von Karajan's Parsifal (Hofmann) is the worst I have ever heard (it's shocking how such a thing could have been permitted to mar such a beautiful recording!!). Both Kubelik and von Karajan produced STUNNING stereo studio recordings and have the best Gournemantz in my opinion, 5.0
 This Parsifal is the second best stereo Parsifal on disc tied with Solti's lesser only to Kna's transcendent 62 philips with Hotter London Thomas etc. Among more modern versions it outranks Barenboim and Karajan. The cast is sensational.Kurt Moll turns in his finest Gurnemanz with a voice in much better form than for either Levine(CD\DVD). Weikl as Amfortas(of course) perrforms at his usual excellent standard. Salminen is the perfect Titurael and Franz Mazura is tremendously better than his later performance on the Levine DVD. James King is a very good Parsifal one of the best on disc-though here I do prefer Siegfried Jerusalem only on the Barenboim recording.Despite such a stellar cast the real star of the show is Kubelik. Wagnerites already know this from his Meistersinger(also the best modern version-if not the best overall) and his Lohengrin on DG.His reading is very unique and tender but never sacrifices any of the natural flow that Levine does-his reading is one of the most profound on disc made immediately apparent even from the opening Prelude when each tutti is done with the utmost clarity and refinement-really I have never heard a finer or more careful(in a good way) job by a conductor with the exception of KNA. For those who love Parsifal like myself you must get this. It is absolutely a must as essential as the KNA. I have to admit the KNA is still my favourite-but this really allowed me to hear this work in a fresh beautiful way that I hadnt done in a long while.Gurnemanz is one of if not my favourite Wagner character. I consider the finest to be Hotter and Griendl with Frick for Solti coming in a close second followed by this performance by Moll to be a third(again I must emphasize THIS performance not the Levine when his voice is lighter and more strained at times. As Amfortas I consider Londons 62 to be the most convincingly tender suffering and angelic performance ever-just listen to his intro when he sings about the grace of the morning) along with Hotter and Thomas Hampson-James King does a fine job as Parsifal-though at times I found him to be at times and only briefly a little kitschy. I adore Jerusalems Barenboim account. Here Yvonne Minton turns in a fine kundry though Waltrued Meier takes the cake-again with Barenboim and Nagano. Niedlinger has always been my favourite Klingsor especially the 54 KNA along with Roar from the Stein DVD. Hotter with Solti and this Salminen interp have been my favoutite Titurels.If you buy only one parsifal buy the Philips KNA(62). If you are going to be two then buy this one along with that. I also strongly recommend finding a performance of KNA\54 with Josef Griendl as Gurnemanz. My DVD preferences include the Horst Stein for tradionalists and the Kent Nagano for those seeking new ways to see Wagner.Buy it before it disappears into the ivory tower in the desert never to be heard from again. It already happened once. , 5.0

The hat was completely flattened leaving two huge creases on either side of the logo. Ruined hat if you ask me and will be returning immediately.

 Even that single star is more than this book is worth. My Engligh professor assigned this book to me during my sophomore year of college (along with Nectar in a Sieve a far better though not terrific book) and what little I remember of it was that it was just awful (and offal). Her writing is repetitive and choppy perhaps descriptive but disgustingly so. Do we really need to know the 'wetness between [her] legs' or that she cooked her menstrual fluid into some poor soul's dinner? I couldn't stand the book. If you want quality read something by Neil Gaiman or Stephen King (his descriptions of a girl coming of age in Carrie are much better than this book). Drop the book throw it burn it whatever. It's just not worth reading. How many trees did we lose to its production (and more importantly how many talented young writers were rejected because this woman was published).

 But not as good as Slo Burn or Unida (John Garcia's current band.) The music is pretty boring and the vocals are the only thing that redeems this album.

 The book itself is incredible and has changed the way I think. However it's heavy reading and a bit dated so many time I'll have to read through a paragraph multiple times in order to get the intended meaning of it.

 Why buy a boring new appliance or an electronic gadget with $45.00 when you can get a sanded piece of wood with six precise cuts on the surface and connectors cut into the ends? Well I can tell you that this is one of the greatest enhancements one can make to a wooden train set. It's great to be able to have two long straight tracks side by side and then suddenly be able to cross from one track over to the other. My kids love their wooden train set and I gave them one of these and they were very happy to incorporate it into their track setup.And it really really works! You let a train go straight or push it to the right in either direction. No moving parts to fail or wear out.Seriously this is a fun little enhancement for a wooden train set and not the easiest one to find stand-alone outside a set but please do yourself a favor and shop around for different prices and manufacturers. , 5.0

 This is a book I recall reading as a school girl about another girl in far away Poland who aspired to study at University in Paris. Note worthy is that the book written by Eve Curie as a biography of her extaordinary physicist mother Madame Marie Curie received the 1937 World Book award for fiction. In the fashion of a romance novel Eve Curie recounts the story of Madam Curie's birth in Warsaw in 1867 and childhood in a Poland oppressed by Russia. She is depicted as a child driven intellectually and encouraged by a scholarly father. Madame achieved her aspiration of study in Paris where she collaberated with her physicist husband Pierre to isolate the element of radium. Detailed accounts depict family life in late 19th century Poland and her education and work in Paris until her death from radiation poisoning in 1934. , 4.0
 I loved this book. Written by one of the daughters of Marie Curie it is as close to the woman-genius as we'll ever get. Even if you aren't interested in science or chemistry (as I am not!) this is a wonderful book written in a way that lets you get to know Madame Curie without the interference of personal trivia or 'Mommie Dearest'-isms on the part of the daughter.

 Marie Curie was determined to get an education in the field of science and to work in an area of science that would fulfill her spirit of curiosity and intellectual honesty. The story of her journey begins with her girlhood in Poland where she was obliged to work as a governess to help send an older sister to college before it was socially appropriate for her to go. Once in college in Paris she endured numerous and serious challenges. Her will to prevail and her courage in the face of great adversity makes this biography a compelling story of dealing with problems upon problems but never losing sight of the goal never giving up never being less than you know you can be. I found it inspiring. , 5.0
 Marie Curie was a remarkable person in many respects. Back when few women were scientists she won the Nobel prize in both chemistry and physics. As a native Pole living in the oppressive Russian Empire she and other Polish students were only able to study their native language in secret. Fortunately she was able to complete her education and training in France. This biography written by her daughter is full of love and admiration for her remarkable mother. It is amazing to think that Marie Curie had to first learn how to separate the radioactive element Radium from its native ore in order to study its radioactive properties--hence the reason why she won the Nobel prize in chemistry as well as in physics. In those days scientists had to develop so much more of their techniques and equipment by hand and did not have all the grad students and assistants that prominent scientists have today. Marie Curie did so much of this work with dangerous radioactive material that she eventually died from exposure to radiation. She named the radioactive element Polonium in honor of her native country--noting that 'Polon' is the name for Poland in French.I actually read this biography in French when I was a high school student over 40 years ago. I had an excellent French teacher who loaned me the book because she knew that I was interested in pursuing a career in science.

 This book was a really great read. It was relatively easy to read and I would recommend that ages thirteen and up could easily get through it. This tells the story or a remarkable woman who through the struggles of poverty becomes an acclaimed world renowned scientist and a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize award. Born in Poland she has a very tough childhood and adolescence in which both her oldest sister and mother die. Her father M. Sklodovski is left alone to raise her and her three siblings. She endures a privileged schooling opportunity despite living in late nineteenth century Poland which has been put under the strict rule of the Russians. She works had for years to pay for her and her sister Bronya's education. Finally her hard work pays off and she leaves for France to become a student and being the remarkable young woman she was she succeeded immensely. Although she must live in poverty these early years and only allows herself to eat some bread cherries and maybe a few polish sausages she is able to pass the exams and begin to research and experiment in the laboratory. As she moves through stages of her life getting married having children and finally completely devoting her life to science when she discovers radium she becomes the outstanding scientist she is known for today. Her and her husband Pierre and daughter Irene all make contributions to science and receive many awards for doing so.

 The book is a reprint of the biography written by Marie Curie's daughter Eve Curie in 1937. It is a book which should be read by all - especially aspiring scientists. Marie Curie was the first woman to receive a Ph.D. in France the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize and the first person to receive two Nobel prizes. The work she accomplished under the most difficult situations for a scientist is truly inspiring. When asked why she and her husband Pierre Curie did not patent the procedure for extraction and purification of radium something which would have made them very wealthy she said 'No It would be contrary to the scientific spirit.' How refreshing since in today's world the first thought of scientists is patenting their discoveries. , 5.0

 In this Biography I was very pleased and liked the way the author expressed how Madame Curie was going through difficult times and overcame them. It was inspirational and gave me the yearning to do something magnificent. While reading this book I thought it was somewhat dull at first but then became very interested and wanted to read more. This book is one that will make you want to be the best you can be. It opened my eyes and made me realize that anything is possible. It gave me a new understanding and taught me a lot pertaining to the subject of science. I never really was a fan of reading science books but when I started to read this book I became surprised as to how much I really enjoyed it. The author did a great job with the journal entries and I believe that added a special touch to the biography.

" As a mother of three young children estranged from my husband in the 80's confronted with powerful emotions of attraction for a young woman I connected with the torment of Chase Phillips. I note that she was referred to as psychologically troubled but to be honest when faced with such an attraction that society has labelled as a 'sickness' does one wonder why. However do we not realize that if allowed to be true to one's nature it would not be psychologically troubling at all but rather liberating. Thank you for an incredible story one I was thrilled to claim as my own. I thank the universe for the courage to be true to my nature and the life that courage has allowed me to live. Thankfully I did not have to sacrifice my mental health or my children; but have enjoyed a rich relationship with all for the past 12 years.

I was asking myself why Sedgwick would want to take on such a challenging task of taking care of a woman in her condition when she had already had to deal with it in her own family. However the movie gelled for me when she faced off with Mirren in the pouring rain in such a tormented state trying to find answers to her past. This not only was a healing moment for Elizabeth but a turning point for Chase as well. This movie showed the depth of a woman who went along and played by all the rules until it proved too much. I was a little sad at the end when Chase's husband left and found another woman yet Elizabeth did not stay. But the title does sort of give it away. You felt good though knowing she had a new direction in life and a better understanding of herself. , 5.0
 Just fantastic! A really human look at despair and life's frustrations when dealing with depression and how love conquers all. This is a romantic love story - granted between two women - but a love story nonetheless. It also deals with the understanding of children and husbands in situations where love becomes the best medicine. Again - I loved this film and the character development. The film for a debut of Kevin Bacon's directing capabilities is a real find! , 4.0
 While the first half feels predictable and very TV movie theperformances are good enough (especially Helen Mirren) to keep itgoing.And in the second half this tale of a collage student mother's helperhired to help a woman in an angry depression after suffering a nervousbreakdown gets more complex and unpredictable.The relationship between the two women and they way their damagedsouls play off each other is quite moving and grown up.Strong subtle direction by Kevin Bacon.Does take a hit for over the top performances from the kids and otherkey small roles all playing types not human beings. , 4.0
 Picked one of these up the other day mostly for the slick design and for the wireless keyboard with trackball type mouse controller. But that's all it has is looks...After using the keyboard it quickly became tedious to use since not only are the keys hard to push down they are in a tight proximity of each other and not in the usual places and the wireless is hit and miss possibly because it runs at only 49MHz frequency. It will miss keys here and there so you have to type very slooow and check your work very often and with passwords where you can't see what you are typing good luck! It quickly becomes a tire... There is no number pad and the trackball mouse is skippy and lacks a scroll feature...The processor is 2 'generations' older than the current dual core intel processors and the RAM is standard DDR instead of DDR2...Unless HP updates the components and the keyboard this is a terrible value and a POS. , 1.0
 Great book! Easy lovely read starts a little slow i thought but its worth sticking around , 4.0
 I was absolutely hooked from the first chapter. I devoured the book. It's the fastest I've ever finished a book as I tend to have ADD and take longer than 2 weeks go finish even a great novel. This book was so fun to read. And interesting and emotional. I really connected with the characters. It's not so detailed that the book becomes long draggy and uninteresting. It stays young fun and fresh from page 1 through the end. There were times at the end of most sections the author would absolutely leave me at the edge of my seat yearning for more info. Highly recommended. Love Madeleine's style! , 5.0
 I downloaded the sample and could barely get though the first chapter. The authors writing felt very juvenile and kept mixing American with London slang. Honestly it was the dumbest book I've tried to read in a long time. At least download the sample first. , 2.0

 Sophie Kinsella is my favorite autor butI had no idea that Sophie Kinsella was not the real name of Madeleine Wickham. So imagine my surprise while I was browing the book section at a store and saw 'Cocktails for three' with the words 'Author of the Shopaholic series as Sophie Kinsella' on the cover. I immediately picked up the book and I was not dissapointed in the least. I loved the book. Maggie Candice and Roxanne make up the Cocktail Club. The three of the meet every first of every month at a bar for a night and bond. They all seem to be living happy lives but each life is not what it seems. What happens in each woman's life is fascinating and makes it hard to put this book down.I'm so happy to have found this book and now I'm looking for all the other books written by Madeleine Wickham. So if you're a big fan of the Sophie Kinsella novels and are looking for a little fix while we wait for the next Sophie Kinsella book 'Cocktails for three' is what you're looking for. , 5.0

 I'm a big fan of Sohie Kinsella's I consider her one of my favorite writers and I was so excited when I found this book. I was not let down It may not be something I read again like I do Kinsella books but few are. I loved it it is chick lit and as in most cases is sometimes predictable but I don't care I still fully enjoyed this. , 5.0
 Three friends share a monthly ritual of meeting for cocktails. Each of the women Maggie Roxanne and Candice has her own trauma to deal with one that threatens to topple her into an abyss of despair. Maggie is coping with new motherhood and the associated depressing parts of it. Roxanne is the other woman for a married man and Candice is paying for her father's mistakes perhaps more than she bargained on doing. It only takes one malicious interloper to almost wreck the three's friendship and Candice's life but when the women remember their friendship nothing can stop them.*** Although the ending is almost too good to be true the power of friendship is something that shines through clearly. Candice's story tends to be the dominant one and is interesting enough to fill an entire book but without Maggie and Roxanne's to be supportive it would founder. ***Amanda Killgore , 3.0
 I would have given this 4 stars had it not been for one irksome character by the name of Candice. It was just too far fetched for me how could a person be so naive to an outsider and yet hold down a job as a prolific writer in a popular magazine?!!! This sub-plot simply jars the whole story.Apart from Candice Maggie & Roxanne form the more believable duo of the trio of girlfriends cum colleagues who meet for cocktails once a month. Maggie's account of coping with motherhood is very intense and moving. Roxanne's affair with a much older married man is very much a dead end and quite cliched.All in all a readable story about the bonds of friendship and how misunderstandings can be overcome. , 3.0
 I have not read anything by Sophie Kinsella that I don't like and Cocktails for Three is no exception.Cocktails for Three written by Kinsella under the name Madeline Wickham is the story of three friends who have been meeting for years at their favorite watering hole The Manhattan Bar. Just as the Manhattan Bar has changed over the years so are the lives and circumstances of three friends Candice Maggie and Roxanne.I wanted to be a part of the friendship that these three girls shared and that to me is the work of an outstanding author. Madeline Wickham draws you into the characters lives so well that you want to be there and you are rooting for all three women and the special friendship they share.The friendship is tested in this story as Maggie is pregnant and faces her doubts and fears about her marriage her job and the new baby. Roxanne has a married lover and her relationship with her married lover is headed for some drastic changes and loss. Candice befriends and promotes a new girl and brings her into the circle of three friendsI just loved this story. Sophie Kinsella is just a master story teller. You will be drawn into this tale of friendship and love between three young women whose lives change and grow in this wonderful story. , 5.0
 I love all of Sophie Kinsella's books and her writing style...but this book was awful. The story line was predictable and the writing flat and unoriginal. Makes you wonder if this was truly written by Kinsella or a way for a ghost writer to get started under her 'new' pen name. I don't plan on buying anymore Madeline Wickham books--stick to the original Kinsella where I haven't been disappointed yet. , 2.0
 I have read all of the books written by 'Sophie Kinsella' and absolutely love them. This one was hard for me to get into. I didn't feel that connection to any of the three main characters like I have with characters in her other books. I usually end each book wanting more of the main characters but this one didn't leave that impression. All in all it was a good read just not my favorite. , 3.0
 I hadn't read any of Sophie Kinsella's books written under the Wickham name before and I did enjoy this quite a bit. Some of my perceptions changed as the story went on. I had misjudged two (perhaps three) characters but I came to see that they weren't as bad as I had thought.First of all I thought Giles was a selfish jerk. However he & Maggie had a communication problem. She also seemed to have something of a martyr complex not asking for nor accepting help and misunderstanding her mother-in-law's innocent actions for a long time. Finally she spoke up and shared her fears and concerns to learn that Giles was more of a 'new man' than she had thought and that Paddy was 'a star.' HOWEVER I must say that I'm aghast that she was so cavalier about preparing for childbirth/motherhood. She & Giles should have been at the classes no matter what he said. More than that however I cannot believe that she drank during her pregnancy and afterwards while she was nursing Lucia. Didn't she know that that could have had dire effect on her child (surely she has heard of fetal alcohol syndrome!). I am surprised at her parents. A first possibly an only grandchild deserved a little time off work to enjoy the little one. I know I would have done so.Roxanne reminds me of the song Saving All My Love for You. She had sacrificed six years of her life for a man who would never leave his wife until her childbearing years had virtually ended. But at least she did learn that he really loved her with the legacy he bequeathed to her and with his desire to spare her the pain of watching him die. But perhaps she can have the life she deserves on Cyprus with Nico.Candice had a full-blown martyr complex which allowed the psychopathic Heather to take over her life with the full intention of destroying her for her father's sins. I take a little issue with her attitude toward Ed at first. She was definitely holier than thou with him. And her attitude toward her mother wasn't much better. Didn't she realize how much her mother must have suffered? She deserved a little understanding from her daughter. I must say though she was right about Justin!As I said it was a quick read but it lacked the humor and whimsy of the Shopaholic books and Housekeeper. , 4.0

These women have maintained a 'life-line' friendship that is celebrated with cocktails at a favorite club once a month. As their lives begin to evolve the importance of their friends to sustain them comes into question. Through new babies lost love betrayal and making amends this story will weave its way into your heart and make you think about friendship in a more heartfelt way. , 4.0
 I was so disappointed with this book! I'm a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella's books under the name SK and have read all of them many times but this was the first book I'd read written under her name Madeleine Wickham. I thought the story was incredibly boring. There is no humor and no one is remotely witty! The characters were all one-dimensional and not lovable at all like her other female heroines. Nothing happened and the pace was unbearably slow. I plan to read other books under the name Madeleine Wickham because the woman herself is a fabulous writer but I didn't see her regular spark in Cocktails for Three at all. , 2.0

 Another great Sophie Kinsella book. One that I am sure many of us can relate to in one way or another as her main characters are as usual just like ourselves or someone we know. I must admit to reading this book in one day as I just couldn't put it down which is no mean feat as I had 4 children at home with me. Kids hubby house and animals generally get ignored when Sophie has a new book out. Read it I can guarantee you will love it. , 5.0

 This book was ok but not anywhere near the league of a Rosamunde Pilcher book. But since I have read all of Pilcher's books multiple times and wanted something new to read I tried this. The plot was nicely developed but Wickham pretty much tells you everything that is going to happen right up front thus taking away any delicious suspense. The writing is easy to read but lacks the coziness of Pilcher's books. , 3.0

 I've read Wickham's books under Sophie Kinsella and loved most of them but this was my first novel under her own name and I must say it was fantastic. Is it just me or can you sense a major difference in writing styles between Wickham and her alter ego Kinsella? Not that I mind at all because both makes for great reads. I loved the characters in this book and the twist at the end while somewhat predictable as you approach is still a lot of fun.Recommend this for a vacation or nightly read. It's quick easy to relate to the characters and fun. , 5.0

 While this will never win a Nobel prize in literature it does score high in the winners in Chick Lit category. With her unique winning style of making even mundane characters enjoyable Madeline Wickham/Sophie Kinsella hit a homeroom with this one. Sure Roxanne is predictable as the long term mistress of a married with kids guy. And anyone who's ever given birth will understand Maggie. Candice is a bit different trying to undo her father's errors which leads to her own undoing. So nothing unusual here. But what gives it five stars is the author's unique ability to create a witty breezy story that's fun to read even if you almost could have written the final chapter yourself. I'm always happy to find a new book by this multi-named gem and this is certainly one of her best under either aliases. , 5.0
 The friendship and hardships were so true to life that I felt myself tearing up more than once. I identified with all 3 girls. Yes it was a little predictable (I mean we all knew what Heather was going to do when she asked Candice what was most important to her) but the solutions and outcomes were witty and uplifting.The story really sucked me in and I can't wait to get copies for all my friends. Thank you for such a wonderful book Madeleine! , 5.0
 I was delighted to discover that Madeleine Wickham was the actual name of one of my favorite authors Sophie Kinsella. I could not believe that I was unaware that Sophie was a pen name.'Cocktails for Three' was the first book I read under Sophie's actual name. It is a wonderful beach/summer read. It is light and fun. The plot was somewhat predictable which is why I rated it four stars. She also uses the 'f' word a lot which is unlike her alter ego Sophie. The book however was a page turner. While the plot was predictable I found myself unable to put the book down. It contained humerous moments and geniune characters. I fell in love with Maggie - the woman who struggles with motherhood. The friendship of the protagonists leaped off the pages of the book which is what kept me interested in the story.I did agree with another reviewer in regards to Candice. Her character is loveable but it is hard to believe someone could be so gullible. Keeping all the above critcism in mind the book is certainly worth reading. Madeleine is a wonderful author! She knows how to keep a reader interested. And even though she is not as sophisticated of a writer as many classic authors she does possess the sharp satire of Jane Austen. I will certainly be investing in more Madeleine Wickham books. , 4.0
 This is the story of three professional women who work in London and meet once a month for cocktails and a bitch-and-moan session. You'd think they'd tell each other *everything* but each woman has a secret -- one is ashamed of a family secret one is in a long term relationship with a married man and one exudes confidence and strength even though she's filled with doubts about her decision to quit her job and stay home with her impending child. If it sounds like a trite and predictable plot that's when you must consider the talents of the author. Wickham is an extraordinary storyteller. Her dialogue is effortless and her characters more interesting than the total populations of ten romance novels. I pick up a Wickham novel (or other works under the name Sophie Kinsella) when I want a fun easy read --and I don't mean that pejoratively. Wickham's prose flows delightfully and pages are turned and time flows in reading bliss. I enjoyed each moment with these flawed but genuine women and their acquaintances. Plus there are ALWAYS moments when I guffaw out loud at some utterance or situation. Very enjoyable reading.If you're familiar with Wickham/Kinsella you won't be disappointed. If you're new to her it's definitely worth your time to give her a try. , 5.0
 After several girlfriends let me in on the fact that one of my favorite authors (Sophie Kinsella) was actually a pen name for Madeleine Wickham and that Madeleine had various novels published I was eager to read them! Cocktails for three is the first of Madeleine's novels that I've read and I devoured it wholeheartedly.Cocktails for Three follows the lives of three women who work together and are friends. Outside of work they meet up once a month at the Manhattan bar to catch up with one another and take some girl time together. The heroines' stories unfold after the first such meeting and the reader finds out that Maggie is due to have a baby at any moment Candice is about to run into a ghost from her family's sordid past and Roxanne is in a mysterious relationship with a married man. Throughout the course of the book the womens' lives are turned upside down and their friendships are tested. I truly enjoyed this book and the dynamics between the women. I also liked the fact that there were some unexpected plot twists which can be rare in typical chick lit books. This novel is jolly good fun and I loved it so much that I've already started reading another Wickham book the Gatecrasher. , 4.0
 I was happy with this book until the very end then I though it wrapped up far too neatly. The struggles and turmoil that took center stage throughout most of the book just dissipated leaving me with that empty feeling you get when a sitcom wraps up everything in the last two minutes. Such pain was taken to write very real very raw and very good scenarios for the main characters (most specifically Maggie) and then to have it all rainbows and kittens at the end was very disappointing. Sure there was tragedy along the way. There were some surprises and a lot of heartache. But at the end when it all seemed to be swept away it felt as though it had never happened. I lost touch with the characters I felt I had grown to know over the course of the book.I suppose people do like resolution and happy (ish) endings but for me the book would have been far better leaving some ends dangling some 'what ifs' for the reader to fill in. At least some lingering bit of doubt and questions! But the last chapter read like an epilogue laying out everything for you on a silver platter.I'm torn on giving this book three or four stars - it's really three and a half. I can see where a lot of people would very much enjoy it and not be as put off by the ending as I was. I can also see where some of the characters (specifically Candice) could be quite annoying. I think it would be a very good book to read and talk about as a character study for a group but not as great as a Sunday afternoon pleasure read. It's a book that pulls you along (it grabbed me from the beginning) but leaves you strangely unsatisfied. In the end I think it's an average book and I'll give it three stars. , 3.0
 You can count me in for a night out at the Manhattan Bar Along with Roxanne Candice and Maggie. These three friends meet once a month to catch up and just be together.This story by Wickham will take you through the pregnancy and upcoming new role as a mother for Maggie. It is easy to identify with her fears of motherhood.Candice who can't say no to anyone and how a secret from her past almost ruins her future...Roxanne who has been dating a secret married man for 6 yrs even her two best friends don't know his identity.This book takes you on the journey of friendship and self discovery.. I am sure that you will be able to relate to one or all of the characters in some way.This is a fun read.... , 4.0
 I didn't realize until I picked up this title at my local Borders that Sophie Kinsella wrote under another name - Madeleine Wickham. What a pleasant surprise!As a fan of the Shopaholic Series and found this book to actually be more like Sophie's recent title - the Undomestic Goddess. The dialog was witty yet believable. I found myself wanting to rush in and protect Candice from the evil Heather comfort Roxanne during her loss and tell Maggie that everything was going to be alright and she would adjust to motherhood just fine. As a new mom I could totally empathize with Maggie and her struggles!I can't wait to read more titles by Madeleine! , 4.0
 This book chronicles the lives of three friends who get together every month to drink and catch up.Roxanne is having an affair with a married man with children but wont tell her friends who he is until circumstances force her to reveal all to the two people who know her best.Maggie used to be in charge at the magizine that they work at until the birth of her daughter. Afterwards she admits that she wants to go back to work because being a mother is a lot harder than she realized.Constance feels bad after she sees a woman named Heather working at the bar where she and her friends go to drink.

 I have read all the Sophie Kinsella books (Shopaholic etc.) as a fun People-magazine type of diversion when needed. I had no idea that was a pen name and that Madeleine Wickham also writes as herself. I was in the mood for a chicklit novel and this one hit all the right notes for me - solid 30+ aged women characters each struggling with their own personal issues (career challenges new motherhood death of a lover) in a vibrant urban setting (London). It's not high literature but the writing is better than in much chicklit and the characters are more compelling too. I personally liked this a lot more than the Kinsella stuff because the characters have more depth and maturity. It's not quite as humorous/campy as the stuff the author writes under the Kinsella name but that was fine with me.So if you are looking for this kind of thing give it a whirl! I will definitely be checking out more Wickham books. , 5.0

 I must say that I was very impressed with 'Cocktails for Three!'.You read about the tales of 3 best friends who meet at a Manhattan Bar the same night every month. They get to catch up on everything that is going on with their lives.Maggie is pregnant. Roxanne has been dating a married man for 6 years. Candice has such a warm heart and can't seem to say 'NO.'The end of the book will throw you for a loop. As other reviews have said you will not see it coming.This book kept me wanting to know what was going to happen next to the (3) characters. I am sure that you will be able to identify a personal friend of yours for Maggie Roxanne and Candice. I was able to finish in just (1) day which is rare for me.I can't wait to check out Wickman's other two books.Enjoy! , 5.0
 Cocktails for Three is a fun and feisty novel about three Londoners at critical points in their lives. They get together at their favorite bar after a difficult day at The Londoner -- a fashion magazine where they all work -- to discuss their latest exploits through cocktails. Each one of them is facing a dilemma.Candice is a successful writer but her stabilized career becomes threatened when she stumbles upon Heather an old friend from high school...Maggie is a married woman awaiting the arrival of her first child. She is quite content with her position as editor for The Londoner which is why she is torn between continuing her career and giving it all up to become a full-time wife and mother...Roxanne is beautiful glamorous and free-spirited. However she is stuck in a relationship that's going nowhere for the man in question is married with children...Cocktails for Three is a wickedly funny read that could satisfy all Chick Lit enthusiasts. Despite its banal and recycled plot the novel's sharp dialogue believable characterization and excellent prose make the novel a definite must read... , 4.0
 I have read and loved all of Sophie Kinsella's novels so when I found this in a bookstore over the weekend I jumped at the chance to read something new by her. I had no idea she was also writing under another name!I found Cocktails For Three to be a quick fun and entertaining read. It certainly passed the time I spent in the airport over the weekend very fast. But I found the story at times to be a bit far-fetched and unrealistic. I liked the Shopaholic series better. It's an overall feel good fun novel but not anything earth-shattering. , 3.0
 Madeleine Wickham proves once again that she is more than just a 'chick lit' author. Though her novels are short they do pack a punch and try to teach a little life lesson besides.Candice Maggie and Roxanne are best friends who work at the Londoner a monthly magazine in - where else? - London and meet on the first of the month for cocktails at the Manhattan Bar. This particular month finds Maggie ready to give birth Roxanne still with her married with children boyfriend and Candice having just broken up with her co-worker boyfriend Justin. Candice recognizes their waitress as a girl she was at school with and says her name just as she realizes that her recognition was probably best kept to herself as the waitress Heather Trelawney had to leave school when her family lost all their money due to Candice's swindling father. It strikes good-hearted Candice that she can try and make amends to Heather by helping her get a job at the magazine. Unfortunately her good deeds don't stop there and as the saying goes 'No good deed goes unpunished.'Follow these friends through the ups and downs of motherhood affairs death and evil machinations and enjoy every page of it. , 4.0
 Sophie Kinsella is one of my favorite authors and I have been anxiously anticipating a new release from her to no avail but I had no idea that she had previously penned five novels under the name Madeleine Wickham! Although 'COCKTAILS FOR THREE' is not her usual fare it still contained all of the spark and flare that we have come to expect from Ms Kinsella or should I say Ms Wickham.'COCKTAILS FOR THREE' is the story of three best friends who are each keeping major secrets from each other. The sexy and worldly Roxanne has been seeing a married man for the last six years but has yet to reveal his identity to anyone but when her friends find out it is sure to astound them. Candice is the sweet-faced girl that is easily taken advantage of and when a new 'friend' sets her sights on Candice she attempts to do just that. Maggie the high powered no-nonsense editor of the magazine where they all work finds herself overwhelmed when she finds herself relinquishing all of her power to her newborn daughter. At a time when these three need each other more than ever their secrets seem to be breaking them apart. Will these three ever be able to come clean and get their lives as well as their relationships back on track?Anyone who has read Ms Wickham's books penned under the name Sophie Kinsella will be able to clearly tell that these are two very different sides to the same personality. While Sophie Kinsella's books kept me laughing so hard I'd have to put the book down at times to regroup Madeleine Wickham's books are more refined and subdued in comparison. I will however be purchasing all books by Madeleine Wickham as well as all future books by Sophie Kinsella! , 4.0
 I loved this book! I really didn't want it to end. It was just easy to read with likeable characters that you wanted to know more about. I could have kept right on reading! The best thing about this book is it made me want to find my old girlfriends. It made me miss those late night chats and junk food binges. This story is mostly about friendship and the importance of it in our lives. We all make mistakes and go through rough times but your friends are there to back you up.If you enjoy books about young women and friendship this book is for you. If you miss your old girlfriends or cherish the ones you still have read this book. You just may be calling them up when you're done! , 5.0
 Another awesome chick lit book from the Queen herself Sophie Kinsella (for those who don't know Sophie Kinsella is Madeline Wickham's pen name). I can't tell you how excited I was to learn that Madeline Wickham was Sophie Kinsella because she is simply the best.Cocktails for Three is a book about three friends. Maggie, 5.0
 I've been searching for a book that really makes me laugh characters I can relate and enjoy and a story that keeps me interested beyond the first 30 pages. Well I found it! 'Cocktails for Three' by English author Madeleine Wickham had me completely enchanted. I found the three main characters (Maggie - the pregnant one on maternity leave / Roxanne - the dating a married man one / Candice - the trusting and will do anything for a person in need one) all well rounded and hilarious.'Cocktails' goes beyond your basic 'friends forever' novel and dives into real life problems and the effects those decisions have on you and those around you.I found this book really unique and sparkling with touches of really dark and edgy comedy. A great find! I hope others will discover this secret of mine. , 5.0
 I loved all of Sophie Kinsella's books. This book is definitely not as good as the Shopaholic Series. The characters aren't really well-defined the plot meanders at the end. You can avoid this book and not miss much. , 2.0
 COCTAILS FOR THREE is a story about 3 GFs and their chaotic lives. All 3 work for the fictional magazine the Londoner. Each struggles with relationship issues. Candice is an idealist who disses her too-friendly flat neighbor Ed but eagerly embraces a stranger named Heather. Roxanne has a secret married lover. Maggie is a new mother who is exhausted and feels like a complete failure. All 3 central characters are likable even when they are not behaving very well. I felt compassion for Maggie who was clearly exhausted and overwhelmed by motherhood. I wanted to slap Candice who was so bent on being Mother Theresa that she was completely blind to reality. I wanted to hug Roxanne then tell her to get her own life and not steal someone else's. If the reader cares about the central figures in a novel the author has successfully brought her characters to life. Madeleine Wickham has managed to weave mystery intrigue and even a sense of reality into each storyline. Cocktails for Three has a bit of 'Mean Girl' in it and the arrogant vindictive ex-boyfriend everyone loves to hate. It's fun easy to read and engaging. Once you start it you won't want to put it down. Highly recommended. , 3.0
 Just finished the book! I wasnt able to put it down all day. I love how the author can take on the raw emotion of what each character is feeling. I really didnt expect the book to take so many different turns. What a fun read for mothers friends or young working women. , 5.0
 After reading all of Sophia's Shopoholic series I was pleased to find this book written by the same author. I enjoyed reading this books since it is about 3 friends who go though different struggles and all the while hiding them from each other. I was able to relate to each character. Since noone's life is perfect it is nice to have a book that shows you it does not matter who you are there is still some imprefections in all of us where we express them or not. It is a easy to read but hard to put down book. I look foward to reading other books by Madeleine. , 4.0
 I haven't had a chance to read in quite some time and was just looking for a fun not too terribly complicated read. This was my book! It's a fun read that kept me coming back for more. The characters were all like us and our friends....very real very likable.If you like Jane Green Maeve Binchy Bridget Jones's Diary and Lisa Jewel you'll love this. It's not literary genius but is fun and entertaining. , 4.0
 I am a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella and normally love her books under the name of Madeline Wickham too. This book however drove me nuts! I only made it about 1/4 of the way through before I returned it to the store - luckily I hadn't cracked the spine and they took it back and refunded my money. This book is so terrible that I couldn't even make it past the first 1/4 of it - the characters were horrible shallow people and the plot is so see-through. Clearly this book is one of Sophie's earlier works - the 'plot' is terrible. Don't waste your money - don't take a chance in case you crack the spine - you won't be able to return it! Spend your money on one of Sophie Kinsella's novels instead - 'Remember Me' is hysterical and a great easy read. 'Cocktails for 3' is painful trash. , 1.0
 Like all of Madeleine Wickham/Sophie Kinsella's book this one is jammed with wittiness and excitement that leaves you wanting to turn the pages faster than you can read. But I felt that it was also an honest look at friendships/realtionships. It explored the busyness in all of our lives that bring us to overlooking the needs and feeliings of our friends and unitentially taking them forgranted no matter how solid and close the friendship. This book ends with a sweet yet subtle reminder that true and successful friendhsips take vulernability and and self-less-ness. , 5.0
