" Disc One (73",5.0
" Yes indeed the game was beautiful. Too bad no one really knows about it. When i played the game I absolutely loved it. A true masterpiece one of squaresofts best by far. But when I got the Soundtrack it was mind blowing. Every Song was on it. Plus the caftsmanship from the director was just overwhelming. The game and soundtrack by far are the best in squaresofts history. Never has there been a great combination. From Listening threw out Disc one which features some really cool Resident Evil only in symphony mode. Yes this Soundtrack is by far the best Video Game soundtrack that I have ever gotten. All I have to say is get the game first once you beat it. Get the soundtrack next. You'll know what I mean by what a true RPG game and music is all about. ",5.0
" With Vagrant Story Sakimoto expertly combines dissonance ambience and melody to create a simply gorgeous videogame score. In fact I'm going to call it one of Squaresoft's best. There is not one dud in the soundtrack. It's even better in-game but buy the soundtrack! ",5.0
" The only critiscm I have about this sound track are the two bonus tracks (which don't appear in the game and add nothing to the preceding tracks on the cds) and the strange morph that one of the tracks (I believe that it is Escape) takes turning from a good piece of music into something that seems to have escaped from the eighties.Apart from that I can't recommend this OST highly enough especially Disc 2 - Track 29 -Staff Roll which unlike the other tracks on the disc is an acoustic Strings Piece that really shows off Hitoshi Sakimoto's talents as a composer. ",5.0
" When I heard the first few tracks of this OST in an ill-fated battle track contest I can't say I was too impressed. They seemed to be rather bland and even downright boring. However I used to also think the same thing about the Final Fantasy Tactics soundtrack which I now adore. That and I'm not the type to give up on an entire soundtrack after listening to just a few songs once or twice.That said I took it upon myself to find the Vagrant Story soundtrack and I forced myself to listen to it. Several times. Dozens of times even. I played it on the PC. In the car and my portable players. Eventually it began to grow on me. I began to appericiate its incredibly dark ambience its undeniable intelligence the wonderful quality of the synth and the sheer complexity of the compositions a delight for people like me who like to analyze things.I think I first realized 'I love this soundtrack' when I felt shivers running down my spine while listening to the end of 'Climax of the Grayland Case.' How beautiful! Or maybe it was when it thought to myself 'That heavy piano playing really does remind me of iron!' while listening to 'Iron Crab'. Or perhaps it was when I was listening to 'Staff Roll' and it made my day a little happier when the main melody kicked in at around 4",5.0
" Excellent stockings for long shifts on your feet - not too tight not too loose...garment integrity is longer than package states (with proper care). ",5.0
" After I had a DVT my doctor required me to wear compression stockings. I wore ugly white TED hose and yucky thick brown stockings. Then I found Jobst UltraSheer. They gave me the compression I needed (15-20) but looked like regular pantyhose. Even though my blood clot has been gone for 4 years I still buy these to wear as support stockings because they make my legs feel so nice.**Note I have problems with the rubberized tops rolling down my thigh. I tried the Jobst adhesive but I hated having my skin pulled all day. I bought an inexpensive garter belt and it works fine and helps keep the stockings from rolling. ",5.0
" My doctor recommended the thigh high version of this product but I became very aggravated with them constantly rolling down through the course of the day. They were never comfortable. With my doctor's permission I switched over to the knee highs and they are WONDERFUL!!! I don't even know I'm wearing them! They totally control my calf aching and swelling. Would highly recommend them!!! ",5.0
" Stockings fit well and are comfortable. Haven't had the opportunity to see how effective they are in preventing edema from air travel. ",5.0
" Excellent product. However they are very difficult to get on for older people. I feel like I've had a full day workout after getting them on. Also as the day wears on they begin to roll down from the top and create a very deep ridge in the skin. I have to wear them so if those two difficulties could be addressed it would be such a help. ",5.0
" Does a very good job of relieving fatigue. This is a well known brand and is certainly comfortable enough to wear all day. Even if your doctor didn't prescribe these but you are on your feet alot take care of yourself and buy these. ",5.0
" It is wonderful to find exactly what you are looking for. I didn't after three years using them I found they have them with a closed toes. I love them ",5.0
" I've always had pain in my legs during long travels either by car or plane when you can't move very much. I used them for a recent trip consisting on 6 flights total and I could feel the difference. I wasn't totally stiff when I got off the planes. They do stay in place with the band at the top. Just be careful they tear as easily as stockings. If you'll use them much you better get a couple of extra pairs. ",5.0

" I thoroughly enjoyed Rising Sons and Daughters. I don't know of any other book that looks at Japanese society from the point of view of its young people poised as they are between their parents' age-old Japanese culture of restraint and obedience to the will of the community and their peers' adulation of Western culture. True to form the 'New Young' of Japan seem to be creating an 'international' blend as the Ando family demonstrates in this beautifully written book of vignettes of the private lives of members of this family. Steven Wardell is clearly a talented young author adopted for some of his schooling into this family of four teens and thus able to view family life in Japan from the inside out. A great read! ",5.0
" Wondering what the hell has happened to the moral aspect of modern American culture ? This book is a lucid well argued explanation of the simple fact that we have become so totally focused on our individual RIGHTS that we have completely ignored and even mocked our personal and public responsibilities. The final response and indictment of Robert Ringer's best seller LOOKING OUT FOR #1. This is a great time for anyone who is disgusted with the boorish state of American media politics and discourse in general to clear their heads for the substantial challenges that lie before us not only as Americans but as human beings. A great book ",5.0
" Joy in God--necessary? Or simply optional??? John Piper explains why that if Christ is to be the sun at the center of the solar system of our lives then He must also be our supreme joy over all other 'lesser treasures.' Glorifying God can only be done from a heart that is glad in God. Deep joy in God is the true foundation for all obedience; treasuring Him over all things is the only Christ-exalting motivation to endure suffering...especially to willfuly choose suffering.Show it to your Youth Group Men's/Women's Group or Home Bible Study. Set your church ablaze with a passion for the glory of God in the supremacy of Christ over all things in this world. Everything being fueled by a Spirit produced joy and satisfaction in the Lord Himself--to His praise and renoun!Only because of grace--Jeffrey ",5.0
" Piper has a passion for the glory of Christ that is contagious. I've watched these videos multiple times and glean something from it every time. Amazing that he presents this MEATY material to a youth group and they are transfixed the entire time.I don't really care for the youth interviews but I understand given the format of the original presentation. I've used this in a men's group and all enjoyed the material and we had some great discussions.I'd recommend to anybody. The humility and genuine concern of Piper toward his audience is refreshing against some of the other more famous 'christian leaders' today. ",5.0
" I am so grateful for the Blazing Center DVD and the exceptional price. I enjoyed immensely seeing the dynamic presentation by an author I have read for all these years. I would love to see this DVD given to many of our grandchildren. ",5.0

" Though it would be nice to have a solid polished brass fireplace screen this product certainly fits our needs. For the price it looks quite attractive and provides what we wanted in safety. It sets off our polished brass in our living room and serves the purpose to protect against accidents for our granddaughters. Quick service on delivery as well. ",5.0
" We were surprised. Pleasantly.A weighty perfect model of this classic screen would certainly not be available for anything close to the price of the Uniflame model but the Uniflame looks amazingly good anyway. This thing does the trick!We bought it to replace an 'original' solid brass model costing nearly $500 (and it's cheap construction design eventually giving way to its heaviness when moved). As long as someone doesn't examine the new screen from close-up it actually looks better (not really terrible at all close-up) and it's lighter weight makes it easy to handle.JRT ",5.0
" This is an excellent fireplace screen for the price. I was somewhat surprised at how light the screen is as compared to other fireplace screens I have in the house. You certainly won't have a hard time moving it away from the fireplace. I actually purchased it to put in front of a gas fireplace in order to make the fire look more authentic and it does the job ! ",5.0
" Product arrived on the third day after I ordered despite a delivery estimate of 7-10 days. I'm impressed with both the product and the marketplace seller (PrimeNetShops). The screen came well packaged and in good shape. One of the decorative knobs on top had come unscrewed and was in the bottom of the box but it re-attached with ease. It's light enough that it can be moved with ease but still feels sturdy enough that it should last for years to come. Great product great experience. Everything that is right about Amazon all in one order! ",5.0
" Man some more jammin tracks from the SUC. This is Pokey's first official record....and sh** is sooo real. Love the production everything is real nice & screwed out. This is among the last of the great SUC records. Not to say they've fallen off....just they've downsized so much with the deaths of the screw pioneers. Sad but true. If ya love Tx rap you've gotta get this 1. Somethin to kickback & blow big too somethin to jam in the ride. So underrated right here. I wish people would forget all the bullsh** on BET/MTV and check what's happening in Houston. But i guess...it's sadly almost too late. Pat's gone hawk's gone...screw Moe Pimp C Big Steve. Makes me sad. Regardless Pokey is still alive and making new music keeping the legacy alive. And this is a great place to start with him. Classic record. Love it man ",5.0

Thank you Bear Family! ",5.0
" This book contains a great amount of vocabulary. It teaches you the Anglicized versions of certain words such as 'teacher' but it also gives you the Yoruba word. Although I didn't appreciate the Anglicized words at first they are good to know because a lot of people use them. The CD is an excellent and necessary addition to the book. There are lots of dialogues and lists of vocabulary on them (there are 2 CDs). The CD does skip over some of the exercises in the book which I guess you're supposed to go over by yourself or with a teacher though. All in all it's a great set and if mastered can bring the user to a high level of fluency. I also like that the narrator who speaks English to announce the lessons is a native speaker and doesn't butcher the names of the characters in the dialogues. There is a Yoruba book/CD set created by another publisher who uses a British narrator. It really throws you off course throughout the CD. Watch out for that one and buy this one instead! ",5.0

" My 4 year old daughter LOVES this game. She sings the 'Strike Up The Band and Clap Your Hands for Kelly's Pet Parade!' song around the house. She can dress the Kelly kids 'train' each pet (teach the pony to jump etc.) clean and get the animals ready for the parade (paint the elephant's toe nails etc.) and decorate the floats...all by herself. She'll get everything ready (showing me everything she has accomplished along the way) and then we'll watch her special parade. A wonderfully cute game that I highly recommend.She can mostly do the entire game on her own. I have it installed on a laptop so she is actually using the inset mouse and can still do the game. The only one she has a tough time with is the Polar Bear catching fish game. It's tricky to move your finger on the mouse pad and click at the same time to catch the fish. It would be much easier using a regular mouse. ",5.0

" My 6-year old and 5-year old both really enjoy this game. Has lots to do with several different animals to prepare for the parade. You get to design a float and it just endless fun! Graphics and animation are very colorful and cute. It's a winner! ",5.0
" Apparently this is about the best $... I have spent lately (aside from the Gameboy game I sent my nephew). My niece is mesmorized by this game and it is keeping my sister busy building parades. My niece is a little too young to run this program by herself but she has definitely figured out what button needs to be pushed to make the parade start! My sister also told me that she likes the fact that you can save multiple parades for those days when she just doesn't have time to help create a new one. This seems to be a winner! ",5.0
" I got this for my 3 1/2 yr old for Christmas and both her and her 7 yr old sister LOVE it! They have played it for hours. The graphics are very good and it has lots of cute and entertaining games! I highly recommend this one! It's worth the money! ",5.0

" If you've played this game in the arcade and liked it then you'll definitely like this version to play at home whenever you like. You don't need a supercomputer to run it and the graphics and controls are amazing and faithful to the incredibly fun and fast arcade experience. This version also has plenty of unlockables which you get by playing and earning miles as well as mini-games that are a fun diversion from the classic arcade game. It has the European-themed levels of Outrun2 and the America-themed levels of Outrun2 SP for a total of 30 stages to race through in the classic Outrun-branching style or sequentially or with challenges such as beating rival racers. This game is affordable fun and has plenty of replay value. You may not want to play it for hours and hours but you'll keep coming back to it if you like to get a speedy arcade fix every now and then. ",5.0
" I remember playing Outrun in the arcades when it came out in the I think it was eighties. It had flashy graphics flashy steering wheel pedals and corny but catchy music. It was the kind of game I'd play on the way out of the arcade when all but the last dribbles of coinage had been spent on the more 'serious' (read challenging) games. Actually when I think about it Outrun was always placed by the entrance perhaps for this reason. Main meal of games inside followed by quick dessert on the way out. And Outrun is quick. And fun. And flashy. Colourful pretty and simple. Not much depth here but some very cool twists on your standard arcade racer. Lots of different Ferraris lots of different scenery and wow does it look good! Pure unadulterated eye candy. Two problems however. It wont run on full accelerated sound on my sound card (budget Creative) so I have to switch the acceleration back to minimum through my control panel or the game will just keep crashing when it comes time to race. Secondly the configuration for gamepad bites. It won't allow me to allocate the buttons I want for acceleration and braking so I end up using the right analogue joystick for both (left to accelerate right to brake). Sounds dicky and I suppose it is but it's actually pretty easy to get used to. As far as I'm aware there are no patches for said problems. Despite these issues Outrun 2006 C2C is a blast fun from go to wo. It's sugary sweet and just the thing for a low gaming BSL. ",5.0

" Thanks to my grandparents who came to America in the first decade of the 20th century I grew up and have had a good life. Thanks to my grandparents I didn't become a piece of ash or a few tossed out bones in an Eastern European field at the age of 2. Wars are wars; they've occured throughout human history but in most of them whole civilizations didn't disappear. But the Eastern European Jewish world is gone forever. I might belong to the same gene pool but compared to the characters in Isaac Bashevis Singer's stories I'm as American as apple pie. Irish-Americans can discover their roots in Ireland Chinese-Americans in China and so on but not me. My cultural roots are gone forever. The only way I can learn them is through reading literature written by Singer Shalom Aleichem Isaac Babel and others who describe that vanished world. So obviously my interest and pleasure in reading such wonderful tales as appear in THE SEANCE and OTHER STORIES is all the more. Never mind my personal reasons. These amazing stories by a Nobel Prize winner will stay with you for a long time. The strange sad characters afflicted by poverty and by life bring us face to face with common human personalities of all times and places while also depicting the conditions and peculiar relationships of Jews in Poland too. Magic religion animals thieves rabbis prostitutes mystics Holocaust survivors Talmudic scholars prisoners books butchers and shopkeepers crowd the pages. In each story you find pathos and tragedy happiness and satisfaction tensions and transformations. Two of the stories 'The Seance' and 'The Letter Writer' must rank with the best stories I have ever read; none of the others are bad. If you have never read Singer this is an excellent book to start with. If you have you know what I am talking about. This is the great writer at the top of his form. ",5.0
" Isaac Bashevis Singer was no doubt one of the greatest short story writers - ever! The various collections in the end also earned him a very well deserved Nobel Prize for literature in 1978. Several of his stories were first published in magazines like The New Yorker Encounter and Playboy. The first collection I read was Passions and Other Stories which immediately made me realise what a master Isaac Bashevis Singer was. Later I have read several of his novels and short stories where especially the collections Gimpel the Fool Short Friday and The Seance are at least as good as Passions. All a magnificent world of Isaac Bashevis Singer's saints and sinners. Sad funny ironic poignant and seeming to come from Singer's pen without any efforts. This is what good short stories is all about! ",5.0

" Of many CDs I've purchased in the last couple of years this easily ranks as one of the best. Kudos to Muse for finally recording Spaulding as a leader in 1988 and now to Joel Dorn for reissuing the disk.As the title indicates 'Brilliant Corners' is filled with music by Monk. But what stands out is the freshness of the interpretations of the master's pieces. Rather than simply trying to sound like Monk Spaulding and his cohorts try -- very successfully -- to make music that builds on Monk's ideas.Spaulding tears through every solo he has on alto and offers beautiful contrast with his flute playing as on 'Let's Cool One.' He's aided by trumpeter Wallace Roney who abandons his occasional propensity for imitating Miles Davis and instead lets his own sound shine through. Pianist Mulgrew Miller has never sounded better. In fact the whole group (Ron Carter on bass and Kenny Washington on drums) strongly delivers the message that they are playing music that they love. There is no better way to express that love than by offering the robust voicings that you hear on this disk.If there is a regret when you listen to this music it is that Spaulding who contributed so much to Blue Note dates in the '60s has had so few opportunities to further explore his own muse. Better late than never. ",5.0
" Story goes that after a number of excellent second horn sessions on mid 60's Blue Note where flute.altoand soprano were wielded masterfully by James Spaulding he was given a shot as a leader.He was the non star(leader) that was called in manymany times.But at the point he got his offer Direction/Production had switched from Alfred Lion to Francis Wolff and A&R; fro Ike Quebec to Duke Pearson.Bottom line was they offered Spaulding a shot if he would fit into the new funky blues idiom of the Liberty era and he refused not being true to the hard bop form.Well even though he recorded few albums as a leader latter on labels like Muse('Smile Of The Snake' and 'Blues Nexus are also fine 4 star or better efforts).He he has and excellent session with Wallace Ronney on trumpetMulgrew Miller and Ron Carter on bass and Kenny Washington on drums.Fine line up.And though there are so many Monk tribute Lp's it is the musicianship wielded with passion that makes this a cut of above.As mentioned his flute playing is fine.I find jazz flute hit or miss and here it just works fine.Not a direct copy of the Monk style it shows th timeless of the compositions (not that a total analogue LP with some personal character is bad-see Walter Davis Jr. piano solo 'In Walked Thelonius').I'd call this no an essential Lp but for Monk fans it may be.CheersChazz ",5.0
" Few pieces of music in the history of the gramophone can have suffered such indignities at the hands of insensitive record producers as Saint-Sans's Third Symphony. A glance through the catalogues might suggest one is spoiled for choice but to date I have only found two recordings which do full justice to the work. Now here's a third although altogether different. . . this is a recording which not only deserves repeated listening but positively demands it. Yu reveals just what a magnificent piece of music this is; shorn of its customary sonic spectacle the brilliant craftsmanship of Saint-Sans's writing is displayed in unimpeded glory. . .In The Carnival of the animals . . . Yu opts for the version for large orchestra complete with glass harmonica (adeptly played by Alasdair Malloy) and while it is again characterized by meticulous attention to detail it is also a performance full of buoyant wit. . .

Five years later she still takes many supplementary courses each year to continue her education. Most of her free time is spend with distance learning courses or reaching herbs. Chinese Medicine is vast and deep. A 5 year basic study is not nearly enough time to understand this medicine. In Chinese Medicine they say even a lifetime is not long enough to understand this medicine. Thankfully for the lay person we have this book!I personally own 2 copies of this book. One I have at home the other is in our Chinese Medicine office.

" The Gathering to me has always been an escape from the everyday music you hear. So when I heard they were releasing a B-sides and rarities collection I was more than happy. Every expectation I had they met. I'm dumbfounded as to how The Gathering can create such innovative and beautiful music yet they're still somehow overlooked. From the epic orchestrations to Anneke's jawdropping voice there's no reason that everyone shouldn't love this music. Needless to say if you liked The Gathering before you got this CD if anything you'll like them more coming out of listening to it.Disc one acts as the B-sides. A lot of B-sides have horrible sound quality but the ones on this compilation sound as if they were on a CD but were taken off at the extreme last minute. There's a polished feel but not so polished that the music feels fabricated. The live versions featured on here are astounding. If you didn't look at the back cover to know they were live you'd never guess it. Anneke's voice is gorgeous and the band is just simply amazing. How they don't miss a single beat I'll never know. The covers Dead Can Dance's In Power We Entrust The Love Advocated Slowdive's When The Sun Hits and Talk Talk's Life's What You Make It are about the best covers I've ever heard. Quite often you hear a band just desecrate the original but with The Gathering it feels like they took they're time while doing the originals justice.Disc two serves as the rarities section. From the opening track New Moon Different Day you know that The Gathering is eons better than almost any band playing music today. Anneke's vocals simply soar and will give you goosebumps that I will guarantee. It doesn't end there though each song is equally as good as the last. Even the demos have a sound quality that could rival a studio CD. The two previously unreleased instrumentals Diamond Box and Hjelmar's stand true to the ones that are released. The beauty is palpable and shows tremendous skill skill that no radio band will ever come close to. Travel from the CD How To Measure A Planet? has always been my favorite song by The Gathering. To hear the demo is really something though it sounds completely different while still sounding exactly the same. My second favorite track of their's Nighttime Birds is the same case as Travel. I do think Anneke's vocals are stronger on Nighttime Birds though.Overall my favorite songs are In Power We Entrust The Love Advocated Frail Life's What You Make It New Moon Different Day Nighttime Birds and Travel. The Gathering is a band I've always found to be one that you have to experience rather than listen to. Yes you can pick favorite songs but overall each CD they released and even this collection seem to be made to go together. Each song seems to flow into the next seamlessly. In my opinion no band does this genre more justice than The Gathering does. ",5.0
" All fans of The Gathering need to check this out especially those in the States where the majority of these songs are nearly impossible to find anywhere else. This compilation is worth buying for 'In Power We Entrust the Love Advocated' (Dead Can Dance cover) and 'When the Sun Hits' (Slowdive cover) alone; both are heartbreakingly beautiful and feature some of Anneke's finest vocals.Fans of The Gathering's albums Mandylion and Nighttime Birds will be delighted with 'Adrenaline' a very catchy song that was written because the band needed another fast simple rocking song to play at concerts.I think The Gathering's greatest album is How to Measure a Planet and it is awesome to finally hear the demos for songs like 'Travel' 'My Electricity' and 'Red is a Slow Colour.' 'Travel' especially went through a lot of transformations before its final version.This double-CD has so much to offer. There are also detailed song descriptions written by the band and several photos on the inside booklet. ",5.0
" If I could only have one selection by The Gathering this would be it. Some of the alternate versions are better than what was originally released (e.g. instrumental version of Kevin's Telescope).

" Four DVDs in the 'Thomas & Friends' series are sure to delight young viewers ages 2 and up with the exciting adventures of Thomas the Tank Engine and his transportational friends. Each affordably priced DVD features narration by celebrity George Carlin roughly 40 minutes of short stories plus another 60 minutes of bonus features such as sing-along songs DVD games and character galleries. 'A Big Day for Thomas' covers Thomas' adventure when he gets to pull his very own train for the first time; 'Trust Thomas & Other Stories' follows Thomas' discovery of a new way to cross a river; 'Percy's Ghostly Trick & Other Thomas Stories' is a spooky adventure in which Percy's mischievous trick to make Thomas believe in ghosts backfires when Percy puffs into a big pile of hay. 'Thomas & The Special Letter' sets up a conflict with George a bad-tempered steamroller convinced that roads are more important than rails. Since the many stories on each DVD are so short they can be shown to young people who have only a few spare minutes such as right before bedtime or all at once.

" First of all let me say that I love Thomas the Tank Engine. My 6-year-old son has loved Thomas for 3+ years running and I am very grateful for all the good times the three of us have had. That having been said this is a compilation VHS. You will not find any new stories on this one. However it is worth viewing (and getting if you don't have a big collection) if you have children. We got this as a gift from friends so having duplicates of the stories was not a big problem with us. Interspersed between the stories is what seems to be an advertisement for the 'Day Out With Thomas.' It is interesting to watch but is not informative for one actually thinking about participating in one of the programs.ABOUT THE STORIES",5.0
" My son has several of the Thomas DVDs and while he's just as content to watch any of them this is his favorite. The episodes with Bertie and Terrance are great. Overall a wonderful collection of earlier Thomas narrated by George Carlin. The interviews with kids are cute and provide more than just the usual shots of various engines. I find this DVD better than the 'Best of' engines ones because of the variety. Plus my son has no clear favorite and enjoys watching them all. ",5.0

" Anyone who wants to understand the movies of the Soviet Union should start with this book. It is very thorough and written in a lively bright style that is free of academic jargon.Kenez begins with the pre-Revolutionary film industry and shows how it broke down and was built back up by the Soviets. He pays equal attention to the 'high art' films that were famous in the West for decades (those of Eisenstein and Pudovkin) and the entertainment films that attracted the average Soviet citizen (such as the musical comedies of the 1930s like 'Volga-Volga.') He shows how Soviet movies responded to the imposition of Socialist Realism World War II and the cultural freeze of the late Stalin era.The only problem with this book is that it is TOO SHORT. Upon reaching the end the reader wants to see Kenez tackle the films of the Khrushchev Thaw and the Brezhnev era. However one should be thankful for what one has and in this volume one has a truly indispensible book. ",5.0

" This book was awesome. A fast paced riveting novel by an author I am coming to find just CANNOT disappoint me. I am hooked on her Carpathians and now find that I will run just as fast to the bookstore when her next gothic comes out.THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a terrific love story and mystery set in a supposedly cursed castle that has everything from grinning gargoyles to an impressive maze. The hero and heroine are just as riveting in their fascinatin for each other and then their entanglement in the mystery of THE SCARLETTI CURSE. I highly recommend this book to all readers Feehan fan or not. But be warned by the time you turn the last page of this book you will be hooked on Christine Feehan. ",5.0

You can use any search engine to get to it. But this book really is wonderful! It can really stand on it's own! I can't wait for more from this author. The publishing company needs to publish her stuff quicker than this! Can't wait till Darius's story Dark Fire! Feel free for anyone to e-mail with any questions! I'll sell you on these books! ",5.0
" The heroine Nicoletta is the village healer. Overlord Don Giovanni exercises his right to select a village girl as his bride and chooses Nicoletta against her wishes. His home the Palazzio is a foreboding place mysterious and frightening to the villagers...a place with a history of death. Giovanni is able to communicate with Nicoletta mind to mind...the only similarity to the Dark Series Heroes...bringing a subtle sensuality to their burgeoning relationship...a welcome change from the 'pounce on each other in the first chapter' genre. Feehan continues to bring us dark heroes and independant heroines who find love in the sharing of each others gifts. ",5.0

I started to read it and in the first chapter it grabbed me and I couldn't put it down. I read it in one day (of course I got no work done) but it was well worth it.

" I became a fan of Christine's writing through her 'Dark' series and although this ventured into different territory I was not disappointed. Christine's style and gift for writing wonderful heroes and heroines along with a fascinating story is not lost. Nicoletta is a strong compassionate courageous heroine that learns to make the best of a frightening and seemingly hopeless situation. She is forced into marriage with the mysterious Giovanni Scarletti who's reputation of darkness and danger strikes fear in the hearts of most in her village. To make matters worse once married she will be forced to live in the cursed Scarletti palazzo secretly nicknamed the 'Palazzo Della Morte' where few women who enter manage to escape with their lives. Despite her hesitation she soon discovers there is a powerful attraction between she and Giovanni and seeks to unravel the mystery surrounding her own mother's death in the castle years ago. Is Giovanni the monster her fellow villagers whispered he was or could there be much more to him than she first imagined? Giovanni is just the type of hero I enjoy like the heroine he is one that can both frighten me yet manage to touch my heart at the same time. The story kept me on the edge of my seat. For fans of the paranormal there is that aspect as well. Nicoletta is gifted with a healing power and Giovanni has the power to speak directly into your mind. Kudos to Christine for the many hours of enjoyment her novels provide! ",5.0
" Ms. Feehan has written another entertaining and engrossing book. I got very little sleep the day I sat down to read Scarletti Curse I didn't stop until I had read every page.Ms. Feehan's gothic bears her trademark paranormal touch. The hero Don Giovanni Scarletti has telepathic abilities and the heroine Nicoletta has healing abilities. While helping the Don's sick niece Nicoletta catches the eye of the Giovanni who decides that he wants her for his bride. Nicoletta is less than thrilled at that honor since both her mother and aunt were killed under suspicious circumstances while employed at Palazzo Scarletti a.k.a Palazzo della Morte (palace of death). Thus begins the tale of our fair hero and heroine. Will the Don be able to win Nicoletta`s heart? Should Nicoletta trust Giovanni? Will Nicoletta be the next victim of the Scarletti curse? What dark secret is the Scarletti family hiding? Strap up and get ready for one heck of ride as Nicoletta and Giovanni learn things that they never expected about themselves and each other.Looking forward to reading more from this author. ",5.0

" I really love The Scarletti Curse having reread it for more than 5 times I believe.The pacing is good with enough action excitement and unconditional love (a necessity to destroy the evil curse at work).The book starts with village girl Nicoletta being summoned to accompany the village 'healer' Maria Pia who raised Nicoletta since her mother's death to the Scarletti Palazzo. They keep this charade to prevent the people at the palazzo knowing about Nicoletta's extraordinary healing powers (this heritage is explained in the Carpathian book 'Dark Symphony in which the lifemate is a descendant of the main characters/couple). As Maria Pia is a midwife herself this causes no problem.At the palazzo the patients turned out to be Don Giovanni Scarletti and his niece Sofia suffering from food poisoning. While both 'healer' and assistant do their work Don Scarletti keeps observing Nicoletta asking her questions when Maria Pia fell asleep and after many dissatisfying non-answers says 'I am not so blind as you and the healer seem to think'!A few days later the 'healer' and assistant were summoned to the palazzo again but this time Nicoletta knows that no one is ill. Maria Pia therefore went back to the Palazzo with another assistant but this assistant is old and when asked about Nicoletta kept telling the Don how wonderful and extraordinary she really is. This gives Don Giovanni a reason to choose a bride at The Bridal Convent. His choice is Nicoletta who gets escorted (begging and struggling) back to the palazzo by the Don.In the following days up to and after the wedding arguments heat up a few murders commited the staff gossip while Nicoletta grows into the role of the Lady of the Palazzo. ",5.0
" What an excellent book. Great use of characters and character growth. The chracters are revealed slowly in layers. Multidimensional supporting characters. There are a pair of young girls that are so well created you can hear the russle of their gowns and the patter of their feet running down the palazzo's corridors. A mystery that grows slowly throughout the book. Wonderful sense of the time and place. I have cried 3 times while reading this book.The level of mystery and intrigue reminds me of her Ghostwalker series which has the same depth of conspiracy interwoven into the romance.This is certainly one of Christine Feehan's defining works.

" The Scarletti Curse is absolutely wonderful. Ms. Feehan once again created a lively well written work that stand far apart from her Dark series (which I also adore). With complex and dark characters this book has quite a lot of bite and more than enough romance for a true fan of Christine's work. I highly recommend this book for one and all. ",5.0
" If you're a fan of Christine Feehan you already know some of the elements you'll find in this book - beautiful courageous spirited heroine and strong intelligent handsome tortured hero. Christine Feehan has put these elements in play in such exciting ways in her Dark series that she's raised the bar incredibly for Paranormal romance. It's hard to picture anyone writing about noble vampire-like creatures in a more exciting sensuous just flat out stunning way. This book though not about the vampire-like beings in her others adds an exciting Gothic twist to Christine's writing and a clever mystery to her incredibly involving characterizations. The suspenseful ending is very exciting and the reader is not sure until the end how the book will resolve. I particularly loved Nicoletta's free-spirited naturalist perspective; her grounded innocence makes such a compelling counterpoint to Don Scarletti's cursed magnificence. I own every Christine Feehan book and recommend them ALL. This is a fitting addition to her wonderful writing. ",5.0

Problem with wanting to marry her is all the women his family has chosen for their brides ends up dead. But he is not going to let that stop him from getting Nicoletta.

" I have read almost all of Ms. Feehan's books but I think this has become one of my favorites. I was kind of hesitant to buy it because it wasn't part of the Dark Series and I wasn't sure I'd like it. Once I saw the price though I decided to take a chance. After reading the first chapter I knew my worries were TOTALLY unfounded. I was hooked! And to my surprise the story is about an ancestor of Antonietta Scarletti (the female lead of 'Dark Symphony'). I could NOT put it down! I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys romance novels or anyone who likes a good read. ",5.0

" While I am not usually a fan of books where the hero is overly domineering I must concede that Christine Feehan writes so well that I enjoy her novels even though the men are so controlling and obsessive it would be frightening in real life.'The Scarletti Curse' is not a part of the Carpathian series but I found myself enjoying it as much if not more. The heroine is a healer but in a time where she could be burned at the stake should this secret gift be discovered. In order to protect herself she pretends to be a healers apprentice. Unfortunately the one man she wishes to hide this talent from Giovanni Scarletti is not fooled.Like much of Feehan's work the story is very gothic in feel and the villain(s) are truly horrible. While the hero is constantly swooping in and saving the heroine it becomes more of a joke between the two of them than a tiresome what-a-stupid-girl scenario.I was leary of this novel after being dissappointed with 'Lair of the Lion.' This novel is much much better. If you like her Carpathian series or are interested in paranormal romance this is a good book to read. ",5.0
" No female whether they are of the blood or through marriage survives THE SCARLETTI CURSE. They all violently die. One of the villagers Nicoletta knows first hand that her own mother was a victim of the curse. Still she lives life to the fullest and uses her abilities to heal people. Her guardian helps hide the secret that Nicoletta has empathic talents by fostering the idea she is just the village healer to keep her safe from Giovanni Scarletti.However the kind Nicoletta helps cure ailing lass suffering from dining on a contaminated meal with her uncle Giovanni. He immediately realizes that Nicoletta is his life mate and will protect her from his enemies but will his need to keep her safe end up making him follow the footsteps of his ancestors who loved so deep they killed for love?Though there is a political sidebar that adds suspense to the tale this gothic story line belongs to the two lead characters. Nicoletta is the classic heroine willing to do the right thing even at the cost of her own life. Giovanni is the dark brooding alpha male wanting to also do the right thing for his people and especially his beloved. Toss on top of the key theme a bit of the paranormal and readers have Christine Feehan's intrepid venture outside the Carpathian realm (see her 'Dark' series) into a totally different sub-genre that proves she is a versatile talent who deserves a wide readership.Harriet Klausner ",5.0
" The ancient dons worshipped the old gods honoring their pagan heritage and building the palazzo in defiance of the Holy Church. Two centuries ago the Scarletti family was cursed and now for years there have been rumors of murders and assignations. Indeed the palazzo itself feels evil to sensitive Nicoletta a woman who is known to be 'different' in her gifts to heal to listen to the wind to sense danger. So when the mesmerizing Don Scarletti chooses her to be his bride Nicoletta knows every bride who entered the palazzo is doomed.Nicoletta roamed the hills surrounding her village before the don's choice of her curtailed her activities to the palazzo. She had sworn no man would command her but when she fled her home to hide the don followed her luring her with his own gift. The don's darkly sensual voice erotic and seductive entices her imagination and her womanhood linking her to the man she would flee.Don Scarletti knows well the dangers that lurk upon his land. Political upheaval and family secrets threaten the woman he takes as wife as well as the others dependent upon him. He carefully guards his own gifts from others than his chosen bride. Only Nicoletta can reach through his icy aloofness to the passionate man concealed within.As a new comer to Christine Feehan's work I had very high expectations based on other reader's reactions and I am not disappointed. Written with a sensuous style a deep understanding for history and a respect for both Christianity and Paganism THE SCARLETTI CURSE contains a fast paced plot and dynamic characterizations. All the classic gothic elements keep the pages turning including the dark castle with gargoyles warnings from natural elements portents from ravens secret passageways family secrets and multiple dead wives. Further the strong heroine isn't too perfect; the troubled hero still maintains his strength amid his human failings while the gothic elements lend the perfect depth and shadow. Very highly recommended. ",5.0
" From the back of the book...Strange twisted cravings and hideous gargoyles adorned the palazzo of the great Scarletti family. But a still more fearful secret lurked within its storm-tossed turrets. For every bride who entered its forbidding walls was doomed to leave in a casket.Mystical and unfettered Nicoletta had no terror of ancient curses and no fear of marriage...until she looked into the dark mesmerizing eyes of Don Scarletti. She had sworn no man would command her had thought her gift of healing set her apart but his was the right to choose a bride from among his people. And he had chosen her.Compelled by duty drawn by desire she gave her body into his keeping and prayed the powerful tormented Don would be her heart's destiny and not her soul's demise. ",5.0
" I continue to love the work of Ms Feehan. She is a wonderful storyteller. Her books never seem to get old and tired.Giovanni and Nicolette come together to make a wonderful love story. They are both 'different' in a world were those differences could get them burned at the stake. Giovanni can read and talk to peoples minds. Nicolette has the ability to heal with her hands. They come together over a child's sick bed.Giovanni realizes that Nicolette is the women he has been dreaming about and is determine to marry her. She is his light in the darkness that seems to surround him and his family.Nicolette is a free spirit that runs around in bare feet. Raising plants for medicine and enjoying her freedom. She always seems to be in trouble.This is a warm and wonderful story that everyone should read. ",5.0

" Hawthorne's gentle charming collection of classic myths retold for the children of his day is a neglected classic. Addressing the reader in personable Victorian fashion his prose is clear and beautiful. Consider this sample",5.0
" Once upon a time (I was about 8) a family friend handed down his Collier's Junior Classic series to me - each volume is a glorious hodgepodge of short stories from here there and everywhere. I got to be very fond of Greek mythology especially 'The Chimaera' and 'The Miraculous Pitcher' since the Collier retellings of their respective legends were much more lively than the ordinary.Alas I forgot the name of the author of 'The Chimaera' and even that my favourite versions of the myths were all written by the same person. Some talented guy writing for the series no doubt I would have said if I'd thought about it. A couple of years ago I started browsing through an impressive-looking illustrated volume of mythology in a bookstore (which you now see before you). Whoa. 'Scarlet Letter' Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote *THESE*?His retellings of Greek myths were originally spread over 2 volumes (the other being _Tanglewood Tales_) but they can be obtained in a single volume these days. I can personally do without the gang of Tanglewood kids providing the official audience for the stories-within-a-story or the defense against critics put into the mouth of the storyteller Eustace Bright but then I want more space for more myths. ",5.0
" One day last week I could not even after hours of deliberation (the snow had made engagements scarce) decide what book to read next. I finally came upon this little volume on the end of my parent's bookshelf and decided to give it try. How could I have known what charms were in store? I felt like a little girl again and as Eustace Bright the ambitious college student who narrates these tales held his little auditors in awe my eyes too were wide with wonder. It truly is a 'wonder book' full of high fantasy thrilling action and the inimitable imagery of a master. Though geared towards 'boys and girls' Hawthorne explains in his introduction that 'children possess an unestimated sensibility to whatever is deep or high in imagination or feeling so long as it is simple . . . It is only the artificial and complex that bewilder them.' Indeed; the book hardly condescends and so will gently stretch the middle-grader's vocabulary. But readers -- or listeners -- of all ages will delight in this collection of tales for I was equally if not more entertained by the introductories and postludes to each story which relate the antics and dialogue of Eustace and the little children he entertains. These interludes also expand the stories by slipping in commentary and interpretation.Don't pass this one by; it will truly win your heart whoever you may be! ",5.0
" I ordered this book as part of a third grade curriculum for my son. These Everyman titles are really wonderful-- beautiful binding heavy pages amazing illustrations. I was not disappointed with this book. It is the kind of book we will read again and again and hopefully pass on to the next generation. Hawthorne's rendition of the myths and fables is classic and engaging and Rackham's illustrations are worth the price on their own. ",5.0
" If you've read Hawthorne's longer works you might be surprised by the storytelling fun and energy he puts into this shorter book aimed at boys and girls of all ages 8 to 80 who love a good yarn. Imagine yourself on a whispery wintery day sledding on the hillsides with friends. Or imagine yourself gathered with the kids on the front porch on a golden summery afternoon. Now add to these settings Hawthorne's inventive narrator Eustace Bright who gathers the children round on that hillside or porch and gives them the classic myths with his own unique spins.If you think you know the stories of King Midas and his golden touch of Hercules' exploits of Medusa you have here the chance to rediscover them in child-friendly yet fully adventurous form through the skills of Mr. Nathaniel Hawthorne. He gives the old tales a lot of charm makes them palatable for younger kids and weaves in lessons of ethics and morality and courage. I have always appreciated Hawthorne's more thought-provoking writings but here I find another side to the man and the writer that is magical and light. To add to the wonder I not only have the paperback version but also read this in an e-book format enjoying the beautiful drawings of Arthur Rackham.I've long been a fan of Hawthorne's short stories. While he plays out some amazing themes and characters in 'A Scarlet Letter' 'House of the Seven Gables' and even 'The Blithedale Romance' he excels in his shorter tales where the prose has less room to run off track and the themes are better addressed. He seems serious in most of his writing with only hints of his humor and playfulness but in 'A Wonder Book for Boys and Girls' we find a side of Hawthorne that's hard not to adore. ",5.0

It's the the perfect size for kids ages 4-9 years old to do their homework or other projects.

" Impressive quality. Solid wood really nicely evenly stained wood with excellent layout clear instructions and very nicely packaged parts for assembly. A beautiful set. My daughter (almost 6yrs old) is going to be amazed when she sees it in the place where her old/antiquated art table used to be.Another selling point is the customer service at KidKraft. I noted that the overall quality and finish was really great except for one piece of the front of the hutch which was pretty good but had an imperfection that was filled in with well-colormatched well-sanded wood filler. My daughter would not have noticed it but it bothered me. I decided to call customer service an 800 number to see if they'd have any opinion on it. I figured they'd explain that wood is wood is never perfect that kind of thing is within tolerances et cetera... but before I even finished describing the issue the very kind rep (a live person who answered on the first ring - wow!) was asking me for my shipping address apologizing and stating they'd get a perfect piece out to me right away. She told me to go ahead and assemble the pieces that I had then when the new piece comes just swap it in without even dealing with sending back to them the imperfect piece. Just like that. Done. Instead of me apologizing and pleading my case SHE was apologizing and stated that she would personally make sure that I'd be satisfied.Amazing. ",5.0
" This item arrived well packed and undamaged. It looks exactly like the picture was fairly easy to assemble and is sturdy and well made. Of course it is an 'assembly required' piece of furniture but once put together it looks like a really nice quality piece. My daughter loves it. It is sized for a child and is too small for an adult. I think she'll be able to use it through age 11 or 12. It also has a convenient hole in the back of the hutch for her computer wire to poke through. I looked at this item EVERYWHERE including eBay and Amazon was the cheapest of all. The chair comes included so don't buy an extra chair separately! ",5.0

It is a great size for our 3 and 5 year old and I believe will fit them well for many more years. My wife just started homeschooling our 5 year old and the desk works great. Very stable you'll love it. We have no complaints at all. Some of the information as far as heights go is a little confusing in the description. The top of the desk is just shy of 24' and the top of the hutch is just shy of 30'. As far as the chair goes the seat itself is about 14' so it is all sized quite well for your little ones. They don't have to sit on thier knees to work at their desk. You can't go wrong with this one. And you will not find a better bargian.

" This desk is definitely worth the money. My daughter wanted a white desk with a hutch and had picked out many over [...] not including the chair. I ordered this one without her knowing and at first she was upset because the hutch is not that big. But once it was assembled she loves it. She is 8 and loves the little cubbies in the hutch. Everything is packaged nicely and there was not one scratch or ding or funny smells. The hardware had everything you needed (no extras) in separate baggies for the chair and desk. I put it together myself in about 1 hour. We did replace the knob with a blue glass knob from the hardware store just to make it a little more unique I guess and it looks great. With free supersaver shipping and no sales tax there is no better buy out there. Trust me I have looked! ",5.0

We did change the knob (the knob it came with was a simple wooden knob. Not horrible but for a couple of dollars at the hardware store you can get a beautiful knob.)

" I purchased this desk for my 7-year old grandson and while it wasn't the most exciting Christmas present he received it was probably one of the most practical (which is why I gave it a low score on 'fun'). It's a very nice piece of furniture and appears to be very sturdy. He loves having all his 'stuff' for school in one place and is now able to do his homework in the peace and quiet of his room. The desk appeared a little larger than we had envisioned (knowing the dimensions doesn't quite prepare you for the actual 'impact' of the item in the room) but it ended up fitting quite nicely in his room. I would say that after an average-size child reaches age nine or ten this desk would be too small. ",5.0

" When I think of Heart's 1985 self-titled album I feel it should be renamed 'Resurgence'! Meaning this was their 'comeback' album after what everyone thought they were just wilting and fading away several years earlier. It seems like when Heart was popular with 'Dreamboat Annie' ten years earlier they were on top to stay. However when the 1980s began many rock artists were forgotten and to never be heard from again. Not Heart! Sure they were lost in the early 80s because of the MTV explosion and the world was living on 'Thriller'. Capitol's bold gamble paid off",5.0
" In 1985Heart made their Capitol Records debut with their self-titled album. The band themselves debuted in 1976 on Epic. They were dropped from Epic in 1983following the release of PASSIONWORKS. Bass guitarist Mark Andes was a member of the disbanded Firefallwhose hits included JUST REMEMBER I LOVE YOU and YOU ARE THE WOMAN. Now for the songs",5.0
" This is the best Heart album ever made in my opinion. I grew up listening to Heart and I still listen to them. I saw Ann and Nancy in concert last year they were awsome as usual. My favorite song is 'These Dreams'. Another good song is 'What About Love'. Heart has had numerous #1 hits and it's amazing people still love to listen to them. ",5.0
" I liked this album since it debuted. The radio stations in Chicago played the hell out of the singles. 9 good songs. The only one I didn't care for is ' What He Don't Know'.Ann was gaining alot of weight around this time and in the video's her body is blocked by props on stage or the camera zooms in for jsut head shots of her singing. She's still got a strong powerful voice. ",5.0
" I honestly think that the first song I ever heard was either 'If Looks Could Kill' or 'What About Love'. At the time I would've only been two or three but my older brother and sister had this record. I stole it from one of them and ever since Heart has been my favorite band of all time. This album is without a doubt their best work ever. The only slight weak spot being 'Nobody Home' but it's still a good song. It just doesn't fit the album very well. Ann's voice is raw and ethereal and the way Nancy plays the guitar is too great for words. So if you love this kind of music. Then you must have this record in your collection.Also Recommended",5.0
" In late 1984 after Ann Wilson had success with Mike Reno (lead singer of Loverboy) on their duet 'Almost Paradise' for the 1984 film 'Footloose' Heart regrouped with Ann Wilson Nancy Wilson Howard Leese Mark Andes and Denny Carmassi to start recording another album. Their last two albums had flopped and they had decided to go in another direction",5.0
" This is the album that brought Heart back on top of the scene. They scored many top ten hits here and there first number one hit 'These Dreams'. I personally think this is there best work to date and has some of the best songs on it. 'Never' is my favorite song on the album. I am not a huge Heart fan so it does not bother me as much they sold out but as long as they made good music it doesn't really matter. i recommend this album as Heart's best album to date. ",5.0
" Heart was back and bigger than ever. 'Heart' was a last ditch effort to keep the band together. If it failed Heart would no longer exist. Well history shows what happened.MTV made four videos for this album and they made Nancy Wilson every teenager's dream girl. Ann was always my favorite sister and she looked real good too. MTV milked this album for all it was worth and Heart was now an official '80's band' like it or not. This album brought a breath of life into their career that seemed to be standing still.Besides the singles I always liked 'The Wolf' but 'Shell Shock' was by far the hardest loudest most rockin' tune on the whole album.

" What The Cure was to new wave/punk Heart was to rock n' roll. These songs overflowed with all the passion excitement romance and love that typical meat and potatoes male rockstars of the era felt too embarrassed to express. On this album Heart is easy listening hard rock and progressive new wave pop all at the same time. There's an excellent balance of guitar and synth with thrillingly uplifting moments and heart-melting ballads. The Wilson sister's vocals are lush throughout but what really stands out are the songs themselves.'If Looks Could Kill' is a solid dramatic rocker. 'What About Love' is a dynamic ballad that features Grace Slick on backround vocals. Howard Leese lays a fine guitar solo. The last half minute pulsates double time with unbelievable excitement and conviction. You'll continue to hear the song in your head even after you turn off your stereo. 'Never' is sexy and serious at the same time.Written by Bernie Taupin 'These Dreams' has to be among the very best ballads of the 80's. This is Heart at its most romantic and seductive. It's medieval lyrical imagery gives it a timeless appeal. The song emblazons a gorgeous fantasy world upon your emotions. It's a better four minutes than any drug could ever give you.'The Wolf' uses primal imagry to put down the unwanted advances of sleazy guys. It's guitar solo will floor you with a determined and indomitable hopefullness! 'All Eyes' scores again with an alternately sexy seductiveness and lovestruck passion. 'You don't have to say a word to get a hold of me/take me...shake me/Burning gravity baby/Look at me look at me'. What guy wouldn't love to hear those words from his girlfriend? And there's another triumphant guitar solo that's brimming with happiness. The plaintive ballad 'Nobody Home' is beautiful.'Nothin' At All' has a pure pop genius. It's got that top of the world 80's happiness to it. The guitar solo is simple yet very satisfying. The almost country 'What He Don't Know' is a decent soft rock ballad. The closer 'Shell Shock' is a bit cheesy but displays an ample pop rock sensibility.This album is very happy warm and hopefull. But unlike the shallowness of most pop music it's happy in a deep and meaningful way. When you feel like the daily grind has bled away your passion this album is the antidote. ",5.0
" If there was a recording or type of music that represents the music of my life it would be mid-'80s Heart music. This music affected me more than any other recordings I ever bought. I have never listened to a recording so many times as I did this 1985 release after buying it.It's a high-powered rock recording with power ballads mixed in. I saw a Heart arena stage show in NorfolkVA in September of 1985 and may lightning strike me dead if I am not 101% honest in saying that I have never been so stunned impressed blown away awestruck mesmerizedor captivated by anything in life like I was by Ann Wilson's lightning bolt performance and stupendously glorified stage appearance along with Heart's incredible stage energy and unmatched professionalism in the live execution of this 1985 recording.Every song on here is good. Too bad there isn't a DVD of Heart's 1985 music. Over twenty years ago this recording came out and I am still so profoundly affected by this recording & Heart's 1985 show. Ann & Nancy really struck gold recording these songs and their live `85 performance put me in a state of awe that I never felt before or after this show. I have never been thrilled like that by anything ever! Heart's 1985 recording is more than just music to me it was an unforgettable life experience that's part of me forever. This CD is a memory picture of that experience.Hopefully a Heart 1985 CD will come out that has bonus mid 1980s songs on it (like 'Love Takes Over' which is on youtube as of 2011). I still have the cassette for this recording and can attest that this cd sounds like instruments are missing or severely faded especially on 'If Looks Could Kill.' Something isn't right with the process that put this recording on a cd. ",5.0
" I can't remember the last time I read such a dire book. I howled with laughter all the way through wondering how much worse it could get - and sure enough it got worse. If the writing is bad the plot is ludicrous. A preacher comes to offer condolences the same afternoon that the heroine's husband is shot dead. Within moments they are having sex. The sex is not sensually treated or beautifully described - no all they do is stick their tongues down each other's throats. The preacher goes to tell his paralysed wife. Her bizarre response - wait for it - is to stick her tongue down his throat. No wonder he veers away. The heroine runs off to work in the heart of Liverpool in a rose garden ten miles long (I kid you not). Did I mention she is dying? But never mind she'll make a miraculous recovery. She meets another man - even though conveniently he's dying too and she's pregnant by the preacher by now (and oh joy she hears the heartbeat of the fetus at a week... truly a miracle)! The other man lives in castle and is very rich. Of course. They consumate their affair when she sticks her tongue down his throat. Not to worry she doesn't have to perform this crude tonsil-tickling for long. The preacher turns up again. Everyone in the way drops dead leaving the coast free for the 'wicked saints' of the title to romp without blame or shame into the sunset.I could have kicked myself for buying this book; but I had been fooled by reading a mention of it by a so-called reviewer of The Mermaid Chair (which is a good book.) Then I checked all the other reviews done by reviewers of Ms Haddon's book (you can click on 'other reviews' to see what I mean) and believe I have spotted a scam. The reviewers appear to have chosen the same half dozen best sellers to review -- each on the same day! - and in each review of these other genuinely good books they mention Wicked Saints in the most glowing terms. This is cynical piggy-back riding on bona fide books made worse because this is a very badly edited (and badly written) self published book. I hope few people will be fooled as I was - and as Amazon has been. Be warned! ",1.0

" The topic explored by the author is the practice of forgery in late Antiquity to substantiate a religious cult's legitimacy. As a revised version of the author's doctoral thesis and his first book it has page after page of unnecessary excerpts whose sole purpose seems to be to let the reader know that the author really has passed his language proficiency exams. These are then followed an apology trying to explain why they really were worth quoting. It is a very boring read. Besides these stylistic annoyances the entire structure of the book takes the form of a survey of various instances of pseudepigrapha... which are then dutifully stretched back to the initial lackluster thesis. There are no fantastic insights in this book. Unless you are doing a specialization in this field I would not recommend buying this book. There are many better books in the study of religion to be savored. If you must have it for a specialization I would recommend finding it at a university library... though it may have a limited availability since it is only a revamped standard doctoral thesis that is not widely applicable in many areas of study.

" I absolutely couldn't stand this book!I'm not understanding how it's sexy for a woman to give up her friends and life for a guy who wishes to control her completely. The Don was a jerk. Nicoletta is an awesome heroine in the beginning but turns into a submissive wifey thing by the end. It's a sad thing when a woman to paraphrase an actually part of Nicoletta's thoughts 'leaves her old life behind because he'll never like it and because she just HAS to'. Eeeeew.I loved the Dark series and constantly used to stalk the bookstore waiting for the next one. This one was the beginning of the end of my love for Ms. Feehan's work. I bought it to tide me over from one Dark book to the next and it made me so angry that I wrote the author and got into a big argument over the book!Please please please...read something in the Dark series or Emma Holly's Upyr series.

" I have read all of the Carpathian novels to date except one. I very much enjoyed them at first but nothing EVER gets resolved. You would think that after 16 books something would have been resolved and a new obstacle introduced. As for this book it is an off-shoot of another Carpathian novel about the Jaguar Line. I was hoping to find out more about this curse the origins and why the males kill the females. Nothing not a word about the Jaguar curse. And why do the walls and ceilings change? Ideas introduced and left at that. Ms. Feehan went once again off on a tagent. Her books become less and less meaty and more and more expensive. I will NOT be buying any further books by this author. What a shame. ",1.0

" The physics department at my school gets the mad ramblings of this man and I usually end up with them (seeing as how no one else will read them). In a word I sum these writings as 'nonsense.' Most of his ideas aside from being mostly incoherant and physically absurd also defy the time-tested and true concepts that the average high-school physics student could debunk. Furthermore mixed in with these insane babblings are religious and political ramblings which he tries to pass off as the only possible truth.My recommendation unless you want a good laugh or evidence of the under-education of many Americans pass on this book. Any other use of your money would be a better one. ",1.0
" I bought this CD for one song only 'Steal Away'. I knew it was going to be 'live' but this isn't even close to the radio version. Try more like a 'muzik lounge' sound. It was recorded in a ballroom. Then the only other song I recognized was 'Hot Rod Hearts' again done the Vegas lounge style. I wish I could get my $$ back. Why didn't he just put out the CD using the regular recordings? He was never a big star to begin with. I wrote this review just to warn people that it isn't like most 'live' recordings.

So why did i personally find this so painfull?Well the whole thing in general is quite painfull. First off the musicians. The whole band sound like studio musicians. No obvious indivuality or anything new to offer. Then we get to the vocals. The closest thing I can compare them to are Alison Moyet or Anthony and the johnsons. I don't mind Anthony and the Johnsons but this guys vocals and the music just don't rock. Which is fine. It's ok not to rock! But why the hell being a Tool fan and Mars volta fan was I recomended this? It's bland it's week and the dubby bass boring guitar playing/sound... weak vocals.. Actually forget it. The whole package.

" Lewis Keel is a music teacher in the New York public school system and while my hat's off to him for devoting his life to this worthy profession I have to say that he sounds like a high school musician. Having been a high school saxophonist myself I can honestly say I recognize talent when I hear it and it isn't heard in high school bands very often.He has the technical skills to get around the instrument as he adequately demonstrates on 'Day by Day' and 'Anthropology' but he has no real touch or feeling for what he's playing. Moreover he's prone to squeaks and squawks a la the kids who play woodwinds in public school bands. Maybe I'm just tired of hearing some of the old stand-bys like 'Love for Sale' and 'Lover Come Back to Me' but if so Lewis Keel is contributing to it. His treatment of 'Quiet Nights' is about as clinical as it gets a style I would call 'Bossa Snora.'I'm sorry Lewis. I know you're probably a good man but stick to teaching and stay out of the recording studio. ",1.0

" If you can read the above lines out loud with a straight face you just might be able to take Max Brand's Donnegan seriously. The novel has several weaknesses but the one that turns it into a spectacular failure is its ludicrous framing story.Donnegan a short red-haired tramp rides the rails in search of a man named Rusty Dick (please no snickering). Having discovered that his quarry is dead Donnegan jumps off the train forces his way into a stranger's house and falls in love with the owner's daughter on the spot. The owner one Colonel Macon sends Donnegan with his daughter to the Corner a mining town hoping that the girl will win back her lover Jim Landis from the shadowy Lord Nick who has horned in on the Colonel's profitable business arrangements with Landis. Failing that Donnegan is to kill Landis.This nearly intolerable beginning then gives place to a fairly good second act; the Corner turns out to be an interesting place with interesting characters. Donnegan wins himself an ally a giant black fighting man named George Washington Green while the beautiful scheming Nelly Lebrun proves a formidable obstacle to Donnegan. Jim Landis proves to be no opponent at all but a mere human football whom the real players are fighting to possess.Donnegan's character gets more fleshed out in the second act. As in Destry Rides Again Max Brand shows a talent for portraying a hero who is severely and obviously flawed - lazy an almost pathological liar perpetually needing to prove his manhood - yet nonetheless lovable for that. Indeed Donnegan is so flawed that the story seems to be inevitably heading for a tragic denouement that might redeem the absurdity of the first act.Unfortunately there's no such luck. Almost from the minute the shadowy Lord Nick walks on the stage (his true identity should surprise no one) the story careers off into utter absurdity again. The characters' motivations none too credible to begin with now contort into self-parody. Don't feel bad if you can make no sense whatsoever out of the last few chapters; everybody including the characters themselves is just as confused as you are.Unlike many later Western authors many of whom preferred to tiptoe around the question of racism Max Brand places race relations front and center in this novel even more than in Destry Rides Again. This time we get a clearer picture of what Brand's own racial attitudes were",1.0

" Don't buy this game because you will forever wonder why you did so. This is the worst racing game I have ever played. The bonus games are crap and are all the same thing. If this was even a decent game there would be a reason to play the bonus games. But there's not. Sure you get money but with the best car in the game fully upgraded (why did I waste my time) you can't tell a difference in the race from a crap car. All the upgrades do is take your money and waste your time.The actual racing is just as bad. Sometimes when you hit a cone you will keep right on going and even get extra in your boost gauge. Other times I have gone flying off the track because of a single cone. I don't know why and at this point I really don't care.The races beyond the very first ones are way too difficult. It is more luck than skill. In other words there is almost no way to get first and you will only get in the top 3 if the other players take themselves out. Computer cars beat the best and fully upgraded car off the line and can turn corners in about half the time without losing speed. All you can do is watch them drive away.Oh and one last thing the shortcuts suck. They are not shortcuts and usually end up taking longer because it is like threading a needle and with the handling being so bad. If you even stray a little from the exact route you will be out of bounds and have to reset. If you hit anything even going very slow you will be thrown from your car and lose time. If you do manage to do it right you might still come out behind where you were. I have only found 3 races out of 75 or whatever it is that actually have a shortcut that is worth taking. And by worth taking I mean doesn't lose you time and doesn't gain it either. Talk about a crap game. Please consider not buying this game.Bottom line",1.0

" I purchased this thermometer because we wanted an accurate thermometer and were tired of the generic drug store thermometers. We definitely need to be provided an accurate on spot temp due to my daughters health issues. I was super excited to receive this thermometer right away!!! Shipping was GREAT! I opened it read the manual and then took her temp ( knowing she was hot ) it said 98.8. I pulled out our old thermometer and it registered 100.4 THIS IS AN ISSUE! I thought maybe it was just this one time and tried it again later that evening knowing she was still running a fever. It read 99.9 old thermometer read 100.9. YET AGAIN AN ISSUE!!! I continued to try both thermometers the next day while she still had a temp and STILL had the same large variation in temps. My husband decided to call the company. No answer no answering service. He called WelchAllyn since we had no response from the Medical Supply Company. They asked if we purchased this thermometer in June? He said ummm no we just bought it 5 days ago. The associate said well this thermometer is registered as being purchased in June and we aren't sure if this Medical Supply company is a registered seller of these WelchAllyn thermometers. They are having a supervisor call us tomorrow. We called the Medical supply company yet again and finally had someone answer unfortunately they seem like they could care less about the fact that it is not working and they definitely do not care that this could have been previously owned and returned. They told us there is a 15% restocking fee for returning it unless WelchAllyn says it was previously owned. WHAT!!! So they don't know if they are selling items that are previously owned and obviously faulty? The associate at WelchAllyn said this may have been returned due to being faulty and now is being sold as 'New' through this company. THIS IS RIDICULOUS CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SALES SERVICE!!!! These thermometers may be PREVIOUSLY OWNED AND USED AND BEING SOLD AS 'NEW'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will update this as soon as a I speak with a supervisor tomorrow! ",1.0
" This was the first book I've read by Jamaica Kincaid and it will be my last.This book was not only BAD it was depressing. Xuela didn't loved anyone because no one loved her. She was a bitter and angry person. The line 'I did not know my mother because she died at the moment of my birth' was repeated about 100 times throughout the book.I don't know why the book was named 'Autobiography of my Mother' because she never knew her mother and constantly throughout the book said so. She hated her father because he was in a position of 'power' and took advantage of others. One other thing that bothered me about this book was her habit of touching her private parts in public and smelling her hands after. I found this hard to believe that Xuela would be so 'free' in Dominica at the time period in this book. Touching ones self is taboo among most black people whether you're born in Africa America or the West Indies.The only interesting part about this book is when her lover's wife confronted her in the street.Maybe if the book wasn't written in such a 'defeated and depressing' way it would have been better but the author's tone contridicts Xuela's 'I-don't-care-about-anyone' attitude. Xuela stated she was content or happy with herself but the tone didn't suggest that at all. ",1.0

She repeats the same few thoughts throughout the entire book. She reminds the reader that her mother is dead and that nobody loves her so many times that I stopped caring about her situation. Her repetition and monotone voice stops the narrator from being truly developed as a character that we can connect with. Some parts of her story seem unnecessary and pointless as they don't really lead to anything of interest later on. Her characterization was too direct and left nothing for the reader to consider for themselves. The title is extremely misleading as we learn absolutely nothing about her mother- aside from her death during childbirth. I am unable to find anything positive to describe about this book sadly.

" There are plenty of tension rods out there. The _only_ advantage of the Umbra rods is that they look better. (Why other manufacturers haven't figured out the design part is anybody's guess.) The problem with the Umbra rods -- all of them -- is NO tension. I have tried these repeatedly.... Why? Because my local hardware store carries them and they are readily available elsewhere and I have opted for form over function. Every single Umbra rod I have used fails drastically. They simply cannot bear any weight. Or to put it differently they cannot exert enough force against the surfaces they extend out to for them to bear any load. Worse the springs that are the key element in sustaining the tension tend to fail. When those springs fail anything you have suspended by the rod will come down.

" Three or four years back I wrote a screenplay about a Marine who comes back from IRAQ. He is struggling to adapt to civilian life and hold onto his relationship with his wife when she is abducted in a bank robbery.As his life crumbles and the police seem less interested in recovering his wife he goes the vigilante route tracking interrogating and diving into dangerous situations ultimately leading him to Las Vegas where he uncovers a large scale plot that is bigger than he or anyone could ever imagine.Other than the fact that my script is more complex and has better dialogue the biggest difference between my script and THE MARINE is that the lead character in my script is REAL. A real flesh and blood human being Marine with vulnerabilities emotions and he actually bleeds. He's a real person like somebody you might know from your town who went to Iraq.While THE MARINE'S John Triton (John Cena) is bulletproof explosion proof dives through walls unscratched hangs onto semi-trucks while it drives through buildings and despite the bombardment of boards pipes and tin sheets he rolls off and groans before jumping up and kicking more butt. Not to mention I don't think a scene goes by that he doesn't remind everybody that he's a Marine and it's the only thing he knows. By the way the tin sheets would have severed him easily.Oh and of course the name Triton is appropriate to refer to John Cena as a Greek God or the largest moon of Neptune.Ridiculous is an understatement. This movie insults our intelligence with a symplistic unrealistic poorly written story. Deplorable acting from all involved. Was this movie trying to be a comedy? The jewl thieves are idiots and are more concerned with trying to be comedic than to try to come up with a plan to escape.The real shame is that my script is pretty well useless now.

Unfortunately hollywood big wigs have put their MONEY behind THE MARINE a silly poorly written poorly thought out poorly acted piece of junk.You need more than dozens of unrealistic and over-the-top explosions to grab this reviewer.

" This film is complete and total garbage i mean its really bad. John plays a Marine who gets kicked out of the Corps after defying orders to save the lives of some Marines. I wont even get into that rats nest of crap. So he is discharged from the Marines and is trying to start working a civilian job. While on a road trip with his wife some people who robbed a jewelery store and happened to stop at the same gas station end up kidnapping his wife and begins his outrageously stupid and ill scripted pursuit. Fact is John was able to track his targets through the marsh and swamp while quite often they were on a road. The thought process that i have would be is that they could take any back road/dirt road or anything that connect to the main road they would be gone and he would be heading in the completely wrong direction. However somehow he is always able to find the bad guys. My biggest complain is that it is a movie about a Marine and he never really uses a gun he takes them and never uses them. I think the person who wrote it doesn't realize that every Marine is a rifleman and i cannot think of one who wouldn't use a gun to protect his wife. This movie is your standard WWE/WWF film that solves everything with hand to hand combat scenes. I mean come on if i would of wanted to watch a fighting movie then that is what i would've bought. However i bought a movie titled MARINE i fully expect there to be FIREFIGHTS and shooting. That is what really irritates me along with the pathetic acting is that it doesn't make sense. Marines are trained to use guns but this guy doesn't seem to use them even when his wife is in danger.I'm not really sure i can convey to you how bad this movie is.It would be a good film for people who prefer hand to hand combat and like movies with really bad acting and holes in the plot so big you can drive a semi truck threw them.This movie starts out bad and just gets worse and worse.Horrible Movie 1/5 stars.

" I gave this movie a chance because Robert Patrick was in it. He couldn't give it any justice at all. The action was over the top and unrealistic. The criminals were all cliched especially the African-American criminal. (Don't know why they always have to make African-American characters have a smart mouth it's too stereotypical) John Cena can't act his way out of a paper bag and he's too damn bulky with his cucumber fingers. The car chase scene with all them bullets hitting the car and Cena is still driving and able to avoid every single bullet. He's hit with multiple objects but still no mark on him. The wife gets knocked the hell out so many times but no bruise on her at all. This movie was ridiculous don't waste your time unless you're a Cena mark. ",1.0
" Now The Marine doesn't try to be a good movie it lets you know right from the beginning what it is going to be. A huge muscleman marine is told to wait for the rest of the soldiers on a mission. He says 'not enough time' and charges in to blow things up. Next scene he is being discharged and has to go find a job as a security guard. This is all in the first 2 minutes of the movie. The thing that really bothered me about the movie was that everything that went on really had no point and did not make a difference later in the film. That isn't the only thing they weren't able to complete not by a long shot. The bad guys have this big black guy on their side and he is not unfunny they just don't give him anything funny to say. I seriously think that he didn't complete a single joke. In fact the liquid metal guy from Terminator 2 stars as the main bad guy and they even throw in a reference to that and it was the only joke they actually completed. I thought that it was the least bad part of the movie.Now the reason I went to see this was becasue I was told it had great fights. The shootouts were nice to look at and the explosions became so repetitious I almost fell asleep but the fights were once again just the same old I hit you and then you hit me style. The best fight of the movie included 2 characters who were never explained and this scene could have been from entirely different film for all I know. So if you are looking for the worst big budget movie of the year then check this out. ",1.0
" You really have to give it up to wrestling promoter Vince McMahon. He has failed miserably with the WBF XFL and programs on MTV & he couldn't sell a quality meal in New York City. So Vince now tries that magic business touch in the film industry. Huh?It appears that Vince has just a little jealousy towards 'The Rock' Dwayne Johnson and his great success making movies to the point where he doesn't need to do any bumps for the WWE and the McMahon family. Granted Vince receives a nice sum of cash for Johnson's wrestling moniker to be used for movies but that just isn't enough.And where Johnson has long-since passed up the 1980s-styled superhero genre here comes Vince lumbering along in his powerwalk with his answer to The Rock John Cena. Yes that John Cena who was going to be a hip-hop star; until he proved that he has no hip and zero hop in his mic skills.But have a script comparable with Sylvester Stallone's ridiculous Rambo character - with Cena's mannerisms that could be termed as the nephew to the fictional tough-guy - blow all kinds of things up and Vince is in business. Hardly.The first weekend in theaters October 13-15 2006 The Marine did a tepid $7 million in box office sales and then sank faster than a pay-per-view main event featuring Fit Finlay.Cena plays his WWE role well but he isn't a real actor. Vince is a wrestling promoter who has failed each time he has stepped outside the family business. The Marine was produced 20-plus years too late to have anyone but the biggest WWE Cena fans taking time to see it in theaters.And Vince better keep that cozy economic reality in mind for the next flick.

Im not going to go into every stupid part of this movie but ill just say its EXTREMELY unrealistic. its so bad i think a 5 year old can point out the ridiculous things john cena 'can' do. for example hes able to practically fly and jump onto a moving truck from standing on the ground. he is also able to survive being inside a building that blows up and looks as though the atom bomb was dropped on it yet somehow he still is alive. also i might be crazy but im pretty sure if you were holding onto a truck and being rammed through a building at fast speeds you wouldnt live. also not many people i know can run through walls and not be hurt. speaking of not being hurt there is an instance in the movie while inside a burning building john cena is hit by falling burning wood and is unaffected. this movie is awful and i would recommend if your looking for an action movie to look somewhere else. i cant believe people actually buy this movie and can watch it without wanting to cry.

Attack of the show's Chris Gore put it at best when he said that they tried to hide the bad acting with a bunch of explosion and action. The storyline itself was bad because well it has already been done a million times before. A guy's girlfriend/wife is kidnapped and he tries to get her back.

It's amazing that hundreds of bullets can be fired at point blank range with no one getting hit and people getting hit in the face with fire extinguishers pieces of wood and other objects without so much as a scratch. And then there are people surviving incredible explosions again without getting so much as a hangnail. The directors attempt at moments of humor failed miserably.

This is one movie i wouldn't recommend to anyone except the extreme fans of the WWE or maybe the little kids who believe the storylines in wrestling are actually real drama.one fine point that i thought was extremely humorous about the movie. How is it that you can drive a camero (or whatever the cop car was) at top speeds with a million and one bullet holes in it and not either a) blow up b) blow a tire c) just die or d) not allow the driver to get hit from any of the million and one bullets?i certainly hope this movie was supposed to be strictly a comedy because if it wasn't the director should be shot and left in the car that mysteriously didn't blow up.

I kept waiting for it to get better. I kept waiting for the 'eureka' moment when I finally understood why everyone likes this book so much. It never happened and when I finally came to the end of the book I realized that Mr. Azimov stole a good two hours of my life and gave me NOTHING in return.The story sounds interesting and in the hands of another writer it may have bore fruit. Unfortunately in Mr Asimoz's hands the story falls flat in the implementation. Had the writing not been funny I would have been completely bored. Of course Mr. Azimov did not intentionally make me laugh - sadly his understanding of the human condition appears to be based largely on old cheap pulp fiction novels.

" Being a sci-fi fan myself I decided I wanted to try reading some of the works by the giants of sci-fi. I had always heard how great 'Foundation' was so I thought I'd start with this one. I was thoroughly disappointed! Asimov used way too many large words ('using dollar words where dime words would suffice'). The story seemed to jump around from one time to another. The characters were very one-dimensional and very flat...I didn't have that 'I wonder what's going to happen next to ---'. I just didn't care what was going to happen next to the characters or in the story. There didn't seem to be anything to propel this story along; nothing to develop the characters or the story. I read over 100 pages and I still had no interest in what was happening. (Even Stephen King who can be pretty tough to get into his stories has me hooked within 50 to 60 pages!)

" I just finished reading Foundation and was extremely disappointed. Maybe I was expecting too much something grander along the line of the Dune series. But the book in of itself is an extreme disappointment. I realize Asimov was young (21) when he wrote this but his style leaves a lot to be desired. I'll take an early Arthur C. Clarke book over Asimov any day. This is the first book by Asimov I've read and I'm not sure I want to read another. His style is very dialogue driven with very few if any detail given to what the characters think. Everyone is very two-dimensional. And he never describes any of the scenes were all of this dialog takes place. Part of the interest in science-fiction is exploring new places seeing different things. This entire story could have taken place on an empty stage. In fact it seems like it's written more for a play than a novel. As for the story it starts out interestingly enough. The Empire is going to crumble and to avoid thousands of years of dark-ages a Foundation is set up to preserve the past learning's of the Empire. Well that's what the original thought was at least. Soon we discover there's an alternate motive to this. Once we learn of this motive the story goes straight downhill. Asimov skips decades from one page to another. Characters are introduced that we know practically nothing about and he never tells us anything about them. I've read history books that had more character development than he gives the people in this book. By the time I got to the end I found myself saying 'So what'? Am I supposed to continue on reading this series because it's been called a 'classic'. I've seen the word 'classic' thrown around a little too much sometimes. This is definitely one of those times.

" Recently finding myself with a lot of time on my hands after having just graduated school I started picking up and reading a lot of the 'greatest' works of science fiction. After having noticed all the editorials reviews and awards attributed to the Foundation series I didn't hesitate to order all the books in the series. What a mistake! I'm not sure what people are seeing in these novels but in no way do they even come close to approaching some of the other hallmarks of sci-fi like Dune Ender's Game you name it. This book has a semi-interesting setup about trying to preserve civilization during a coming galactic dark age but beyond that the book devolves into stupid scenario after scenario about how the Foundation is threatened but through the citizens' skill (i.e. sheer stupidity and dumb luck) they manage to somehow make it through the crisis only to face another yawner a few pages later. In between each crisis numerous years elapse so by the time Asimov sets up the next unrelated crises the entire cast of characters changes -- you barely have time to figure out their names much less get to know any person in significant detail.This series of books did nothing but put me to sleep on multiple occassions when normally if a book is good I'll stay up all night to finish it. My advice is to steer well clear from this series and try one of the other highly rated sci-fi books out there -- there are so many others that would be far preferable. ",1.0

I am truly trying to be a bigger person and but I cannot truly support people who do not respect me. I am deleting this book and the 'Rosa Mundi and Other Stories' today.

" I have not read James Marcus' book 'Amazonia' but in a recent NPR interview he insisted that during his Amazon tenure he was never pressured to write positive reviews of things he found crappy. However Amazon's editorial review above makes me doubt such a claim. If the guy had said this movie is so bad that it's good I could accept that. But to suggest that 'Mean Guns' has redeeming qualities that anyone involved with it actually intended it to have? You've got to be kidding.Also do not believe the overall user rating for this movie or the low ratio of helpful to unhelpful votes that my review will inevitably get (assuming anyone ever actually reads it). Most people who have rated it are probably Christopher Lambert fans so they obviously have no taste. For anyone who realizes Lambert has less acting talent than a dead dog let me inform you that 'Mean Guns' is actually terrible. I will admit that I found it to be enjoyably bad -- the incompetence of everyone involved gave me a few pretty good laughs. But enjoyably bad is still bad. I will say this -- at least it was not nearly as horrible as the previous Pyun-Lambert project 'Adrenalin",1.0
" MEAN GUNS is a vile pointless movie with no redeeming qualities. The horrible acting of Ice T has never been so flagrantly evidenced as in this loser. He plays some kind of syndicate lord who assembles all these people who have somehow betrayed the syndicate (this includes for no apparent reason a vampire?). Armed with not only guns but baseball bats the movie is one long let's see how many people we can kill in ninety minutes. The murders are offensively brutal and with a plot that limps along one has to wonder why this movie was even made. How can we root for anyone when they are all heartless cold-blooded killers? Christopher Lambert the stone faced hero of B movies even brings along his little daughter to wait in the car while the murders go on. The movie tries to embrace some kind of code of honor among murderers but is there honor among these low lifes? One female actress who plays Barbie is so obnoxious I couldn't wait for her to meet her demise and it takes a long time to happen too. With an ending that is so forced and implausible MEAN GUNS is one mean film and that doesn't mean you should watch it if you know what I Mean. ",1.0

" As I say don't make the mistake of buying this overpriced dvd. I unfortunately did buy it and what I found was abysmal.Instead of the original Australian actor's voices there are nowpoorly dubbed American voices. I also noticed this version has been cut in certain scenes. I remember one scene in particular near the biginning. The couple who are later attacked by the biker gang are having sex in a field - one of the good guys appears watching them from a distance and shouts over to them. This scene appeared before the first chase scene and is missing from this version.The transfer appears to be a transplant from a poor quality laserdisc version and the sound is in mono.What appalled me was the American dubbing - this seems typically arrogant and ignorant to me. In any other country in the world you would not find this and its unfair and condescending to the portion of Americans who wanted to see the 'unbutchered' Australian version. I have seen this dubbing in the States with English programmes as well (leaving the evil characters with the English accents of course) and its frankly offensive to watch.DON'T BUY THIS DVD - WAIT FOR SOMETHING BETTER TO BE RELEASED!

" When I purchased my HP Z560 Digital Entertainment Center it was going to be where I stored all my music and video so I could access it from any computer in my house on my home network. It was going to be the computer that I used to take care of working with all my digital entertainment. What a let down! This thing does not do much of what it says. First there is a big problem with the video card and the display set up. I swear that the NVIDIA graphics card they put in this unit is incompatible with the rest of the system. I think it would be better off with a different card. They say it will work like a TIVO. It will as long as you don't try to pause the program you are watching and recording. If you do the unit will freeze up and your recording is done. Try to record from a set top or disc and it won't let you.To make a long story short and to quit raising my blood pressure about this unit again. It makes a good desktop computer although fairly slow and antiquated. Try to use it as a media center computer and you will definitely be sorry and disappointed. The personal media device you can get for the computer is kind of nice but not worth buying the computer for. Buy it seperate from HP if you want it. I can not believe that HP put something so junky and glitch ridden on the market. I paid $1600.00 for the unit and it is a POS.

Yeah everyone is playing the notes very nicely but these are merely rote and exceedingly pallid mainly instrumental verions of the originals which on the first album are full of much more passion and spontaneity. There is no imagination or inspiration here no sense of even an attempt to make the music their own. It seems inexplicable that no one involved in this project could hear how dull and lifeless it was. And on a personal level Billy Drewes is a taste I perhaps will never acquire.

" The Jean Claude Van Damme Review Matrix (JCVD-RM)1. Who is he? Andrei a knife throwing KGB agent sent by the Russians to steal the top secret U.S. equipment2. Which family member/friend must be avenged? This early in JCVD's career the mandatory paint-by-numbers plot pieces like this were not in place yet.3. Does he take his shirt off? Half of the movie is on a ship in the water. You think he'd miss the chance for some rays?4. Does he have sex with a C-List actress? JCVD goes for a little anonymous redhead in this one.5. Is there a tournament? Perhaps if a race is sport and all tournaments are sport maybe it's a tournament. Otherwise it's just the Americans versus the Russians6. Is training needed for this tournament? Only acting training7. Does he do the splits in training or in the tournament? This may be the only movie in which a character not only does the splits while wearing a suit and a tie but he also does it in khakis.8. Does he punch someone in the balls? To be honest I can't say I remember it happening. However given the fact that I dozed off during several scenes it's entirely possibly that JCVD performed a fistectomy.9. Does he do a series of flying or 360 kicks? In every single fight.10. Is his enemy unbeatable? Hardly. He's just a little Asian guy with big hair and a black belt.11. Does he overcome an injury or other hindrance? Aside from being a Belgian acting as a Russian and speaking in broken English...not really.12. Does he win? It doesn't matter - the viewer loses.Some planes go down over the Mediterranean and three were carrying top secret laser guidance systems. The rest is a race to get them before the Russians. Somehow a Japanese guy codenamed 'Black Eagle' goes in for the United States and a Belgian guy goes in for the Russians. And that's probably the movie's biggest problem; it's nearly incomprehensible the majority of the time because of various language barriers that aren't overcome.A fan of JCVD action or good movies will be severely disappointed. He's barely in the movie and the rest is just bad. When you begin to crave the acting talents of JCVD then you know the rest of the movie is slop. This is definitely a blemish on his career; I'm just not sure if it's wart or a zit. ",1.0
" Now don't take this into the wrong direction. I like Van Damme as well as Sho Kosugi but even they couldn't save this film from being so boring and so abysmal. I was so bored by this film that not only did I fall asleep during the film I couldn't even finish the thing.An F-11 holding a device that the United States government cannot afford to lose crash lands in the Mediterranean. The KGB lead by Andrei (Played by Van Damme) unfortunately are much closer to finding the device than the CIA. The United States government decides to send in their best man Ken Tani The Black Eagle (Played by Kosugi). Tani decides to head to Malta with his two kids (Played by Kosugi's own children) to find the device before the KGB does.I have nothing else to say about this crap except that even if you're a Van Damme superfan don't bother and just leave it in the $3 bin at BigLots!

As well when you take the mock exams you will soon discover that they have cut corners once again and have recycled questions from the previous sections into the exam. This does not test your knowledge it tests your ability to memorize. When you're done your exam you can look at which questions you got right and wrong but be careful because once you quit the cd all that info is lost and you'll never get to see your precious exam marks again! All in all i was thoroughly dissapointed with my purchase and would have been better off without it. By the way i haven;t even written my board exam so i am not blaming this cd for poor exam results...yet! ",1.0

" Purchased this screen last week and it came with noticeable scrapes across the top. The box it came in was gigantic with plenty of packaging material but the screen was packaged loosely at the bottom. However since it was in another smaller box I'm thinking that the scraping was there to begin with and not from shipping. Still deciding whether to go through the trouble of exchanging it since another reviewer said they had the same damage. I wouldn't want to risk getting another with the same damage and I really need a screen right now. Other than the damage it's a very nice screen. ",2.0
" I agree the CDs are a much needed help since it would be impossible to pronnounce the Yoruba tones without the help of a native speaker. However the design of the book is really poor and confusing. I have found several spealling mistakes in English and Yoruba. And the grammar explanations are very hard to understand.Unfortunately there are not many Teach Yourself Yoruba books that are worth it. This one at least provides basic vocabulary and pronounciation skills. ",2.0
" My children get easily bored with this video. I thought it was several episodes of Thomas but it has A LOT of just children and parents talking about Thomas and all. It doesn't keep the kids attention because what kid wants to sit and listen to a bunch of talking. This was my first Thomas video purchase...hopefully the next will have more shows and less talking! ",2.0
" This is a DVD with footage of a 'Come Out and Meet Thomas' day mixed in between the episodes. Sort fo a promotional piece to be honest. Still decent enough to rent. The DVD extras are limited and not very good. My son seems to like it o kay but it gets pushed aside for more interactive stuff to be found on Sodor Celebration. There is also a ton of toys shown during the 'party/interview' footage which can be a good or bad thing depending on how much you need to control that sort of thing with your child. Also I for one get annoyed at the interviewes not sure why they just annoy me. This production has the feel of an old VHS video copied to DVD without much added to it. I wouldn't throw it out but I wouldn't buy it either. ",2.0
" I bought this thinking it would be packed with Thomas stories. Turns out there are only ten which is a typical Thomas DVD. However between each story it also has interviews with parents and their kids about what they like about Thomas. As I parent I'm not interested in this and I know that my 3 year old would rather watch Thomas than a bunch of strangers any day. Plus the sing-along section has one song. One. We have other Thomas videos that has at least 4 and they aren't special DVD's just normal Thomas collections. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone if you are looking for solely Thomas stories and can find other collections. ",2.0
" Has too many interviews with people at the Live THomas day in Penn. My kids were annoyed and hated this DVD. ",2.0
" All the interspersed kid and parent interviews where they talk about all the trains they have just feels like a thinly disguised effort to sell more product.It's also AWFULLY frustrating that you can't jut buy the DVD Series here as you can in the UK but have to make do with compilations where there are invariably episode duplications.*sigh* ",2.0
" Before I begin let me just say that I absolutely love her Dark series. Those books are great. This one had potential but it just fell flat. Her characters simply weren't developed enough this time for me to relate to them. This effort was decent but not at all up to her usual standards. ",2.0
" This book was a major disappointment. It was missing that special spark that made Ms Feehan's other novels (especially Dark Desire) something special. I found the book had very little action little romance and a 'mystery' plot that was never very mysterious or suspenseful. This is definitely not a book that I will pass on to my friends and family to read. ",2.0
" i was really disappointed with this book. The other ones that she has wrote were very good but this one was dull. it was as if she rushed to put a new book out and didn't take the time to make it interesting. i would still read other books that she writes but i wouldn't read this one again. ",2.0
" I first found Christine Feehan's work through 'Dark Prince'. It was an excellent read and has had me hooked on the whole series! I thought this book would be the same - not even close. The Scarlatti Curse is humdrum. Before I reached halfway I really didn't care about the characters. The secondary characters were underdeveloped and the main characters were two dimensional. I also did not get a feeling for the period or the place. In short it seemed like a short story plot that was enlarged to take advantage of her success with the Carpathian series. Please Christine don't write any more like this. ",2.0
" I have loved all of Christine Feehans 'Dark' novels. I was looking forward to the Scarleti novel as well. I was suprised at her change of writting style. I kept thinking I was reading a Ann Rice wanta be. The characters are now well drawn Nicolette is weak scared and is not consitant with her personality. We do not get to know what makes Giovanni 'tick' he is not well drawn and what motivates him. Feehan spent so much time trying to make the castle a dark scarry place that it was overkill. Nicolette the villiage healer is picked as the bride for the local and powerful Don Giovanniwho is cursed after she heals his neice. He persues her and seems to speak to her with special powers that scare her even though she has her own special healing powers. Nicolette goes from being a superstitious weak scardy cat to not caring at all and doing as she pleases. Giovanni pushes the wedding ahead not wanting to wait to take her. He goes from extremely controlling to being very caring and gentle. Giovanni does not care that he takes her from what she loves or what is important to Nicolette as long as she does what he tells her to do. Nicolette finally figures out that the family 'curse' for the Scarlettis is from a family member and frees Giovanni from the curse. I do not recommend the book it was a disappointment to me. The writter spent to much time using words to describe the landscape and the buildings and the rooms and I don't remember what all else and she did not develope her characters. ",2.0
" First let me say I'd heard that I might find the Dark Series of Christine Feehan's my cup of tea and for some unknown reason thought this was one in the series - no need to tell you I was severely disappointed (and confused).This book really reminded me of the romances my Mother used to read back in the 70's - blech! Lots of dark male broodiness all written from the heroines point of view and of course she's a young innocent virgin._____________edited to add",2.0
" The Premise for this book follows the old gothic format. Heroine goes into spooky house - falls for tortured hero - danger lurks around every corner. I used to love this type of romance but this one was extremely annoying! The plot was good the hero and heroine were a good match but I could not get past all the breaks in the sentences to inclue a couple of Italian words. It seemed that Ms. Feehan tried too hard to add that touch of Italian to every other sentence by putting in the two Italian words for my bother my mother my father my grandfather my grandmother. It was down right annoying to keep reading these few sets of words so frequently. It was very hard to keep the pace of reading the book when the sentences were broken up so often with the Italian. I have been a romance reading for over 20 years and have frequetnly read romance with touches of another language thrown in here and there but this one was just to choppy for me to enjoy. I don't think I'll be inclined to buy another Feehan gothic unless I get the chance to skim it first. I will however keep reading her Dark series which I absolutely love. ",2.0
" It's difficult to understand all the 5-star reviews this album has gotten. The production is excellent and the performances immaculate but the music is cheesy and lacks soul. Honestly the album screams 'sell out' and it was sad to watch the great Wilson sisters come to this. Though it was a commercial success and I'm glad for their good fortune because of it (being from Seattle I have a soft spot for this great band) it is among the least of their albums. Only worth picking up for completists. Everyone else should stick to Heart's very strong earlier catalog. ",2.0
" I've noticed a lot of the reviews of this album note that there are 2 Heart camps. 70's and 80's. To bring this up to date the more recent Heart -Jupiter's Darling Red Velvet Car and FANATIC far faaaaar surpass this dated 80's hair pop. My disappointment came from the fact that listening to the 'Heart' album I could tell that Ann and Nancy were no longer at the wheel. The 80's material was a money making enterprise not Heart making a great album. With the exception of Ann's voice there was simply nothing of 'Heart' left in the music. It was like listening to Toscanini leading a harmonica band. After they got out from under the thumb of Capitol they began to produce 'Heart' music again. Masterful writing Ann's soaring vocals Nancy doing things to an acoustic guitar that shouldn't even be possible. In short order Ann and Nancy are back at the wheel. And it really shows. Next to Heart's new and old material the 80's stuff is cringe-worthy. These ladies are at their best when they are doing what they WANT to do. 'Heart' 'Bad Animals' 'Brigade' and 'Rock the House",2.0
" To me this was the beginning of the end for the Wilson sisters. Sure there are some okay songs on here or so I thought until I recently replaced my vinyl LP with the CD. These songs sound so dated that I can't believe I used to like them. To put it mildly this album was Heart's contribution to the 1980s 'hair band' movement. Synthesizers and drum machines have taken over for Nancy and Howard's guitar playing. Dreamboat Anne and Little Queen still sound as good today as they did when they were released. This CD does not. ",2.0
" This material represents why the 80's died the music is bland and poppy the Wilson sister's garnered their wigs and corsets and the the music became something of an inside joke to those mentioning real bands. Looking back at the cd the music is very dated and is caught in an era best left forgotten. ",2.0
" This pillow is incredibly helpful for people who have difficulty getting comfortable in bed because it affords a variety of positions to relieve painful areas. But getting in bed can require some simple gymnastic maneuvers because the pillow is so thick and cumbersome. And getting out of bed also requires some special moves especially if you have a high mattress. Overall not a simple process for a good nights sleep. The head area also compresses after a few nights of use and rearranging the filling is bothersome. Because it's a considerable investment I end up using it only occasionally. ",2.0

" After all these reviews it is difficult to not feel like I would be doing an injustice ... yet I think that those who claim to like Lhasa would much prefer the originality and talent of Chavela Vargas.

" This (shudder) Madacy released disc is of the 1950 Martin and Lewis vehicle 'At War With the Army.' It was their first film together as stars and was a forgettable mildly enjoyable little comedy. It was adapted (and I use that term loosely) from a stage play which is kind of obvious considering most of the action takes place in two rooms. It does contain an almost memorable Soda machine gag along with a truly curious scene of Jerry Lewis dressed as a lady. The most memorable part is probably the shameful song 'The Navy Gets the Gravy (But the Army Gets the Beans)' sung by Jerry at his most high pitched.The DVD picture is pretty typical of Madacy. It's scratchy with poor contrast and visible compression artifacts. It is however easier to make out than a previous video I had bought from Front Row Entertainment. The discs features include a trivia game a picture of the original poster newsreels (not from 'At War With the Army') and bloopers (from an Abbott and Costello movie not from 'At War With the Army.')

" The slow-paced 'At War with the Army' (1950) was Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis' first starring feature - a bargain-basement military farce that separates the team for much of its footage.

" When we redecorated/upgraded our kitchen 3 years ago I carefully researched new dinnerware for our 'every day' table. I loved the color (plum) of these and bought them. We have no small children or those who mishandle dishes either in serving or washing. Yet these dishes chipped at an alarming rate! I have replaced several pieces but they just continue to chip and they look horrible with a bright white chipped spot in the middle of the beautiful purple bowl or plate. Even those that are not chipped have strange marks and fading on the glaze.I cannot with integrity recommend these pottery pieces as they are low fire almost 'plaster of paris' inside to anyone because if they are like mine have been they will be chipped in very short order -- even with careful handling.Since there was no butter dish to match these plates and bowls I purchased a 'Fiesta ware' purple one and it is still beautiful with no chipping or signs of wear such as the glaze fading. I will be replacing the Waechtersbach with it as I feel that I have given the Waechtersbach more than generous 'try.'I am genuinely surprised that no one else has mentioned this fate to their own plates and dishes.

" I must admit I saw this upon its theatrical release late last year and I was pissed off upon walking out the theater at the fact that I spent 7.50 for something I could've waited for on DVD. The action is great for any fan of many explosions unrealistic fights and over the top car chases(exactly how many times can you shoot a car with automatic weapons and it still drives as if it just came straight off the lot?)...however the acting was poor by practically everyone...nothing convincing at all. I was actually ashamed of screen veteran Robert Patrick's performance....silly punchlines and almost a robotic performance. WWE wrestler John Cena's performance looks as if it was painfully rehearsed one too many times...even the exotic Kelly Carlson's (who had probably every man in the theater wanting her to go to her NipTuck ways of nakedness or sexy lingerie.....sorry fellas no such luck)portayal of Kate Triton(John's fiance) leaves her acting abilities a little less desirable. Even the supporting cast of almost relative unknowns...except for Morgan(Anthony Ray Parker who many may remember played Dozer in the Matrix) however his bad punchlines uneven temper and constant 'black man plight' rants couldnt give CPR to a movie that began drowning from the opening credits. I can't remember the last time I scored something this low but it had to be done for the sake of the action/adventure genre....1 and a half stars. ",2.0
" For Cena's first movie it was okay. Lot's of explosives but I really wouldn't recommend the movie. Some okay jokes and the story line was kind of weak.

" John Cena is perfect as the former marine who goes on a rampage to rescue his wife from killers. The movie moves fast and its slick production and sets adds to the visual eye candy.My only beef is with the WWF empire that produces these Wrestler-turned-Action Star movies. The WWF gave us Stone Cold Steve Austin in THE CONDEMNED which was fun and Austin was great. But like THE MARINE we see almost zero of the world famous torsoes of these super heroes. In THE CONDEMEND Austin never takes off his shirt for one scene. And he has a body to die for. in THE MARINE you've got about l5 seconds where we see Cena without his shirt and his body is amazing. But after that he's fully covered. The reason I worship these wrestling super stars is because they're so damned good looking and they don't mind strutting their stuff in a pair of speedoes. One can only hope that the next WWF action thriller will give us a super star wrestler who exhibits his chest --like Schwartzenneger Stallone Von Damm--and give us fans something to thrill to. ",2.0
" 'The Marine' has an instant appeal. While not innovative it sports some eye-popping pyrotechnics and chase scenes that don't give the audience a chance to catch its breath. John Cena fans will likely be enthralled especially since his character acquires some boxing and martial arts abilities to add to his wrestling repertoire. (Nine lives don't hurt either.) Even the threads and riveting music draw our attention; both a modest update to 'Miami Vice' (the TV series). Seeming random at first John Tritan (Cena) gets established as a sort of Iraq War Rambo whose prowess will undoubtedly help him save his domestic life. Coming home he finds his new job as a security guard dull even if it gets him on the eleven o'clock news and another chance to come home to Kay (Kelly Carlson) his pretty young wife. The plot is simple",2.0
" Oh boy it seems we have a wannabe Rambo in the house! Seriously this is one of those movies that you gotta watch to laugh at. The movie does have a lot of action scenesstuff blowing up people dodging bullets. and none of them are realistic. The good thing this movie boosts is that it doesn't take itself seriously. It has a few of lame one liners it even breaks the third wall in one sceneThe movie tells the story of a recently discharged marine; he arrives home to begin a new life with his wife. They decide to take a road trip have a good time together but his wife gets kidnapped oh noo! Yeah so now Mr. Marine must save her. In the process he beats a lot of bad guys.

" Thank god I borrowed this movie from my roommate. I doubt I would have ever even rented it if I was back in the states (I'm in Iraq right now). This is going to be a short review for a pretty bad movie.Before you read my review please take not that I'm an action movie fan. Whether it's a good one with a pretty decent plot or a fun one where you can drink and laugh to it with its whack out plot and crazy actions scenes. This movie just fell short of anything fun or good.The beginning intro with Cena rescuing some marine buddies was action packed but choreographed horribly. It looked incredibly fake. My hopes for a decent movie faded quickly.One of the cooler parts of the movie was a bank heist that was led by Rome (Robert Patrick better known as T1000 from T2). If it wasn't for the horrible direction and script Patrick would've pulled this character off in a very cool way. This scene gave me hope for an ok movie to maybe get a little drunk to and laugh at the over the top action scenes.Then comes the kidnapping. It felt like 40 minutes of the movie we watched Cena run and jump through the woods trying to rescue his girl from the bad guys. Pretty annoying.Then we see the bad guys take refuge in an abandoned bar in the middle of a swamp that the police were JUST in. Honestly I believe there would've been cops that would've stayed there JUST in case this exact scenario would have happened...but whatever... I dont expect common sense to happen in action movies... especially bad ones like this. So we have Cena taking out bad guy after bad guy here till the oh so predictable twist of the movie happens.If you like explosions trust me about this you'll see massive ones every 25 minutes of the movie it seems like.Also Kate (Kelly Carlson from Nip/Tuck) played a pretty good part for such a bad role. What really makes me irritated about her part though was that she gave the bad guys SUCH hell that there is no way they wouldn't have just killed her to get rid of the crap she was putting them through. Like I said earlier I dont mind cheese in bad action movies but this was just driving me nuts.I gave it 2 stars mainly for Robert Patrick. Like I said earlier he played his part as well as he could for the craptastic script. I would love to see him with a similar role in a movie that's in better hands. ",2.0
" When I went to this movie I was hoping for something decent. But instead I found out that it was the worst action movie that I've ever seen. I'm a fan of the WWE but I know that the wresters can't act to save thier lives. But I went to see this movie because I was hoping that it would make me change my mind. But it didn't there was only one good scene in the movie and that was the very first 5 minutes. John Cena's character in Iraq showed how brave our troops truly are even though he went in guns ablazing. I love action movies I love the testaterone pumping flicks like Terminator 2 Predator and Casino Royale. But this movie didn't get me excited in fact it made me laugh. By the end of the movie my sides hurt from laughing so hard. John Cena is about as good of an actor as he is in the ring. His character survives around 6 or 7 massive explosions without a scratch. I don't mind when an action flick has scenes that can't happen in real life but this was overkill. The only reason I gave this move 2 out of 5 stars instead of 1 was because of it's portrayal of how brave our troops are over in Iraq. When I went to go see it with my friend he and I were probably the only people without Cena shirts on so if you're a fan of Cena then you'll love this movie. I for one can't beleive how crappy of a movie it was. Don't waste your money on this go buy a copy of Terminator 2 you'll thank me. ",2.0
" I did not like it very much...bought it because of the fact that my son went to high school with him and thought it would be nice to have. It was not as much action as I thought it would be....a little dull...but not bad for his first...know he will get better as the 'Rock' did!!! ",2.0
" For the first half hour of this movie the viewer may get the idea that the script Michelle Gallagher and Alan B. McElroy is just awful (with good perception!) but as the film's story evolves the idea that this may just be a National Lampoon parody of action flicks - and if that is the case it is truly a funny bit of entertainment - for a while. Then it becomes obvious that the minimal storyline (ex-Marine's wife is abducted by diamond thieves and Marine elects to leave his one day 'security job' and take the initiative to capture his wife and strike down the bad guys in the swamps of North Carolina) is really just a matrix for staging as many pyrotechniques explosions as possible. It does get tedious.The 'star' of this noisy 'Unrated-for-destructive-violence' film is one John Cena another wrestler from WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) being promoted by the director John Bonito to follow the path of The Rock",2.0

" Patrick was the only real enjoyable part of this whole movie and he kept it entertaining which is the only reason I could think of anyone (who's not a kid or a Cena fan)wanting to see this movie. The movie pretty much portrays Cena in the action film genre as the WWE portrays him as a WWE superstar invincible unbeatable and never get's injured. The way bullets and explosions always seem to miss him make it seem like John Woo films (such as Hard Boiled)are realistic enough to be documentaries. The 2 scenes I can easily point out as examples include when Cena is driving a car at the car the villians are driving and 2 or 3 villians are unloading magazine after magazine rounds at the 'front' of the car shattering the window destroying the hood and yet not one even scratches Cena who doesn't even try to dodge most of them (there's one part where he tries to put up a bullet proof vest but that only lasts for a couple seconds and you mine as well forget it ever happened when compared to the rest of the scene). Then the part at the end fight (with Patrick) where Cena takes a sledgehammer to the gut at a full force impact then continues the fight 15 seconds later like nothing happened.The movie is good as a one time popcorn flick with a few buddies but even then it would still not be enjoyable since like in 9 out of 10 Cena matches in the WWE Cena wins and the opponent(s) people are really cheering for and who are overall better than Cena (in this case Patrick has better charisma and acting skills) lose.See it if you want but I would put it on the 'pass' list. There are worse movies than this. ",2.0
" Lots of action but totally unbelievable just like watching wrestling. Amusing enough to watch but not to own. ",2.0
" If you overlook the fact that they use a Army cover (hat) instead of a Marine one and you over look that the Officer salutes and enlisted man first and not the correct way which is the other way around and if you over look the unbelievable plot and you overlook the poor acting and you over look the over the top explosions and seemingly bullet proof cop car (except when it flying through the air upside down) and you over look the campy dialog and you overlook the super human aspect of a number of the characters like being beat mercilessly with a steel pole and they can still save the day nearly unfettered and if you over look all of that and so much more you'll have an enjoyable film.It is your by the book boy loves girl girl gets in danger boy saves girl they live happily ever after with overly excessive explosions and no surprises no intrigue predictable from the opening scene to the last one type of low grade movie. If none of these little quirks and so many more do not bother you then you might enjoy this. It is at best a `rent it' and not a `buy it' if you must see it you have to see it. But if you opt to skip it you're not missing much in the least. I give it 2 stars and I'm being kind. ",2.0
" You know those movies from back in the day that you thought were great but you watch them now and think they are the worst movies ever made? This movie could certainly fit the later but whether you think it is any good in the first place remains to be seen. The quality of this movie or lack thereof as the case may be is evidenced in the filming sequence (you've seen it a 100 times before in every B movie that has come before it) and the dialog (painful) of the opening scene. There is no plot nor dialog to be had in this movie.This movie is about WWE style action and John Cena. Some good points the death of Angela was a fun scene as well as John's police car going over the cliff. That sequence was excellent but of course the 5 minutes that preceded that of the police car getting shot up was way over the top and beyond belief. I hope they were just making fun of bad action films but I think they were actually just being one. There are a couple of other so unbelievable scenes that I was actually left feeling the director could care less about the intelligence level of his adult audience.So I really can not recommend this movie and thought it bad enough to write a review. If you are a fan of WWE and John Cena and want to see action no more believable as what you might see on Smackdown you may very well like this movie. There is nothing wrong with that if that is your bag and the 16 year old WWE fan I took seemed to like it. But if you expect to get more for your money then I recommend passing on this one.I did want to add a few comments. First I seem to have hit a nerve with some fans. Sorry. That is my honest review. Don't smack-me-down because I really hated this movie that you may have liked. As I said it may very well be likable by some people as it was by the 16 year old I took to see it. Heck I actually enjoyed Paris Hilton's one hit wonder but I'm honest enough to know that many people think even less of her then I did of this movie. All the more power to them as long at they are honest in their review. So give me a break on that please. I did also want to add one thing I liked about this movie which is at least it was cheaper to take my fiance and her son to see it then it was to pay for one pay per view smackdown. ",2.0

" THE MARINE proves yet again that an action movie needs to have the focus on the hero and his motivation. When a film like this one has some truly outstanding fiery explosions to maintain a viewer's interest that attention span will last only for as long as do the FX and even with that there are diminishing returns. John Cena the WWE wrestler is John Triton an ex-Marine discharged from the Corps only because he disobeyed orders to save the lives of three fellow marines. You would think his commanding officer would have understood. He takes a job as a security officer and gets fired immediately again for just doing his job. The primary problem with THE MARINE is the expectation that one has in terms of why one sees this film. I choose to see action movies that have a hard to achieve balance between the exploits of the action star and the believability of the plot. Stallone had no problem doing that in any of his RAMBO films. Cena has a long way to go to find this happy medium.Robert Patrick is the Bad Guy. He mugs makes unwelcome advances to Cena's wife and generally conducts a criminal campaign on the fly. You know that an action film is off kilter when the Bad Guy by default becomes the focus of interest. Cena does little more than take beatings give beatings narrowly escape death in fiery car crashes and scowl on cue. If Cena has a future in acting that future is probably in the ring as a wrestler.

" This movie is almost a joke. The beginning starts off quite nicely with our 'Marine' taking down 9 terrorist with a machine gun and hand-to-hand combat without even being touched. The problem is later in the movie our same 'Marine' is knocked down with a fire extinguisher a branch and a bar. Apparently terrorists trained in the military with machine guns are much less capable than a man with a fire extinguisher.Second the 'Marine' was knocked unconscious by both the fire extinguisher and tree branch yet being punched hard multiple times tied to a chair he is left un-phased.Third our 'Marine' seems to get punched a lot for being such a skilled fighter. Even going up against hill billies he gets thrown through a table. Which also shows hill billies are skilled in hand to hand combat a reality this movie taught me.Fourth no one seems to care that our well respected 'Marine' leaves a wounded cop unattended and steals a cop car. Throughout the movie he causes hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage without being reprimanded.Fifth a good portion of the movie consist of our 'Marine' following people through the woods. That's it.... Wow.... Exciting.....Sixth our marine jumps out of a flaming car over the edge of a cliff. 10 minutes later he is walking on land. Apparently it is left to our imagination how marines can fly.Seventh When our 'Marine' gives CPR its just pathetic. It looks funny to begin with because John Cena's arms are as big as his wifes body but its even worse because he doesn't do CPR right to begin with.I'll be fair there were good fight scenes. There was a girl-girl fight scene (which lasted about 1 minute) though it was much more entertaining than the WWE girl-girl 'matches'. This movie was not action packed it had action but was not action packed. ",2.0
" This movie was not meant to be taken seriously....I think what they tried to do here is re-live the 80's action flick experience. If you watch this movie you are falsly lead to believe that you can be blown up and still survive take a fire extinguisher to the face and get right back up and can be shot at 100's of times and not take a hit. The dialouge is silly however the acting is pretty good. Sit back and enjoy/laugh. ",2.0
" I really hope the American Military didn't support this movie considering how things are going over there in order to recruit more bodies. If so that was a poor attempt. After watching this movie it left me quite speechless. War is entirely different and should not be made glamorous for recruiting purposes.'The Marine' is a very simple film with a few minor twists here and there. In the tradition of The Rock John Cena has begun a movie career after gaining notoriety as a wrestler. Both wrestlers/actors are muscle bound former college football players. Whereas The Rock has now proven he can act in a variety of roles Cena has just proven that he can do action. His role in 'The Marine' is evidence that he may very well be successful in films but he will need to find better material than this. The directing here is nothing special but seeing this is John Bonito's first feature I have nothing to support my cause as I have nothing more to base it on but he is able to deliver a film that is very easy and even if Bonito got a little explosion happy. The plot however is pointless. Throughout this movie these imbecile thieves call attention to themselves every chance they get. After robbing a jewelry store they don't just stroll away as no one outside knows what they did. They blow up a cop car. Why? I have no idea. One member of the group is prone to telling sad stories of his youth. Too often the camera lingers on the bad guys and then quickly gives us a shot of Cena running. Sure Patrick is a bigger movie star than Cena but this is Cena's movie. I really did not care about the bad guys other than how Cena is going to kick their [...].I will say that Cena has the build and look of an action hero in the grain of Jean-Claude Van Damme. He fits right in with the 'unstoppable 80's action hero mold.' He is 90% muscle and 10% charm. He has few lines of dialogue but does well enough with what he has. Robert Patrick hammed it up but seemed to relish playing a wise-cracking psychotic murderer. No one else is worth mentioning as it seems paychecks were just collected. Cena who is also a rapper had also been wearing military attire at his matches. No doubt he is doing so for publicity sake of this movie which celebrates Marines as heroes which is great but nothing he can do is going to generate enough interest to make 'The Marine' a success. ",2.0
" 'The Marine' reminds me of the old-fashioned action films made in the 1980s like Arnold Schwarzenegger's 'Commando.' If you remember this film our hero is a retired elite commando single-handedly saves the kidnapped daughter and kills all the bad guys. The story is incredible I know but fun nonetheless.In 'The Marine' WWE's John Cena plays that hero John Triton a marine discharged for disobeying the direct orders. The difference here is that the hero has to rescue his wife kidnapped by the diamond robbers and the gangs' leader is played by Robert Patrick. And watching 'Commando' is more fun.Frankly I don't care the wooden acting of the cast and the predicable (and unrealistic) story as long as the film provides good actions. Actually I found John Cena is not that bad as critics say and Kelly Carlson as his wife did a fine job. Also 'The Marine' has one car chases with good stunt and one funny one-liner about Robert Patrick's career making role.But things start to look silly when these actions are drawn-out. There are scenes big explosions but they only help lower the film's tension as the poorly-written storyline and choppy editing make it clear that none of these poses a danger to the protagonist who can easily survive and go to the next set-piece. Moreover it's not exciting to see the baddies fighting among them more then once. It's not thrilling to watch them trudging through thick mud of the swamp either.'The Marine' is an old-school action film that needs someone capable of handling the materials (themselves not bad) in a much better form.

" New Orleans is a sultry seductive city whose gardens reflect a rich history. Decadent nineteenth-Century buildings and courtyards provide an exquisite backdrop for exotic profligate vegetation.

Then it offers impassive photos of the Warehouse Arts District and dilapidated fence structures of no particular aesthetic merit interest or relevance.The few published photos available to the buyer are quite nice.

" Asimov had some interesting concepts in this novel. It's unfortunate that he killed them with his stale characters and unbelievable plot devices.

" I read this book based on overall good reviews of the series and Asimov in general. The story had some interesting moments and actually started off quite solidly. But then the politics took over and the Sci-Fi aspect was completely lost. This book felt like a drama class play that could have taken place anywhere and almost at anytime. I never felt like I was in space or that anything related to Sci-Fi was present. I didnt mind the story so much but being a Sci-Fi book means that I expect some technical 'sciency' details and didnt get anything in this book. I also did not like the huge jump from each major chapter regarding time. Just when you feel that the plot and characters are 'settlling-in' you jump 80 years and have to start all over again. Lastly there was very little scene setup. I rarely knew where the dialog was taking place or what the surroundings were...hence the comparison to a stage play.If you like Arthur Clark's style of Sci-Fi like me and prefer the Science aspect of Sci-Fi to be featured in books you read then I would not recommend this book. It is somewhat over-rated and isn't really Sci-Fi In my opinion.... ",2.0
" The first time I tried to read Foundation I was six years old and it was simply too complex for my developing mind. Just a few months ago however I was cleaning out my attic and came across the same old book. To ascertain it's actual nature as interpreted by the adult mind I read it again. I was amazed not only by the sheer brillance and ingenuity of the ideas contained within it not only by the grandiose size of the subject matter but mostly by the writing which I regarded as absolutely horrid. The plot is clunky the conversations roll off the tongue like sandpaper covered in peanut butter and the descriptions could have been written better by some obscure species of mosquito. As a book it could be improved by changing the title from 'Foundation' to 'How Not to Write a Book' or 'Please Steal These Ideas and Rewrite Them in English.' I highly reccomend it to people for use as a very expensive and ineffective paperweight. ",2.0

I love the idea of psychohistory but that's where the love ends for this book. And Hari Seldon dies before we get to know and like him. Dull mostly pointless conversations between people you don't know as the story jumps quickly over time ruin this book. And how lazy of Asimov to not develop his ideas. At one point he gets out of this by having a character watch a movie that we can't see which describes something that would have been interesting and clever had it been developed.I guess I'll finish the series because I've heard the other books are better.

" Right where a character talks about his old age of sixty-two years.Yeah right. An advanced galactic civilization thousands of years old with FTL travel and turnkey exoplanets just right for human habitation everywhere never bothered to find medical treatments for aging. That might have sounded plausible in science fiction 60+ years ago but much less so today. The novel also suffers from a lot of faults which other reviewers have noted. Perhaps Asimov's stories blew geeks' minds in the 1940's and 1950's but his work hasn't aged well.BTW Asimov Heinlein Clarke Carl Sagan and a lot of other scientifically knowledgeable people in the mid 20th Century accepted the existence of exoplanets based on NO evidence at all until the mid 1990's while at the same time criticizing similar claims without evidence as woo-woo. Just by coincidence the exoplanet faith position happened to resemble observable reality somewhat - but it didn't have to. Even then the existence of so many 'hot Jupiters' surprised a lot of astronomers involved in the hunt for exoplanets. Exoplanetologists may not find plausible earthlike planets for many years. ",2.0
" I couldn't wait to read the first of the Foundation novels having got such great reviews and having heard that it's been such an inspiration to so many other sci-fi authors. But I could barely finish it. The book is flat-out boring. There is no action choosing rather to focus mostly on matters of political intrigue. If you like watching CSPAN then you'll love this book.There is also no continuity of storyline or characters. The book constantly jumps ahead in time right about the time you've wrapped your head around the current characters and plot.It's like a set of boring short stories loosely stitched together with an single underlying theme.

" This seems like awfully shoddy science fiction to me. The old complaint about thin characterization isn't even the worst of it nor are the crazy anachronisms [rampant cigar smoking newspapers and casual misogyny]. But so much of this plot develops in the form of uninteresting local political maneuvers between slightly AynRandized heroes and buffooning villians with no sense of place or grandeur whatsoever.The timeline of the novel is suddenly too breif after introducing the vast concept of a 40000 year swing through history and neither the future society Asimov has envisioned nor the apparant brilliance of the plan at the heart of this series are ever portrayed convincingly. Whatever powerful effect this book may have had in its day it is bereft of it now. ",2.0

" The book is written about an empire in the future. I'm not really sure why Asimov thought that the future galaxy would be ruled by an emporer which is a dying system of government instead of a democratic republic. I know this is nit-picking but I didn't like this book.Apparently the future can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy using math and statistics. Anyone who works as a mathematician or statistician as I do knows that it's difficult to predict what's going to happen in anyone's life tomorrow much less the entire world 500 to 1000 years into the future using statistics.This book is intellectual worship which is something I can't stand. Intellectual worship is when people think they are intellecually superior to everyone else so feel they should rule over everyone else if only you would listen to them. This idea drips off the page as event after event is predicted by some really smart dude. This smart dude predicted a collapse of civilization and treated it as inevitable. Another idea that's patently absurd- that any event that occurs is inevitable.If this guy was so smart as to predict with a high degree of accuracy the downfall of civilization and the rising of a new one along with the traumatic events this new civilization would go through why wasn't he smart enough to avert the downfall of the original civilization. Surely with his predictive ability people would listen to him but he decides to let it crumble for whatever reason.And Asimov is a mediocre writer. The story is only moderately interesting because no character really gets developed. I read this book because as a sci-fi fan I felt obligated. ",2.0
" When I was in junior high school Asimov's Foundation Trilogy was my favorite science fiction. Recently I picked it back up and have had to revise my opinion somewhat.First in terms of character and plot development Asimov certainly hadn't hit his stride when he wrote these books. The characters are cardboard cutouts--especially the female characters.More importantly Asimov uses the basic idea behind the series...that Hari Seldon created his 'psychohistory plan' and launched it invisibly determining the future of his Foundations for centuries...as a kind of magic box from which he pulls plot developments. This drains the story of dramatic tension. One knows from the get-go that it'll all work out in the wash. (In the second half of 'Foundation and Empire' and 'Second Foundation' Asimov had found a way out of this problem by introducing a wild card in the deck.)Finally the book hasn't aged well. The technology forseen for his far-future galactic civilization seems positively 'retro'. Normally this wouldn't be a problem...Orwell's 1984 is still an effective piece of fiction even though it's 2002 and the world is far different from the world Orwell envisioned...but the Foundation books' other flaws just seem to make this worse.

" The Foundation novel is very dated which I suppose is a function of the time it was written. Women are almost entirely absent except when they turn to putty over pretty pieces of jewelry. A gun is an 'atomic blaster' and other quaint 50s relics.The one dimensionality of the characters is problematic. I have to admit that although I don't read a lot of science fiction I know priority is never put on characterization. However since nearly all of the ideas of the book are no longer relevant this shortcoming becomes glaring. The book is more of a time capsule than a living book.There is actually a single main character who re-occurs as 3 different personas (Seldon Hardin and Mallow). SeldonHardenMallow is calm calculating and always right. His opponents flail around until the denouement when SeldumHardenMallow has maneuvered them into exactly the right position and emerges victorious. It's so predictable that there isn't any dramatic tension.The biggest problem I had with the book is that the politics seem very nave. This novel was supposedly based on Gibbon's 'The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire' but Foundation seems to have only to most primitive understanding of that work.I don't really understand the love generated toward this book. It seems particularly flat. A lot of people seem to enjoy it -- just not me I guess. ",2.0
" Just writing this to provide moral support for anyone who reads this book and is thoroughly underwhelmed.Asimov's prose is clean but his tone seems uneven in this installment as opposed to the tighter first book.The book is essentially two disconnected adventures... not very appealing.There's a female character in the second adventure that's quite problematic; she's dull and Asimov spends a lot of time and effort on the fact that she's (gasp) not male.Finally this series feels very dated in terms of language attitudes and even vision of the future. 'Nuclear' is the buzzword; everything's like the '50s but nuclear-powered.I liked Foundation but Foundation & Empire tends to wander away from the idea of the Foundation as the main character and instead can't seem to decide whether to focus on galactic-level events or protagonists. This would be excusable if the protagonists were interesting.Go read Jack Vance or Gene Wolfe if you want masterful sci-fi! ",2.0

" The book Foundation by Isaac Asimov has promise but leaves the reader without satisfaction upon completion. Though having what initially appears to be a gripping plot the grip loosens throughout the book. While philosophers may enjoy the lack of action and adventure other readers who crave that amazingly described action sequence will find that this is not the book to get. Taking place beyond the year 12000 A.D the Galactic Empire spanning galaxies is predicted by the revered physcohistorian Hari Seldon to crumble. On a mission to shorten a period of 30000 years of barbarism after the fall of the Galactic Empire to a mere millennium he establishes an association the Foundation to preserve the Universe's knowledge in a giant Encyclopedia. Foundation takes place on many different planets in many galaxies across the universe. This book spans many generations and involves many characters as the book covers in different plot lines that converge at the end.Foundation is a book that focuses on political issues thus making the book void of action and adventure. This can make the book extremely boring and aggravating to some readers. The story focuses on conflicts among activist parties and groups conspiring against the political leaders of the Foundation's home world Terminus as well as diplomatic and religious conflicts between the Foundation's home planet Terminus and neighboring kingdoms such as Anacreon and Smyrno along with greedy kingdoms bent on conquest of their neighbors. But out of the 285 pages of the book there is only one significant action sequence which is between the kingdom of Anacreon and the Foundation. The sequence involves a mass riot and uprising of priests on Anacreon's home world along with the total emancipation of the Anacreonian naval fleet by a priest who threatens to curse the fleet. When characters like the mayor of Terminus and his advisors discuss war or the inevitability of a war there never is an explanation of what occurs during the fighting just a summary of the war and who is the victor. An example is at the end of the book when there is a war between the Foundation and the world of Korell because of disagreements over religious beliefs and the tolerance of missionaries. The war is only summed up in an excerpt from the 'Encyclopedia Galactica'. Another noticeable point about Foundation is how confusing it is in many aspects. The book is broken up into 'Parts' that separate time setting and characters. A part entitled 'The Mayors' which takes place mainly on Terminus and involves the mayor Salvor Hardin and the relations between his world and the kingdom of Anacreon is then followed by one entitled 'The Traders' which takes place many decades later and involves totally different characters in a different part of the galaxy. When and where each part takes place is not answered until later into the chapters of the part. Also confusing is the fact that new characters are introduced quickly in every part thus making it harder for the reader to grasp. If the reader gets attached to a character or really likes where the plot and characters are going in a certain part he or she will be unpleasantly surprised when those characters are never talked about again in the novel after that part.One good thing about Foundation is that it expresses new and intriguing ideas about predicting the future through the science of psychohistory and what the human race and universe will be like in ten more millennia. This includes the idea of having a Galactic Empire that controls millions of planets. Along with ideas of nuclear power still being the most advanced power system man-sized force fields able to block any nuclear handgun's blast and giant space ships with the capability to destroy planets are discussed. Also the ideas of monarchy being the prime governmental system is included in the novel. These may seem like interesting ideas that would make Foundation a great book but the reader may find that these ideas also make the story harder to understand because they are either seemingly too primitive for the time period or too far-fetched to be logical. This book could be someone's favorite book if they happen to like philosophical books without action. It could also be the bore of a lifetime for some people. ",2.0
" With all the rave reviews about this book perhaps I set my hopes too high. I just really didn't care for this book. There is almost no character development (since every chapter spans huge jumps in time) and the 'science' in this novel takes a back seat to the political ideas of the author. With endless pages of dialog and few reasons to care about any of the characters I had a very hard time getting through this one. And while I know it was written years ago the author's science-fantasy was pretty much limited to 'nuclear powered devices.' That just didn't feel like much of a stretch of the imagination all things considered.I thoroughly enjoy sci-fi when told by authors such as H.G. Wells and Ray Bradbury. These authors know how to paint a picture in your mind and bathe your imagination in colorful imagery. In Foundation however I was thoroughly unimpressed by the style context and story as told by Azimov - it was boring unimaginative and I never even had the pleasure of painting the scene being played out in my mind. I would definitely not recommend this book. ",2.0

" Asimov is often said to have a flat style and to be unable to create credible characters. It's my opinion. And Asimov is never more ridiculous than when he writes about feelings especially about love (scenes seem to be described by a child or a thinking machine). But this writer is still gifted at setting clever plots every reader will enjoy for instance in his robots tales (of course do not expect more than a quality entertainment as often with sci-fi). However Fondation is not really a clever book ; it is not boring but it has poor content. You will finish it but probably won't read it again. First problem it is impossible to believe in psychohistory which smells like positivist propaganda from the 19th century. And because he has nothing more than an adventure story to tell Asimov uses all kinds of tricks to grip the reader including lots of surprises justified by unlikely and twisted arguments some of which you may find hard to swallow. To conclude Fondation is a kind of cartoon ",2.0

Being an avid fan of Asimov and the Foundation seriesthe younger version of the mathimatical genius did not match with older one who changed the history of his race for the better; nor did I think that the story with female very appealing again it did not match. The story seemed tacked on to the series just to write another novel. It is unfortunate that the writer who invented the positronic brainthe three law of robotics and of course the genuis of the foundation series wrote such a tacked on story. ",2.0

" You really must hand it to Christopher Lambert. After showing great promise in the action film 'Highlander' back in the 1980s his career rapidly took a nosedive. Lambert could have been the next big action star if he had played his cards right but instead he followed up his initial success with the lengthy and oftentimes plodding 'The Sicilian.' Actors who make this type of mistake rarely call it quits; they merely head into the realm of B movies where all things are possible if one is willing to throw such antiquated notions like dignity and art to the wind. The 1997 film 'Mean Guns' shows Christopher Lambert at the heights of his nadir. To be honest Christopher shouldn't carry all of the blame for this lifeless excursion on Mount Boredom",2.0

So because of this I bought Mad Max 1 (The U.S Version DVD) through Amazon which has the American voices dubbed over the original sound track (which I didn't know at the time). Me being Australian and having watched the original I found the U.S version very disappointing.

" For the cost this puzzle is not well made. The pieces were locked together so firmly that the puzzle was very difficult to get apart. The edges had visible splinters and over the course of a few days the tray warped to the point that it doesn't sit flat on a table. The edges of the image on the pieces began to fray immediately as the puzzle was taken apart. To make the puzzle usable I had to spend 15 minutes sanding the interlocking edges placing a slight bevel on the bottom of each piece. I then rubbed a white crayon on each edge surface. This made the puzzle easy to work for my 2 year old grand daughter. On the plus side the image is bright and colorful and the puzzle is simple enough for a toddler to work.

If you haven't bought or listened to any of this album yet listen to the Amazon cuts of 'The Music That Makes Me Dance' and 'People' alone to see what I mean.Let's face it -- if this album came out today on its own merits with Ms. Streisand as a newcomer or even an 'American Idol' contestant you would stay away in droves. No amount of blond hair dye can turn back the vocal clock.So in the spirit of the kind of blunt honesty I hope Ms. Streisand would appreciate let's call this is an admirable effort from a legend who deserves an atta-girl for still getting up to sing in front of a VERY well paying crowd.

" I had the opportunity to see Barbra Streisand in concert in Boston and it was one of the best times I have had in recent memory. She still looked beautiful sang some of the songs very well and even interacted with the audience in a way she never seemed to in her previous live recordings. That being said I do think this live CD is probably not her best.As many have said her voice has obviously lost some of its power and you can truly hear her struggling to sing some songs that in the past she sang almost effortlessly. She also sounds like she is about to lose her voice and/or breath altogether at times. And while she sings many of the must sings not only must it be said that the original recordings sound better but have even been performed better on discs such as One Voice or The Concert.In both acts she comes out singing almost as good as ever with her voice astounding you with the fact she hits all the notes and can still hold them for a long time. However as the acts go on the voice slowly starts to deteriorate with her struggling through some of the more challenging songs.That being said I do realize she is getting older and the voice always goes as a singer matures. But here it just sounds like Barbra hasn't been taking care of it very well especially since many about her age like Aretha Franklin and Liza Minnelli still have a lot of voice left (especially if you consider all the stuff they have done to themselves over the years). If two performers who have famously neglected caring for their voices over the years can still pull off a good performance why can't she? People have even said she doesn't even do a warm up before she performs.While she does quite a few good performances (especially in the beginning) you could tell Il Divo was there to hide her struggling. Also the sequence seems a little uneven with all the hits and Funny Girl at the beginning and mostly obscure songs in the second act. If she mixed it up a little more and tried to make more surprising choices (like with 'Ma Premiere Chaison') this would have been a true must have.As it is this is a for-the-fans purchase. If you are looking to start collecting her albums this is not the place to start. If you are interested in how she sounds live her 1994 Concert recording is a better place to start. Anyone who listens to this will feel like they missed something by not being there and they will be right. ",2.0

" In BLACK EAGLE Jean Claude Van Damme had barely begun making a name for himself. He was less well-known than Sho Kosugi with whom he had to share top billing. The plot is a nonsense actioner between Kosugi as a CIA op and JCVD as his KGB counterpart. What is of interest is Van Damme's interpreation of a Red bad guy. This was not his first appearance as a Russian fighter. In NO RETREAT NO SURRENDER he was Ivan a Russian mafia enforcer. Here he is Andrei a KGB operative who is battling Kosugi for a secret weapon. When Van Damme plays the heavy he is somehow more threatening more lethal than when he is the punching bag good guy. One of his best moments in this or any of his other actioners occurs when he is not fighting at all. He is seen as merely talking to his wife who is genuinely concerned for his safety. Their verbal interaction marks him as distinctly human as they ponder his looming fate. Further his aggressive fight scenes with Kosugi are first rate. Van Damme's untimely demise with a ship's propeller raises some unexpected sighs of sympathy. BLACK EAGLE is a watchable early slice of a very young JCVD as he proves that given the right script he can deliver acting on cue with the same verve as one of his patented roundhouse kicks. ",2.0

" Recently my wife and I wanted to see a decent drama. (TV really has become the 'wasteland' predicted in the 1950's; moreover we didn't know that the 2005 version of Charles Dickens' 'Bleak House' would be re-run on PBS within the next few weeks. We'd missed it last year.) So we checked our old VHS collection and found we'd taped the 13-part series 'To Serve Them All My Days' from Masterpiece Theatre in the mid-1980's. Our copies even included insightful commentary from Alistair Cooke. Remember him?At the end of 'To Serve Them All My Days' Mr. Cooke said an upcoming program would be 'The Good Soldier ' a 1981 BBC production. We didn't remember this one and thought it might be worth viewing if it was anywhere near the quality of 'To Serve Them All My Days.' Stars of 'The Good Soldier' were said to include Jeremy Brett of Sherlock Holmes fame and Elizabeth Garvie who played Elizabeth Bennett in a quite entertaining version of 'Pride and Prejudice' in 1979. Robin Ellis whom we also liked in 'Poldark' would play John Dowell the vacuous American husband and narrator of 'The Good Soldier.'I searched the Amazon.com listings to see if 'The Good Soldier' might be available on DVD. Amazingly it was due to come out the following week. The reason I go into all this is to say we had every reason to believe that this production would be a good one coming as it did from what we regard as the 'golden age' of Masterpiece Theatre. What we got instead was disappointing.In all honesty we did find most of the acting scenery costumes and other production features of 'The Good Soldier' to be fine. It was the story that let us down--if there really is a story. From what we can tell the saga takes place in the 9-year period before World War I 1904-1913. It's possible the author Ford Madox Ford (who had changed his last name from the very German Hueffer) wanted to return to a more pleasant era when he finished this piece in 1915. This was shortly after World War I broke out. If the author also wanted to show how decadent and purposeless things were at that time he may have succeeded there too.As I was saying the story takes place about 100 years ago and centers on two middle-aged couples. One is English (Edward and Leonora Ashburnham); the other American (John and Florence Dowell). They meet at a German spa and get along so well they keep meeting there over nine ensuing summers. On the surface they seem well-behaved well-dressed and friendly. But beneath the calm and elegant facade Edward is a latter-day Casanova whom women find irresistible. He seduces one woman after another right under his wife's nose finally to include Florence the wife of his friend John Dowell. (Florence has been faking a heart condition in order to reduce John to the role of solicitous keeper). But when she sees Edward alone with his teenage niece Nancy Florence gets jealous and kills herself. When Edward can't have Nancy he also kills himself. Nancy who came from a broken home and was raised by nuns then goes insane. Despite all this John Dowell ends up with Nancy and becomes her keeper just as he'd been for Florence.Some of the dialogue seems tongue-in-cheek if not downright campy. One example is where Leonora accuses Florence of being a whore. Florence objects but Leonora dead-pans 'All whores say that.' (Ironic since Leonora is supposed to be a devout Irish Catholic and sensitive about her faith and heritage. Also she's quite privileged and refined. What would she know about whores?) Similarly John Dowell seems to be especially gullible and naive all the way through the story even as he narrates. In fact he starts his narration with the quote 'This is the saddest story I've ever heard.' John also says shortly after his wife's suicide 'Now I can marry Nancy.' Maybe it's supposed to be funny? Maybe not? We're told in the analysis that the author wanted John to be 'an unreliable narrator.' Oh well at least we're spared the Louis Carroll line",2.0

I have to hold the pot directly under a light to see the markings at all. Also I often find that my rice is not cooked through when the cooker indicates it is finished. The final straw for me is that it is pretty cumbersome to clean. If it made perfect rice the cleanup wouldn't be an issue but I'm not sure that the rice in this cooker has ever turned out as good as the cheap one I used to have that I picked up at Target. I am now going back to a cheaper model - don't want to spend a bunch of money to end up with a dud again. ",2.0
" Probably more useful as a soup cooker or steamer. The rice always seems to come out browned and hard on the bottom even if you double the recommended amount of water. ",2.0
" Cooked rice fine for the first month then suddenly burned out for no apparent reason. I didn't even have a chance to try out the porridge/soup cooker and steamer functions. Now I will have to ship it back to Sanyo for a replacement unit. ",2.0
" I was so excited to finally be getting a rice cooker stateside! But I hate this one. Here are the reasons",2.0
" I am very happy that I purchased this rice cooker.It is easy to use brainless- just add waterrice and forget about. It is extremely convenient and makes excellent rice. Guests have asked how we cooked the rice because it was perfect. ",2.0
" I received this rice cooker from Amazon.com in early July 2010 and it performed beautifully for about seven months. It's sturdy and very easy to clean. We made rice about twice a week with no problems. Then the 'WARM' light stopped working and it shut off automatically. Next the 'WARM' light started working again but the rice was hard even though all the water had been absorbed. We used the same type of rice (long grain brown) and the same proportion of one cup rice to two cups water that we always used. The time it took the cooker to finish also didn't change.We paid $48 plus shipping. That makes each batch of rice cost approximately $l to cook based on the cost and estimated 56 batches (two batches a week for seven months). The short life of this product is commented upon in other reviews; however I found the same complaints about other brands of rice cookers.I just orderedPanasonic SRG06FG 3.3-Cup Automatic Rice Cookerfrom Amazon. It's smaller feels cheap has no 'WARM' function and is much harder to clean; but the first batch of rice was perfect. The Panasonic also carries buyer reviews complaining about the short life but I couldn't find any rice cookers that didn't. At least it only cost $25.60I have friends with rice cookers that they have used successfully for years and this experience seems to be repeated in Amazon reviews",2.0
" I was pretty disappointed with this CD and don't think I'll be buying another Musiq CD because he seems to be going downhill. He's basically regurgitating the first two projects with not very much success. I really like Musiq's whole vibe hopefully it's not too late for the brother to pick it back up again. ",2.0
" I too bought this disc because Ray McVeigh is the guitarist. His playing on the Professionals 'I Didn't See It Coming' record is incredible. The guitar tandem of Ray and Steve Jones (sex pistOls) on that record was as far as I'm concerned the punk equivalent of Keith Richards and Ron Wood. Tasteful catchy weaving guitar lines that are stuck in my head forever.There is none of that here. Like many industrial records everything is so sludged in effects you can't make out any style at all. There are also appearances by a few other artists I dig but the same problem exists there.If you need another industrial record this is better than Filter or any of that nonsense but it's nothing that's going to change your life.

" A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court did a very good job informing the reader about the Biblical justification of some very important Catholic Traditions. However while reading this book aside from the informative parts I felt as though I were reading a fairytale. To start the whole concept that after the death of his father Michael's mother would just pull all the children out of school to go to Kentucky seems unrealistic especially because it is near the end of the school year. Once in Kentucky everything seemed to work out just about perfect for Michael. When there he managed to learn a plethora of information about the Bible and his faith in a very short amount of time and always he knew it just when he needed it. Also at the Bible Discussions despite never having any of the books there that helped him originally he remembered perfectly every argument the books brought up and every book chapter line and verse from the Bible he sited in order to back his arguments. The response of the Fundamentalists to his proof also was somewhat too perfect for Michael. The Fundamentalists such as Luther Jimmy and Les appeared to have more of an amazed response to Michael's arguments rather then to have any really strong dissentions. Had he encountered a few more problems and a few more issues or strong objections by the Fundamentalists it would have been more genuine. Michael just always had the answers right when he needed them and they were perfect leaving almost no ground on which the Fundamentalists could stand. I think that they [the Fundamentalists] would have been much more outraged and not quite so passive of his contentions especially Les. Overall I did feel the book provided some good information about Catholic Faith and Tradition however the actual story seemed too cliche and perfect to grab the interest of this reader. ",2.0
" A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a Catholic vs. Fundamentalist Christians story. Michael the main character who went from Philadelphia to Kentucky defended Catholic views and procedures. He tried to explain new ideas to the Fundamentalist but they where not open to these ideas. I personally felt it became better towards the end of the novel. At first it was slow-moving and hard to keep track of all the characters. The description became hackneyed along with the plot. Also reading about the farm life was hard to relate to. After the heated bible discussions began the story was easier to read. Overall this book was better than I had expected. ",2.0
" The other reviewers do a good job of summarizing the plot of this novel so I will not go into those details. My one compliment to this book is that the truths of the Catholic faith are presented honestly as the young man struggles to defend his beliefs against many common misconceptions and accusations.As a story itself however the novel is trite and irritating. I really wanted to connect to this young man who lost his father but the characters of the young man his dead father his mother and siblings were too idyllically drawn to be real. While I know many good Catholics and happy families I could not relate to the O'Sheas of this book as they seemed so cloyingly perfect. I couldn't finish this book and I wouldn't even consider handing it to one of my teenagers. Perhaps those who live in a Catholic 'bubble' might find this novel interesting. I for one would rather study the catechism with my children to deepen our faith and then when reading time comes encourage my children to crack open novels with well-developed complex and compelling characters settings and plots. This novel is not one of those. ",2.0
" Although the doll is great (like all Barbie - Kellie dolls) the jumpin castle was pretty much a waste of money. We really didn't get it to work right and in the long run my daughter just played with the doll. Unless you are buying it for the doll I wouldn't recommend this one just a waste of plastic here.

" Well I don't understand what everyone saw in this that I missed but clearly I missed it. This is definitely NOT a workout for beginners.

May I suggest Rodney Yee's 'Yoga For Athletes'? Not specifically for surfers as this one claims to be but superior in production and he leads you through the routine...and you may actually use it.

" Beware of translated works that don't mention the name of the translator.That should have been my first clue. I'm not sure who did the translating of this collection but he obviously does not have a thorough knowledge/appreciation of Russian humour and literature. I can say this because I'm from Russia and after reading the original version of Diary of a Madman (I didn't bother further with the others) and comparing it to this one I was disappointed by how lengthy and confusing the passages were. The language was tripping over itself rather than flowing with the Gogolian humour and absurdity. It was boring and difficult to follow and had none of the finesse that for instance Pevear and Volokhonsky's version was able to capture. Most surprising is that entire sentences were missing from certain passages. It seems that whenever there was a phrase the translator couldn't make sense of or see how it fit into the scheme of things he just omitted it entirely!!! This is really offensive to the writer and unfair to the readers.For goodness sake he didn't even get the name of the dog right!! It's 'Medji' not 'Meggy'---just because this sound doesn't exist quite the same in the English language doesn't mean you can rename the dog! (Unless it isn't read 'Meggy' like 'Peggy' but most English readers will read it this way anyway)But the dog isn't the most important part. It's really the fact that the translator did not do Gogol justice. He did not treat this work with the dignity and reverence it deserves and as a result has put out a shoddy interpretation of a classic tale.I gave two stars because I did notice some attempts to capture the complexity of dry wit as is often the style of satirical Russian authors. It is indeed very difficult to do this with English. Whoever this translator was they made a solid effort; unfortunately he just couldn't carry it. And the publisher should be more selective with the quality of work it puts its stamp on. ",2.0
" The previous reviews must have come from students of theauthor's or students of students of the author's. Perhaps friends ofthe author? I can't imagine anyone thinking this book is good. A good comedy maybe.The techniques in this Ju-Jitsu book are almost offensive in terms of practicality. And though he does outline some tactics and concepts for applying the techniques of this art this is most likely a book for his students to read so they can brush up for their tests but not for serious self-defense.In fact this is not a book for any one interested in learning self-defense. Buy the book if you want to get killed on the street. Otherwise avoid it unless you're a student of the author of course. I'd hate to see what the 'Basic' book is like and as funny as this particular book is it's not worth the money to buy it even for a good laugh. ",2.0

" This movie just didn't grab me at any point. I am usually a tremendous fan of McKellan's work and like Fraser's style. However neither really clinched it in this film. The scene stealer in this blase film has to be Redgrave playing McKellan's Hungarian housekeeper. The film covers the recollections of the director of the original Frankenstein film. McKellen finds a confidante in Fraser the yard/pool boy. While the recollections could have been riveting somehow the delivery is flat and you find yourself saying 'who cares?' most of the time without forming any affinity for either character's plight. Yes McKellen is an openly gay actor and yes Fraser does a bit of a nude scene but that's no reason to run out and buy this film. Rent it on a slow Saturday afternoon. It's watchable but you won't want to re-watch it. ",2.0
" Okay I'll admit it was sort of scary but it got on my nerves how completely unlikeable the characters were. When one of the humans fell prey I thought 'so what'...when one of the vampires was being high and mighty I thought 'whatever'. Having the vampires turn into a grotesque ugly beast is orginal but actually rather distasteful. It did have a lot of surprise twists to the plot which saved it from being awful but I won't read it again and I won't keep the book. My biggest complaint is that no one could resist the draw of vampirism...what absolutely no one? Come on. ",2.0
" This book seemed like just another rehash of the basic training storyline from Starship Troopers. But there's less to it than in Starship Troopers. I don't like the characters. The only one that says anything other than the 'gee shucks we're in the space patrol' line is an utter creep and many of the scenes just drag along. I heard that kids have liked this book and it seems more written for teenagers than adults but there's not a lot to recommend. Only in the last 30 pages does the book pick up and start doing things but up until then it's training training and more training.For better Heinlein books of this style try either Starship Troopers or Podkyne of Mars.

" With his days of theatrical releases behind him Chuck Norris' career revolved almost exclusively aroundWalker Texas Ranger. His extracurricular output (i.e. DTV movies) seemed to consist mainly of favors to his sons and brother but at least those were still technically Chuck Norris vehicles unlike this one. 'Logan's War' is a film with an identity crisis wanting to be an action/revenge/mafia thriller on one hand and a quasi-inspirational drama on the other...but without Chuck Norris in the lead. I'm not a diehard fan of the man but even I can tell that this would've been a better movie if the man featured most prominent only the DVD cover was also the man most featured in the movie.The story",2.0
" The first of the two Cristina re-released CD albums is a whole load of fun but fans of that one need to be aware that there's no trace of disco on 'Sleep It Off' and it comes over as a bit more serious. Cristina is undoubtedly a talented and well-read wordsmith but here she takes on a more new-wave/punk-tinged musical approach which still shows off her superbly acidic lyrics but without the disco backing music it lacks the charm that made 'Doll in the Box' such a fun album.I must be in the minority here as more educated music lovers than myself are currently raving over this album but I found this one a little too arty-farty. Cristina has said herself in interviews that she considers this her true first album and dismisses 'Doll in the Box' as just a bit of cheeky fun saying it did not represent her real self. The songs on here suggest that Cristina is an angry young woman with a lot of axes to grind. She expresses her bile very succinctly but the biggest drawback to this newfound sincerity is the revelation that Cristina can't really sing that well a fact that was masked by the camp vocal delivery she applied on the previous release. It makes the songs much less pleasant to listen to which marks it as a less successful album in my book.The bottom line is that Cristina's two albums belong in entirely different genres. The first is a highly original combination of disco froth with biting sarcasm whereas the second one is heavy on the sarcasm but with none of the froth. And that's not so original it's a style that you can get from dozens of other music releases...groups like The Waitresses were doing exactly the same sort of thing around the same time. I don't think I'll get any helpful ticks for this review but buyers take note",2.0

" Listening to this synthesized 21st Century adaptation of a great classic could turn a classical enthusiast into a classical hater. After listening to this anemic attempt at capturing the power of a acclaimed musical portrait by using synthesized instruments one is left to wonder why a recording company hasn't recorded this piece using a large orchestra. It just begs for the real thing. At least with a large orchestra there might be more justification to charge $23 for just 33 minutes of music. I would strongly urge classical music lovers to approach with caution if they are thinking of buying any of the other selections in this classical music series played by Alexander Jero. Too bad Amazon doesn't offer a money-back guarantee on opened CDs. As for the sound it is enveloping if you like to be surrounded by harsh virtual instrumentation. ",2.0

" The original Outrun is a timeless classic. It's one of those video-games that will last forever and it came out of the golden era of wonderful arcade innovations along with Double Dragon and Splatterhouse. Outrun was the first great racer better than Pole Position on the Atari!!!There have been plenty of sequels and spin-offs to Outrun from the kinda okay Turbo Outrun to the just plain stupid Battle Outrun. None really had that extra spark which made the original so amazing. Outrun 2006 may not end up a classic but is still a brilliant game in it's own right.Rekindling that hedonistic free-spirited just-get-in-and-drive-anywhere feeling and sacrificing all the modern racing features for just sheer joyriding pleasure Outrun 2006 is just such an easily accessible game for anyone.As usual it's filled with gorgeous scenery brilliantly blue skies and amazing music. The classic 'Magical Sound Shower' (a great great tune indeed) has been remixed but it also contains the 1986 mix for the purists.The only negative thing I can say about this game is that once you've finished it 5 times (such as I have already) there's not much point in going back to the same old courses. They could have included more.Ah well it's still a game you should invest time and money in.Graphics ASound AGameplay ALasting Appeal C+ ",3.0

I think it may have mads an interesting documentary for older kids who had liked Thomas as small children but for little kids it does not hold their interest long enough to get to the next story.

These are not just Thomas stories but a mixture of episodes supposedly picked by children who went to the A Day With Thomas event in Penn. at some point. Preceding each story is a 40-second or so clip from the event with parents and children commenting on the TV series. You cannot skip these with the skip button; you can fast-forward but that's a hassle isn't it? This is why some customers are understandably upset.But my two-year-old actually likes the footage from the event -- set to his favorite T&F; songs -- more than the stories themselves. Most of his favorite episodes are not here so he ends up only watching the event footage and clapping every time he sees the mock-up Thomas train with all the happy children onboard.If you own few other Thomas videos I think this is a decent value with ten episodes that more or less represent the T&F; series. That is pretty much every episode finds the engines 'cross' -- I'm starting to get real sick of that word! ",3.0

" As an avid reader of Christine Feehan I was pretty excited when 'Scarletti Curse' was published. Unfortunately the novel did not live up to expectations. Unlike Feehan's earlier novels these characters were not well-developed and the plot was relatively shallow. There were flashes of Feehan's characteristic imagination but over all it was a disappointing read. ",3.0
" For many years the Scarletti family history has been shrouded in curses and dark mysteries. Whispers of evil murder and insanity have been going around the villagers about the family that rules their lands. They say that no bride has ever survived in the palazzo and considering the number of women who have met their untimely death in what everyone has come to refer to as the Palazzo Della Morte (Palace of Death) it seemed that the curse is true.Unbeknown to the villagers the current don has set his eyes on their healer Nicoletta the woman whose identity they have protected for fear that she will be branded a witch by those who might misinterpret her gift of healing. So how did Don Giovanni Scarletti find out about their beloved Nicoletta when no one has spoken of her to outsiders? Could the rumor be true then that he has powers because he is in league with the devil?THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a dark and mysterious novel filled with suspense and sensuality. Nicoletta is a very likable heroine with her wit and exuberance. I loved the way she seemed to embrace life with such open arms. Her compassionate nature and youthful innocence is quite endearing. Giovanni's character is such a mystery. The way he treats Nicoletta with such tenderness is such a contrast from how people perceived him to be.I must say though that even though the author has done well in describing the atmosphere within the palazzo including the design and architecture lending to the eeriness of the story there were some parts that dragged a bit. I also didn't care much about the political intrigue and thought that it wasn't blended in well with the story. I might have understood it more had the author bothered to actually tell us which date the story was meant to have happened (I'm only guessing 15th or 16th century). I know this seems trivial but when I'm reading a historical novel I do like to know what period it's supposed to be.Overall this wasn't a bad book. I did enjoy the banter between the don and his barefoot bride. You can read about Giovanni and Nicoletta's descendant Antonietta Scarletti in Dark Symphony (which I'm reading at the moment). ",3.0
" This was a great book! But the dialogue between Nicoletta and her guardian just seem to drag on forever! I missed the intense dialogue that Feehan usually devotes to the two leads. It seemed that they had very little interaction except for the last 1/4 of the book. Why such devotion to this mother-daughter relationship when it didn't seem to lead to anything crucial within the story? It really detracted from the couple's story. Other than that the two leads were great and I agree with previous entrys - PLEASE write a book on the other brothers. ",3.0
" At first it was interesting because the character Nicoletta was a free spirit who vowed never to be married to anyone who would subject her to abuse or become servile to. It was when she met Don Giovanni Scarletti she sensed something evil about him and his family. Don Scarletti had possession of her mind body and soul. His dark features were erotic yet frightening to Nicoletta. However I have found myself getting a little bored with the book. It seems as if something that is bound to happen doesn't happen. It's a good read but unfortunately I am getting restless and impatient with the Scarletti curse and the passionate fires between Nicoletta and Don Giovanni. ",3.0

" I enjoy Ms Feehan's general writing style and loved every one of the Dark Series books...but this gothic started very slow. For over a hundred pages I still felt like the background was still being set and the real story hadn't begun. Finally she gets to the gothic mansion and I felt that THAT is when the story began. Once at this point the plot seems to take up some speed and has a lot of suspense and gothic darkness. Although some questions are answered I felt like she could have taken some of the characters a bit further. I also felt like some of the scenes were startlingly switched for the suspense and I had to go back and re-read a page again to figure out what was going on. I wouldn't re-read this again but would still probably want to try her next gothic to see how that one goes. ",3.0

There were also a lot of minor characters with many names that the reader has to keep straight.Also while Nicoletta's supernatural powers were explained pretty well one never really gets to understand why Giovanni has them or where they come from.But all of that being said it was creepy and certainly kept me reading. I was still thinking about the book this morning as I woke up so that's something. While I wouldn't recommend this book as being one of her best it is certainly an entertaining read. ",3.0

" This release made a big impact for the Wilson Sisters and company. The four singles are all quite good and even some of the album tracks Nobody Home in particular are fairly ear catching. Will Heart be as memorable as the Beatles Stones Eagles or Fleetwood Mac I doubt it. However they did make some noteworthy contributions to the world of rock n roll and a good portion of that is on this album. ",3.0
" While I still enjoy listening to this song 20 years after its release it is not my favourite Heart album. I believe their best work lies in the music they released in the 70's from the Dreamboat Annie Little Queen Dog and Butterfly Bebe Le Strange and Greatest Hits/Live albums.Heart can rock - they still rock to this day and the 1985 Heart album was a commercial success complete with the big hair glam make-up and power ballads but in my opinion that wasn't Heart. That was a marketing recipe for success for Capitol records. The music although entertaining radio-friendly and sometimes charged (What About Love Never If Looks Could Kill Shell Shock) is not organic or idealistic. Lyrically the songs are weak and trite and don't represent the depth and breadth of Ann and Nancy's earlier songwriting talents. Their musical catalogue on Capitol does not compare to the gems they released on the Mushroom & CBS-Portrait labels.I still listen to this album occasionally to remind me of my youth but if I want to hear the REAL Heart I listen to their earlier albums. ",3.0
" It is my opinion that Heart was never the same after the Wilson sisters dismissed lead guitarist Roger Fisher (Anne's former beau) and producer Mike Flicker. This was evident on their first album without their involvement Bebe LeStrange (80). Fisher had a co-writing credit on one track but he did not appear on the album. From that point on Heart had lost their edge. At the same time their commercial appeal was slipping. They made Private Audition (82) and Passion Works (83) but failed to have any significant hits. They were subsequently dropped from CBS (Sony) records.As a matter of survival in the record business Heart had everything riding on the success of this self-titled Capitol album. Producer Ron Nevison encouraged the Wilson sisters to use songs from outside writers and he made Heart sound like Survivor with female lead vocals. I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy most of the songs on this album. 'What About Love' 'Never' and particularly Bernie Taupin's 'These Dreams' are very catchy pop tunes. Incidentally 'These Dreams' was orignally written for Stevie Nicks who rejected it. Heart had their first number one song three more top ten singles and an additional Hot 100 hit from this record which proves my point -- this is pure pop. Of course that's not bad it's just different.For those of us who were fans from the beginning the HEART album bears little resemblance to the rocking and soulful 70's band that made the classics Dreamboat Annie (76) Little Queen (77) Magazine (78) and Dog and Butterfly (78). If you only know Heart from this 1985 pop album you owe it to yourself to hear them the way they were. ",3.0
" While this album certainly isn't the same music Heart was known for in the 70s it brought them back into the music spotlight and brought new fans. Some people who like to act self important wanna call this type of change 'selling out' but look at all the other bands of the past who refused to change - most of them are nowhere and forgotten. Very few bands of that era have a sound that maintains through time. Put 'bands of the 70s' in your search browser and see what comes up. There's maybe 5 bands on that list that continued to produce music successfully thru the 80s and 90s. And Heart is one of them. When it comes to entertainment if you wanna survive you gotta give the fans what they want. And that's what Heart did on this disc and a few more after this. ",3.0
" This is a review of the 1990 Capitol CD version of this album. In short this is a very good album but the sound quality of the CD is mediocre at best and is in need of remastering. In fact the sound quality is very weak in comparison to the excellent remastered 'Little Queen' 'Dog & Butterfly' and 'Bebe Le Strange' CDs released by Epic/Legacy. Compared to my vinyl LP purchased back when the album was first released this CD sounds quite tinny with overdone highs and a great lack of midrange.As far as the music itself this is a solid effort and was Heart's biggest seller going 5X Platinum (per Wikipedia). It was a departure from the band's earlier albums as they went through a change in record label and with that came a new producer (Ron Nevison) new sound (heavier use of synth; less use of acoustic guitar) and new songwriters (emphasis on outsiders instead of the Wilson sisters). While I prefer the older albums this is still very good and worth a listen. In fact based on relative record sales most people prefer this version of Heart to their original approach.So overall 4 stars for the music 2 stars for the sound quality giving an overall rating of 3 stars.

" Being a huge Heart fan since the release of 'Dreamboat Annie' in 1976 I was not sure what to make of this 1985 self-titled album. While I was thrilled that the 'Heart' album was such a huge success I wondered what happend to my favorite band. They were no longer the folky blusey rockin band I grew up with - - now they were a huge hit machine with lots of pop/rock hits and huge hair. This album is however expertly executed. It accomplished its goal in spades - - turn Heart into a pop/rock hit making machine. All the songs here are good and Ann and Nancy and the band are in top form. Again proving they could play anything. However the soul is gone. ",3.0

" This is somewhat of a minority viewpoint in comparison to the previous five customer reviews already written. I read this book because of the local publicity it received here in Wisconsin the fact that I have been in Peru and in Amazon region (though not the same part as Dr. Linnea) am interested in Latin American culture and speak fluent Spanish.Dr. Linnea doesn't. The one complete Spanish sentence in the book contains a major grammar error that most students wouldn't make mid-way through their first semester of college Spanish. Of the isolated Spanish words she uses she gets a couple wrong. She can be forgiven for this. She obviously managed to communicate adequately with her patients and she's a physician after all not a linguist. I'm aware this seems like nitpicking and this is not my reason for a mere 3-star review.What I find lacking in this book is emotional engagement with the reader. I liked this book passably but wanted to like it so much more. Dr. Linnea is really the only character in it and she seems to be a rather private person. She gives us her opinions much more than her feelings. Maybe this is typical of the majority of physicians. We never really get to know her patients or any other person in the book. If she develops close relationships we don't learn of them. Some patients improve and survive some die but it's a bit like a catalogue of people who barely have names or faces and come through her office (or she goes to them). I'm also interested in medicine and geography in general and a book in a similar vein that of a doctor practicing 'backwoods medicine' that is truly wonderful (and that I'd hoped this one would resemble) is Dr. Abraham Verghese's MY OWN COUNTRY. (He treats AIDS patients in Appalachia in the mid-1980s.) Perhaps he's atypical in the way he becomes personally/emotionally involved with his patients or in the way that he is able to put human faces and lives on a disease and write about it all. Dr. Linnea in spite of being a wonderful person who has done dangerous extremely outstanding work is not able (or chooses not) to do what Verghese did in his book.Unlike another customer who reviewed this I definitely don't think this was ghost-written. Dr Linnea is right there revealing not one iota more than she wants to. I think the 'problem' can be seen right in her acknowledgements when regarding her publishers she writes that they 'gave me unlimited latitude in what I wanted to say and how I wanted to say it.' Sorry but this book needed much more editorial guidance. She's a physician not a professional writer and though this effort is quite passable it could have been so much better.The book is informative educational up to a point gives a good perspective on 'jungle' medicine' vs. the US mainstream practice thereof and is culturally sensitive. (Though at one point I winced when she said that the inhabitants almost all of whom live in abysmal poverty 'seemed happy.' This made me think of 19th century slaves in the US who many contended 'seemed happy.') There are a few funny moments especially when Dr. Linnea describes w/ dead-on accuracy her encounters with the Peruvian bureaucracy redtape and corruption.All in all well worth reading but don't expect great emotional engagement or gripping human drama.

" I bought this case about 3 years ago when I graduated with my M.Arch degree. I keep it in a small pocket inside my purse which is rather protected and over time it has deteriorated. The pin that is in the hinge constantly slips out and I have to push it back in I find it difficult to open with such a small tab and the clear cover (acrylic?) has cracked in several places. I find it quite awkward to hand out cards at a moment's notice because I have to turn it just right in order to get a good grip to open it.

" David Remnick's 'Lenin's Tomb' is a book about the journalist's experiences just before and during the collapse of the USSR at the end of the 1980s. Using a chronological overview Remnick describes what the Soviet Union was like under the reign of Gorbachov (or 'Gorbachev' in US spelling) and his views on the various leaders journalists KGB officers bureaucrats dissidents and so on.Because Remnick goes almost entirely by interviews for his information the book gives a very thorough biographical view of the times but there is very little information on the general state of the country economic and social causes for the collapse and so on. Remnick's tone and style are very much like those of a tabloid investigative journalist describing people and events mostly by way of the author's opinions and what the people he interviews look and act like. This has the benefit of giving one the impression of re-living the interactions with the famous of those years but is far too shallow for any explanatory purpose.Additionally Remnick has too obvious favorites among the people involved. Gorbachov is generally shown more negatively than often in the West but that fits the overall negative appraisal given to him in Russia. But people like Yeltsin and Solzhenitsyn are praised endlessly and can practically do no wrong even though there are serious issues with both. Sakharov in particular is elevated literally to the level of a modern saint by Remnick",3.0

I spoke with an individual in customer support who stated the average probe lasts approximately one year then needs to be replaced(an error message comes up rendering the unit unusable).

" It seems that once a month we get a re-packaging of Little Richard's 1964-65 recordings. The latest but not greatest set of retreads is the above-named CD.The only selling point for Richard collectors in the uncommon mix on 'My Wheels They Are Slippin' All The Way' [aka 'My Wheel's Been Slippin''] the Country Rock number originally left on the shelf for ten years. The horn section is audible on this album opener. Track two 'It Ain't Whatcha Do' is the original flip-side of his third single for the label an under-produced dance floor offer and this reduced echo version is welcome.It's been said many times that Richard's work for this label is inconsistent but that doesn't mean that several sides aren't absolutely essential listening for *any* R & R fan or historian. There are a few masterpieces including the uptempo 'Dance What You Wanna' (co-written by Sam Cooke) and 'Talkin' ' bout Soul' (written by Sam's Manager and Richard's Manager-to-be J. W. Alexander).

Some of the remarks and anecdotes are very interesting but virtually all of them assume that you are already familiar with the plot of the particular story or novel. This is why I recommend it only for die-hard fans. It is no help at all for the reader who has read only a couple of Heinlein's works. I think there should have been at least a basic plot synopsis for each item so those folks could have been pointed to Heinlein pieces that would have been new to them that they might have found interesting.No work not even Starship Troopers or Strangers in A Strange Land gets more than three or four pages of comments (most are less than a page) and the book is only about 250 pages long.

" 'Hum Saath-Saath Hain' is reminiscent of some of the other family-centered Hindi dramas of the 1990s such as 'Hum Aapke Hain Kaun' and it preceded the very popular 'Khabi Khushi Khabhie Gham' which deals with similar themes. These themes are family unity; obedience to parents; loyalty to siblings; and the potential for family erosion when doubt and suspicion creep in.The family at the core of this film is comprised of mother father and three sons who all live happily together and work for the prosperous family business (there's also a daughter but she's already married and therefore lives with her husband's family). The family functions according to a strict but loving hierarchy in which the eldest son Vivek (Mohnish Behl) marries first and is set to inherit the top position in the family firm; the second son Prem (Salman Khan) is sent abroad to study so that he can also join the company; and the youngest son Vinod (Saif Ali Khan) is mischievous but always looks up to his elder brothers.The first two hours of this three hour film are without any major family strife or drama - the focus is on the daily functioning of the family and the pairing off of each brother with his respective sweetheart. Vivek Prem and Vinod all get engaged in turn as the couples sing dance and bat their eyelashes at each other over the course of two hours. When Preeti bakes sweets for Prem (his favorite sweets of course!) that counts as high drama. If the intricacies of life in an extended family hold no interest for you then you will likely be bored to tears. If however you enjoy delicate flirtations and the visual feast that is Hindi cinema then it will be a pleasant two hours.The twist doesn't come until the final hour. When the daughter of the family experiences some difficulties in her husband's home the mother becomes paranoid that a similar schism will occur in her own family carefully balanced as it is between three brothers and their three wives-to-be. In a moment of doubt the mother causes the very schism she's afraid of but under the pretense of protecting her two younger sons from the power of the elder (who's also only their half-brother). I'm not giving away anything shocking when I say that all will be resolved in the end since the very foundation of this film is the idea that family bonds should never be broken and this family in particular is unbreakable.All of the actors turn in fine performances; surprisingly no one actor is the star over any other. Salman Khan plays the shy gentle brother and as such his performance is more subdued than usual. Mohnish Behl is great as the always-responsible noble elder brother and Saif Ali Khan is credible as the playful responsibility-dodging youngest brother. The three women (Tabu Sonali Bendre and Karishma Kapoor) are lovely but they don't have much scope for nuance in their roles; they are all dutiful loving women who act appropriately and obediently. Not much room for drama in such idealized characterizations.In summary",3.0

" This guy is almost cut like Schwarzenegger but has no sense of humor. Decent action like some of Arnold's early works (e.g. Commando and Red Heat) but not the best acting just like them. If you got a couple hours to blow and want to see a new action movie this will fit the bill. I suggest rental as this does not have alot of replayability in my book. Even my two young stepsons that were Marines weren't impressed. A good popcorn no brainer action movie. If you own any of Schwarzenegger's movies your time would be better spent watching them again. Don't get me wrong I really hope that Cena's career in movies will continue. With time I'm sure his acting will improve as Schwartzenegger's did. Let's face it the movie had potential if the acting was better or they threw in more comedy. About the only funny thing in the movie was when one of the bad guys says 'He's like the Terminator' when talking about the Marine and then Robert Patrick who played a Terminator in 'Terminator 2' gives a steely glance at him. If this turns out to be the only movie Cena makes I have to vote for 'Chill Factor' with Skeet Ulrich or 'Firestorm' with Howie Long over this one. If they had added in more humor I think it would have worked better.Story Synopsis",3.0

" The Marine is a film about a marine that has just been discharged and is back home with his wife. When she's kidnapped by the bad guys the game is on. It's an action movie and I think most people can spot what this movie is going to be like from that description. So if you're not a person that enjoys action movies like Rambo or Commando then I can safely say that you won't enjoy this film. It's still a paint-by-numbers affair so it's doubtful you'd suddenly find yourself enjoying this type of film.But I am someone who enjoys action movies like Rambo and Commando. So I waited till I found myself in the right mood to watch an action romp and I stuck this DVD in. The movie starts out with some promise. After John Cena's character is discharged from the military he takes a job as a security guard. The scene that followed that was fairly entertaining - with Cena throwing around his weight. While that scene is entertaining it is also meant to show that Cena's character is miserable outside of marine life. This hints at some inner turmoil that is then left behind completely and never again brought up in the film.Robert Patrick does a great job as the bad guy. I thought he was very good. I did not care for his henchmen as they didn't seem to bring anything to the table. Likewise John Cena is not an actor. He doesn't need to be in an action movie if the plot is compelling but it's really not. There aren't any memorable action scenes that stick out in my mind as I reflect back so all I am recalling is the awkward delivery that John Cena had. I also didn't care for his character's wife; who was very attractive but had a quality about her that said there was nothing going on upstairs. The pair is not a couple who are developed characters; the wife especially comes off as an arrogant shrew and so as a viewer I'm not invested in the film when she is kidnapped.All in all this movie would have been a better film as a focus on Robert Patrick's jewelery store heist and escape. That was much more interesting than The Marine and his walk through a swamp. But that's just my opinion.sincerelyR.C. ",3.0
" The storyline is good but developing the characters of the 'bad guys' was quite pathetic. No depth no brains just blow up things at random and find things to bicker and whine about... Especially trying to bring racism into the fray... lets blame the senseless violence on the 'black guy'. The character happened to be a black guy and had a penchant for self-destruction... and blowing everything else up as well. I personally found that little whining episode offensive no matter how you chose to interpret it.The character development of John Triton was pretty good but established him as more of a loose cannon rather than a highly skilled combat individual. This is further reinforced when he gets into fights and essentially uses his face to block many of the punches. That may work in the WWE but does not establish a character who is supposed to be highly skilled in hand/hand combat.Some of the scenes in the movie seemed to be filler to get minutes. Especially his encounter with the two poachers while running through the swamp.However the movie still managed to be fun to watch once I was able to adjust my expectations for the movie to be WWE entertainment and not as a full action movie.Overall you can enjoy this movie if you choose to it isn't a total loss but neither is it a winner.

" Okay I will admitt that I love BAD movies. Boy did I pick a doosy! Skip the plot skip the hero take a quick look at the wife in her bra then cheer for the bad guys! The best acting and lines are with the baddies. I just loved their robbery and the lines there are great. Picture the bad guys running knee deep in mud in a swamp. Then the head bad guy stops to answer his cell phone. He then tells his partner on the other end that the deal is off. He then stops that conversation and answer his call waiting. Now he says'Does that include the sports package and HBO?' Don't get me started on 'rock candy' and black guys and mini vans. I was truly soory when they bad dudes all died.

" What a surprise. This film contains outstanding dialog. It's pretty funny. It does get boring later in the film perhaps there's a lack of content or grounding and the outstanding dialog seems to become average. The film makers seem to understand our boredom and presto change-o many car crashes and explosions. Their trickery seems to work.I will say this film does nothing for race relations. Especially if you take the film makers seriously. The black villain in the story is such a stereo-type of the bad guy obsessed with getting in touch with his blackness. Arch-type - that's what he is. Not a stereotype but a stand in for all African Americans or rather the personification of a certain ideology. Perhaps just a reality. This may be done intentionally that's my opinion. He's not shown to be a reliable character in the film. Just be a person not a Black man. Perhaps just avoid black men if possible. . . ? Building understanding. . . perhaps - but this film does nothing to improve race relations. Who said the Marines are about better race relations? At least we'd like to imagine they aren't. ",3.0

" Some might say that professional wrestlers are already actors to some extent. WWE Studios is dedicated to expanding the careers of those with acting talent from the ring to the big screen. As a champion John Cena brought an imposing physical presence rugged good looks and a certain flair for the dramatic to his wrestling and music endeavors. The Marine (2006) is a vehicle designed to showcase Cena's talents and he acquits himself well enough in his big screen debut an explosive and exciting but still rather unremarkable action thriller.Cena is ex-Marine John Triton discharged from the service for disobeying orders while on a mission in Iraq. Returning stateside Triton finds civilian life a little rough and decides to get away from it all for a while heading into the South Carolina mountains with his wife Kate (Kelly Carlson Nip/Tuck).At a roadside gas station a gang of thieves on the run ambush a couple of highway patrolmen. With their vehicle damaged the criminals led by Rome (Robert Patrick) and his lieutenant Angela (Abigail Bianca) slug John kidnap Kate and hit the road in Triton's SUV. Triton gives chase in the patrol car in what is the action highlight of the first half of the film. The gang is left travelling on foot through the swamp with Triton on their trail. The group make their way to a safe house. Triton arrives and takes out some of the gang but Rome sets off and explosion and makes his escape. Triton again has to dodge a fireball and after borrowing a police speedboat finally catches up to Rome. Up until the finish Cena's fight scenes are fairly routine but the battle between Cena and Patrick finally generates a few sparks.Although the story is rather simplistic and uncomplicated The Marine does entertain and provides the requisite opportunities for John Cena to flex his muscles and exercise his fledgling acting skills. Robert Patrick (The Unit Terminator 2) is a known talent and brings some humor and class to the production and he has enough physical stature to take on Cena. Kelly Carlson (who should be in more films) and Australian Abigail Bianca mix it up in a couple of spirited fights.Working with director Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger Die Hard 2) the acting potential that is shown here is more fully realized in Cena's next film 12 Rounds (2009). Though he is still chasing after a girl Cena's character is more well rounded and the film features more of Cena doing his thing behind the wheel of a vehicle. ",3.0

" The Marine is about a marine (John Cena) who is kicked out due to not following orders well. He then gets fired from his security job after man handling a jerk. He then stresses to his friend that 'being a marine is what he did best'. Then on a trip with his wife she's taken hostage by jewel thieves. They carry big guns and blow stuff up but while acting like the kind of baffoons you'd see in a Home Alone movie. Robert Patrick is cool as the leader of the bad guys but he gets so many goofy lines that it's hard to take him seriously. I think he's a wasted actor. I mean his performance in Walk the Line and other serious roles show that. Plus no he did not kill the X-Files like many fans say. The show trying to continue without Mulder killed the X-Files. He was pretty good in it.Anyway this movie doesn't know if it's an action thriller or action comedy. Plus I don't know why people praise the stunts. It's like wannabe Transporter or Transporter 2 type action. Plus with so many huge explosions you'd think that at least one person would die in them. But John Cena escapes every huge explosion without a mark on him.We also have seen how many movies where the heroe takes one bad guy at a time as one after another goes looking for him one after another. It worked a lot better for Die Hrad than it does for this film though. Now the good about the movie. It offers sexy women and although I'm not the biggest John Cena fan I can't say he's a bad action star. He has the right look even if he does basically give a one note performance. He's a marine and he makes sure we think of him as nothing but a marine. The script also makes sure we just think of him as nothing but a dangerous marine that loves his wife too. Since that's all we ever learn about him. It's just a fast paced brainless action film so it doesn't need any character build-up. ",3.0

" This film promised lots of action. It delivered. The numerous explosions made a great spectacle. Commercial director John Bonito helmed his first feature. He keeps the pacing going well. I had no clue who John Cena was and wondered how he grabbed an action lead. After seeing the DVD extras of his wrestling career I understand how he was cast and remembered him from channel surfing. His reactions are fairly wooden without many levels that we'd expect from a more experienced actor. But he gets an 'A' for effort and completed many of his own stunts.Robert Patrick who was the bad guy in 'Terminator 2",3.0
" In the Marine John Cena plays a discharged marine who tracks down the jewel thieves that kidnapped his wife. It draws inevitable comparisons to Commando Die Hard and countless other action flics - and it doesn't shy away from that. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously and throws in knowing references to other 'blow-em up' films [including a Terminator line for the sake of lead baddie Robert Patrick]. There's nothing new or really eye popping to see here. It is a formula driven testerone fest that does all the usual things that movies like this are supposed to do and it is all pulled off fairly well. Don't go into it expecting Bourne-like intrigue; however don't be surprised if you find yourself thinking how much John Cena looks like Bourne actor Matt Damon from the neck up. If there were a Bourne spoof Cena would be a no-brainer to play the title character. ",3.0

" This is rather fun to watch although it is completely over the top in being unrealistic.Although most action shows tend to be extreme in the situations that the star survives and thrives in this one puts virtually all others to shame in that regard. That is unfortunate as it is a storyline that could have proven to be a great movie if it were written better.It features John Triton (John Cena) as a former Marine who was kicked out of the Corps for disobeying an order. Of course had he obeyed the order many American lives would have been lost. Nevertheless he was scapegoated and discharged.One day he and his wife Kate (Kelly Carlson) are at a convenience store when a group of thugs kills a cop. They then take Kate hostage which proves to be a very poor decision for them as John is a commando the makes Rambo look like a wimp in comparison. The bad guys are about to have a very bad day indeed.This really could have been a great show but there are way too many extreme fires/explosions that get Triton. If the writers would have toned that part down just a bit this might have been a four or even a five star show. Hardcore actions fans will probably enjoy it but it comes off as a bit too hokey for many others. ",3.0
" John Cena was very realisitic made the part genuine and intriguing. He really portrayed a man going out of his mind with anger at his wife being kidnapped. At the same time he was clever and covert. It is unfortunate that with his talent and great looks he was given a substandard plot. He has untapped skills and a charisma that could make him a tremendous movie star in a story that is unique and capitalizes on his expertise. ",3.0
" The special effects were great and the production is pretty darn good. By the end of the movie you realize the hero should've died a long time ago but then again that's what action movies are all about. Near the end he takes a sledgehammer to the gut which would've pretty much put most people out of commission. He's nearly blown up 3 times lives through a car chase where the car ends up being swiss cheese torn to pieces. The acting wasn't too bad but they tried to put humor in that I think only a WWE fan would appreciate. There was one funny moment I liked that referenced Terminator. It's a decent action movie if you just put logic aside and enjoy the ride. I'm not a wrestling fan so most of actors were unknown to me. It's worth a rent just for the car chase. ",3.0

" Having suffered the derision of fellow sci-fi fans for many years I recently picked up the Foundation Trilogy for the first time; I was actually pretty disappointed by my first exposure to Asimov's longer works. Obviously the man is one of the renowned masters of science fiction because he got there first",3.0
" Foundation came to me highly recommended. I am not new to science fiction but I have not read that much of this genre. I was looking forward to something that would really blow my mind away. though I admired several things about the book and thought it was a nice read I am not going to read the other books in this series. Coming away from this book I felt it was good but not much more. There were several ways in which I clearly found the book to be lacking. Though Asimov's style is surely concise and highly readable he views plot as the central element to his writing at the expense of other aspects of great fiction that really should have been incorporated. I will outline these at length because it appears that the book's praises are already sung widely.First there is not much character development. Characters are presented merely to accomplish a historical event in the flow of the story. We get a feel for the characters not as real people but as actors on the stage of world history. Though the reader admires the nerve and intellect behind each of these heroes there is little else that makes them interesting. While this kind of presentation of characters may work in movie adaptations or history textbooks I like to view my characters as a little more than men at work. Everybody is always scheming there's not much downtime or description of what day-to-day life is like with these guys so far in the future such far-off planets.Secondly there is a lack of real meaning or symbolism that defines great books. The closest we get to intrinsic meaning is the description of the false religion that Salvor Hardin invents. And this only helps us understand what the author probably thinks about organized religion. The all-importance of nuclear energy also seems like propaganda to get ther reader to 'understand' how important it will be in our era with no attention paid to other kinds of fascinating technology that may exist in the future such as super-intellect robotics biotechnology etc. I don't know if Asimov was just lacking in creativity because with the exception of his brilliant description of the mother planet Trantor the only thing different between this far off future and nowadays is the ability to jump through space.Thirdly romance does not play a role in the book. There no women in the book which means there can be no romantic intrigue or world events influenced by a woman. Also there is no sense of wonder and excitement that a reader surely hopes to get when they enter an author's imagination. The landscape of these far off worlds is sparesely and hardly described. We spend much of our time in staterooms.On the other hand if you like books that are centered on brilliant leaders of nation-states and how their decisions affect the course of history you will like this book. If you are fascinated by the economic political and sociological macroforces that shape history you will like this book. If you're more about the game than the players you will like this book. ",3.0
" The main reason I read sci-fi is to visualize strange new worlds and places. Although a good book I didn't really get a good mental picture of the different worlds involved in it except Trantor in the very beginning of the book. It was mostly about people and politics with very little of the landscapes they lived in. I guess that is why I liked the Dune and Hyperion series so much. ",3.0
" Being a science fiction fan for some years I picked up a copy of Foundation after hearing wonderful things about this series and loving I Robot. On the whole I think I Robot is a better read largely because I got to know and empathize with the characters in that set of stories more which is my main criticism of this book.Nevertheless Foundation is still very worthwhile and while I wouldn't recommend this book to everyone there are certain friends who I think would love it - it's for a select audience who loves science fiction and/or Isaac Asimov. I am going to continue on with the series - and we'll see how it goes! ",3.0
" The key to enjoying the original Foundation trilogy is to understand that the three novels which make up the 'trilogy' are not really novels. They are a series of interconnected stories written over time. Foundation is actually 5 short stories. Because of this the stories vary in quality.The second book Foundation and Empire is actually two stories. The first is called The General and tells the story of the empire's last ditch effort to conquer the foundation. The weakness of the first story is that all the action takes place off page. We never see any of the actual combat we just read the characters talking about it. Also the resolution comes way too quickly. It feels like Asimov had reached his page limit and decided to end the story as quickly as he could.The second story called The Mule is the real draw here. All the previous stories presented a challege for the foundation to overcome. However it was always expected that the foundation would triumph based on the long term scientific predictions of its founder. The Mule throws in a variable that was not predicted. The appearance of a mutant who swiftly moves to conquer the various planets left in the wake of the old empire's collapse. Ultimately he sets his sights on the foundation. The best part of the story is a visit to the ruins of the planet Trantor. Former capital of the galactic empire.Having finished this second book I have come to realize that the Foundation trilogy while entertaining is certainly not Asimov's best work. Time is not always kind to science fiction and all of these early stories were written before 1950 when Asimov was still a young writer. I plan to continue on to the next book but I no longer expect to be overwhelmed by the classic status these stories have achieved. ",3.0
" I like Foundation because it's a solid piece of sci-fi from olden days. (George Lucas's stealing of Asimov's city-planet for his Coruscant - tsk tsk Georgie - amazed me most.) Foundation does have peculiarities. People hundreds of thousands of years in the future speak like us. They use phrases like us. They also have the same atomic technology as people did in the 1950s. Asimov got a bit lazy here; he could've imagined something cooler than nukes. The galaxy is a metaphor for a crumbling Roman empire. Perhaps Terminus is Ireland. As for A's style I found his use of long adverbs rather funny. In sum a good book if you can ignore this stuff. ",3.0
" I know I'll take some major heat in saying this but I wasn't that impressed with this beloved classic. Oh the idea intrigues me surely that of humankind eons in the future existing across the galaxy on a multitude of worlds so far removed from earth that eminent masters of science themselves debate whether earth was even the planet where human life began but once the dust settled from an idea that lofty what did Asimov really DO with it? He used it for unexciting little tales of science v. military might. I love the parallel between the fall of this vast space empire and the fall of Rome. The way bands of scientists struggled in a dark age to keep the light of knowledge alive was thought-provoking (which is high praise in my lexicon) but this was backdrop and the plot Asimov employed in telling the story of all this was (sorry to say) dull slow simple and unworthy of the imaginative concepts he thought up in his setting for this tale of knowledge overcoming strength of arms. I haven't read the later Foundation novels so maybe they're the ones where the brilliance of the series exists but I found this book from Sci-Fi's golden age so demanding on my patience that I didn't finish it the first time I tried to read it and barely made it to the end the second time. I wish I shared the glowing praise for this classic that millions of others claim they feel but to be honest I just don't. ",3.0
" Re-reading Foundation showed it to be rather dated in its depiction of an advanced galactic empire rooted in its 1940s science fiction environment. The overall plot such as it is betrays the novel's origins as separate short stories and the characters tend to be wooden. Foundation and Empire the next book in Asimov's original Foundation trilogy is a much better novel especially in its depiction of the character of the Mule. However the concept of psychohistory introduced in this work is fascinating and the key to the other books by Asimov and others describing past and future developments in the Foundation universe.

" The second of the first Foundation trilogy Foundation and Empire was originally published in 1952. Originally published as two novellas in Astounding Science Fiction 'The General' and 'The Mule' cover the next two periods when the Foundation receives its first full-force attacks.In 'The General' the Galactic Empire is well on its way to its inevitable end but under the command of General Bel Riose an attack is planned against the Foundation. Bel Riose has gone mad with power and will stop at nothing to obliterate the Foundation somehow believing they are behind the fall of the empire. He amounts huge forces if armored gunships with plans wipe the Foundation from the galaxy. But one man from the Foundation knows about this and he also knows knowledge is power and since the Foundation is soon as that which has all the knowledge he knows Bel Riose can be stopped so long as he gets to the Emperor before the general attacks.In 'The Mule' the Galactic Empire has fallen into a selection of barbaric kingdoms while the Foundation has become strong and powerful but also full of corruption composed of approximately thirty outer planets. But there is corruption within the ranks and things are stirring within the Foundation's empire. Meanwhile there is a new leader who has rise an enigmatic mutant known as 'The Mule' who has only known scorn and suffering and is a hardened creature who respects no one but he also has the ability to read and control people's emotions. It is up to two Foundation citizens Toran and Bayta Darell along with the Foundation's only psychologist Ebling Mis and a strange refugee clown 'Magnifico Giganticus' to search for the Second Foundation set up by Hari Seldon originally when the Foundation was created and stop this 'Mule.'Originally written on February 5 2011 Alex C.

" Isaac Asimov was one of the greatest science fiction minds of the twentieth century. He was NOT however a great writer.

The first couple are very good but the last few are pretty uninteresting. The writing is uneven dialogue is unrealistic and characters are wooden and one-dimensional.

" That's not saying much since I thought that 'Foundation' was pretty poor.'Foundation and Empire' was pretty good but still lacked in certainareas - mainly character development and also the first third of thebook had a very weak story line. The whole battle with the Empire bythe Foundation was very very weak I cannot stress that enough. Maybe Iwas just hoping for an epic battle between the renegade Foundation andthe dying Empire. Nothing really happened to spur the victory of theFoundation there wasn't even really a battle. But I guess that mightbe the point that Asimov was making since Seldon predicted the choicesand decisions of the Emperor about the passion that the characters hadfor the battle. It wasn't even a battle between the Empire it was somemission designed and orchestrated by some general in the navy thatthought it would be a good idea to take over the Foundation.This book also lacked in strong characterizations but not as much asthe first 'Foundation' by a long shot. The last two thirds of the bookstick with the same characters the whole time. It also enters apowerful mutant the Mule. I won't give much away about the Mule andhis plans because I don't want to spoil the book but it sets up for thesequel 'Second Foundation.' Once again the idea of the Mule is a goodidea but is somewhat poorly executed until the ened when everything isexplained about the effects the Mule has on the Foundation and thepeople in the main storyline.Get ready for 'Second Foundation' because it will probably be the bestof the first trilogy.

My final complaint about FOUNDATION is that most of the characters are presented as simple minded. I might read the rest of the books in this series only because I have been told they get better. However FOUNDATION is just an average read. ",3.0

" While I believe that Asimov was a great science fiction author I was disappointed in this book and the whole series. To me science fiction is about new ideas of the future and an exciting story. While the idea of a falling society where some foresee the downfall of its society and plan to minimise the impact is interesting it could have been staged as well in the past. One can tell that the book has been written some while ago and it is missing the action and technologies I want to read about in a science fiction book today. For me personally the book is also very slow paced and not engaging enough to make me want to continue reading it but rather read some chapters at a time and then I can put it down for weeks since I am not engaged enough to read further. Still I am kind of interested in how the series continues and finally ends but not interested enough that I have to use every free minute reading it. I find it hard to judge this book and if you are into science fiction I believe you just have to give it a try. Yes I rated it only three stars but rating this book in a one dimensional fashion doesn't do its justice since I believe it is still a very good book but just not what I was expecting of a science fiction and wanted to read. I personally prefer a Peter Hamilton Stephen Baxter or Andreas Eschbach for example. ",3.0
" A GALACTIC EMPIRE IS PREDICTED TO LIE IN RUINS IN THE FUTURE BY THE GREAT PSYCHOHISTORIAN- HARI SELDON.the commission of public safety approves of the seldon plan to minimise the worst of what was to come. two foundations are set up at opposite ends of the galaxy.the first guards the secrets of psychohistory -of this planet nothing could be told. the second -TERMINUS- is the pawn in the master plan of hari seldon. the inhabitants of TERMINUS are busy writing the encyclopaedia galactica.and going on with their lives. in the 50th year of the landing of humans on the planet the first crises is faced...the first SELDON CRISES. this is when the high & mighty of planet terminus sees seldon appear in the time capsule. other crisises follow and they are dealt with great diplomacy. this story is the story of a disintegrating galactic empireand that of a lone planet on the outet rims of the galaxy trying to survive in a hostile world of barbaric planets with dictators as the rulers.it is the story of a planet inhabited by the best brains in the galaxy and how they emerge as diplomats from their original occupations of scientists and scholers. asimov is brilliant in sketching the slow but steady evolution of a world of scientists into a world of future rulers. though the jump between great lengths of time makes us feel as if we've experienced a jump through hyper space. a good book to lay one's hands on if one likes to zoom into the future. a book for all no doubt asimov's foundation is the perfect start for the following books of the foundation saga. happy reading.

" First I read quite a bit from all genres primarily to expand my world. Foundation is a very good series but here's a few reasons why this book might not expand *your* world",3.0
" Foundation is completely a story of ideas the characters are completely servants to the scifi galaxy Asimov has created. The story is of a galaxy in a situation and not a character in a situation. I think the idea he created was amazing but I prefer stories about characters and because he originally wrote the stories for a magazine and later combined them which destroyed the flow of the storyRich ",3.0
" I was expecting so much more from this book as it was once awarded best sci-fi series ever. It was good but not that great. Maybe in the 1950's it was the best of sci-fi but compared to today's standards it was a little boring and out of date. It contains long dialogs and a lot of politics wrapped in a sci-fi environment. It doesn't contain fascinating worlds and interesting glimpses of the future. There's not a lot of action but I have to admit the dialog is pretty good. If you're into nostalgia politics and interesting dialog this book is for you. ",3.0
" From everything I've heard about this book I was really excited to read it. After reading the first half in a few days then forcing myself to finish the second half after taking a two week break I can honestly say that I found it to be a real let down.The main theme was about the only part I liked. Humanity has colonized the stars and controls everything blah blah blah but a really smart guy and his friends do some math equations and figure out that the currently all-powerful and all-encompassing Empire is doomed to collapse and thrust mankind thousands of years back to a 'barbaric' state. His solution is to gather all the great minds of the day and create an educated stronghold on the edge of the galaxy to serve as a becon of hope and enlightnenment to supposedly shorten the time mankind has to spend in the dark ages.Their main goal is to create an encyclopedia that pretty much contains every biit of information ever learned. Ever. (wikipedia)Well it turns turns out that several years after the creation of Foundation the shallow characters are riddeled with 'crises'. Good thing the late creator appears via prerecorded videos at strategic times to offer advice to the indistinguishable residents and assures them that he did some math problems fifty years ago and discovered that everyting with work itself out. This is the basis for the rest of the book.The characters are dull boring and super confident in everything they do because some dead guys math and future predictions will save them all.The second half of the book proved to be slightly more interesting but not much ",3.0
" The first thing to understand about Foundation is that it isn't really a novel. It is a collection of 5 connected short stories (The Psychohistorians The Encyclopedists The Mayors The Traders & The Merchant Princes) written in the 1940s for publication in Astounding Science Fiction Magazine. The first story in the book was actually written a few years later for repackaging the stories as the first novel in what would eventually become the Foundation trilogy (later expanded with additional books).The galactic empire is rotting. After it collapses there will follow 30000 years of barbarism. Nothing can prevent the collapse but Hari Seldon believes that the subsequent dark ages can be contained to 1000 years if the proper steps are taken. To achieve this he sets up the Foundation at the very fringes of the empire. The first two stories are far and away the best in the book and are worth the price of admission by themselves. This is because they deal directly with the central premise which is a fantastic idea.Things go downhill with the next two stories. In particular The Traders seems completely unnecessary. Things pick up a bit with the final chapter.Taken as a whole Foundation is less than the sum of its parts. I don't think it is the unrivaled masterpiece that many make it out to be. I would definitely go in with an open mind and lowered expectations.However as I mentioned earlier the idea is fantastic and promises much more and better to come. I will definitely be checking out the next book in the series. ",3.0
" Foundation and Empire is basically a continuation of Foundation. There really isn't a new plot just new problems for the Foundation to deal with. Foundation and Empire is pretty good but without the novelty of the new ideas presented in Foundation it is a bit flat.

" I recently re-read this classic work of science fiction and was pleasantly surprised to find it's still relevant today. The characters and language are a bit creaky but the social issues Asimov raises are sound. Under what conditions is it ethical for a self-appointed academic elite to hoodwink and trick the general population for their own good? Phrased that way the answer seems obvious -- under no conditions at all? -- but what if it really IS for their own good and if disaster is the alternative?We don't have any better answers to those questions today than we did 70 years ago when Asimov was writing.

" In my initial read of this book I stuck with it because it is a classic and everyone loves it.

So far the second trip through this book is much more enjoyable than my first slow trip. ",3.0
" When a book is slated as one of the greatest Sci-Fi novels of our time it should be extremely hard to criticize. Unfortunately I found The Foundation to have more than a few flaws which actually made it a chore to read. Considering that it beat out 'The Lord of the Rings' for the Hugo Award in 1965 for best All-Time Series which is why I decided read it makes it even more insufferable in my opinion. Simply look at how momentous LOTR's has become over The Foundation in our culture and you can begin to see how it is obviously lacking something. So why does it fall short ? Well the primary reason is the story line jumps vast amounts of time chapter to chapter which even though I found refreshing it gives the reader a completely new set of characters in different settings which receive little to no development. So ultimately the visual depth as well as character depth which I find so alluring about Sci-Fi is ultimately lacking leaving little for the imagination to grasp on to. What this does do though is leave room for what I believe Asimov wanted the reader to really experience which is the psychohistorical themes built upon long term economic strategy which was wonderfully orchestrated and second to none. The thing that gets me is considering that is the focus of the story it could have just as easily taken place in the 1800's and 1900's and be based on oil or guns instead of nuclear power. Don't get me wrong the story is intriguing but if you are looking for a visually stimulating Sci-Fi book I would look elsewhere...or you can just wait for the feature film in 2013. ",3.0

FTL antigravity flying cars walnut-sized nuclear reactors laser pistols personal and city force shields egregious use of energy in the form of anti-gravity elevators) and the psychohistorian-predicts-future-events-to-the-day plot was dumb--not to mention the idea of civilizations with FTL ships incapable of harnessing nuclear power. With repeated suspensions of disbelief it was pleasant enough. The characters were not such nitwits as those of 'Prelude to Fdn.' No need to read his other books.* after reading If the Universe is Teeming with Aliens...Where is Everybody?",3.0
" This may be a classic and I may be a science fiction fan but read Asimov's 'The Gods Themselves' instead of this. His later work is definitely better. 'Foundation and Empire' is like its predecessor ('Foundation') in that you get several stories told in different periods throughout Foundation history. Everything Asimov has come up with in these books is fundamentally good sci-fi story stuff but the lack of character development makes you think while you're reading 'Why am I reading this?' I'll read the last in the trilogy ('Second Foundation') but that's as far as I'm going to go with these.For great sci-fi read 'Hyperion' 'Fall of Hyperion' 'Ender's Game' 'Childhood's End' '2001",3.0
" Asimov's entire line of work and namely the 'Foundation' novels have long been considered by some to be the gold-standard of science fiction. As an avid reader of the genre I felt implied to give the series a whirl to see what all the fuss is about and to finally spend some time with one of the grand-daddies of the golden age. So I bought 'Foundation' along with the other two novels in the original trilogy and away I went.Very boring. Very dry. Very forgettable. The problem here I think is that while Asimov had some very fantastic ideas floating around in that pioneering noggin of his he was not exactly the best at nurturing them into full-form on the page. Thus we have a series of novels that read much more like outlines of a stronger and more fleshed-out epic. The setting is grand the characters are intriguing. The plot is one for the ages. The final product however does little justice to these ideas and I found that to be vastly disappointing. All throughout I wanted more. I wanted more world-building - not necessarily technobabble and meandering Dickenson discription but at least more insight into the nature of this vast civilization apparently on the brink of collapse. Very much the same with the characters - I wanted to sympathize with Hari Seldon as he worked to keep knowledge alive in the face of ignorance but it was so hard to do so when he was presented as little more than a piece of animated cardboard. I was thinking constantly about what could have been and that put a damper on the overall effect.I think the ideas and character tropes Asimov put forth in his trilogy have been worked with by other authors and brought to life far more successfully in the years since its initial release. Novels that come to mind are Dan Simmons's awe-inspiring 'Hyperion' series and Neal Stephenson's bulky 'Anathem'. In these books great ideas are coupled with great writing. The results as much as it hurts me to say it put Asimov's original to shame.'Foundation' is a great series to read if you want to witness science fiction as it was in its infantile and supposedly-golden age. But I think that it#s nevertheless important to understand that pioneering ideas can further develop and be presented in far-superior ways as the years progress. Such is the case here. Imaginative but slow and dated. Should most certainly remain in print and continue to be read but I do not think it is the gold-standard classic it has been made out to be. Others have done much better. ",3.0
" I used to be a big fan. Somehow the first season wasn't what I remembered. Still John Ritter saved it all. I still am buying season 2. ",3.0
" I was reluctant to buy this disc because of its high price/few episodes ratio. (Come on 'All in the Family' gets 26 episodes for $30 that's under $1 per episode and that's how it should be for all TV!) However as a proceed of the purchase (how much they won't tell us hmmmm...) goes to a charity John Ritter adored I broke down tonight and bought it.After the ubiquitous FBI screen disappears I was greeted with a menu. Ignore the naysayers there is nothing wrong with how this menu works and I've used far far worse in my 300 movie collection. I rather like the menu... And the fact they have a menu option telling us of the Spring 2004 release for season 2 made my day it's nice to see they'll put out this series for the fans.Now for the transfer. Audio quality is superb well restored. Video quality is a different story. Upon freeze-framing it's very clear that despite doing a good job at restoring the master tapes they did a rather poor transfering the video to DVD. (You HDTV fans out there may not like watching this on your sets... and by 1996 the FCC is pulling the plug on current broadcast standards...) I can think of 2 reasons why the video looks as poor as it does but it suffices to say that the end result is a video image that looks needlessly grainy; broadcast video technology of the time never ever looked this bad. But while not as bad as VHS consumer quality videotape it is well below acceptable DVD quality. (for another example of what not to do in terms of transfrring video quality onto DVD check out the dithering used in 'The Best of the Chris Rock Show' - yuck!) But given the price of this disc and that 'All in the Family' costs less per episode and yet looks far better (despite NOT having had its master tapes restored) I'm knocking 2 points off. DVD video should not ever look this grainy in a freeze-frame. (it is bearable when things in motion but be prepared for a shock if you're a 'quality freak'.)6 episodes. I was pondering the same issue why not have a season 1 + 2 box set? But then we'd have to wait until spring and I hate waiting though I would have if the video looked better. Besides these episodes are HILARIOUS. The gags the double entendres the Ropers... it's all there. And when you are laughing so much you start to cry and get a stomachache you know you're watching a winner of a show that's well written and well cast. No wonder 'Three's Company' became a success so quickly. As other reviewers here and other websites post plot synopses and reviews I won't here. (well 'No Dogs No Children' was probably my favorite of the bunch especially the scene where Chrissy and Jack are in the kitchen feeding the puppy...)And the real downfall is John Ritter died an untimely death.

" Three's Company is about as overrated as a TV show can get. First of all every single episode is about the same. How many episodes can be written on a simple misunderstanding? John Ritter was talented but this show caused him to be castwritten for the rest of his life. The guy acted gay just a little 'too' well if you ask me. The best you can say about this show is that Suzanne Somers used to jump around and jiggle without a bra.Don't be fooled by the cover. Joyce DeWitt did not look this hot until much later in the show. For now she still has the dippy-doo haircut and has the sex appeal of a cactus. The producers of the show didn't make her sexy until Suzanne left.'Larry' the used car salesman upstairs may have played a ladie's man but he was just plain scary like a werewolf. When was that hairstyle ever popular? His eyebrows seemed to reach out and grab people. The guy was as hairy as a rug too. Just looking at his arms you couldn't tell what race he was.Well John died recently while making a show with the sexiest woman on television Katey Sagal. People are saying this DVD release is a tribute to John. Poo poo I say. If Three's Company needed a much needed tribute it was to the great Norman Fell aka Mr. Roper. He was funnier than four John Ritters. I mean c'mon he had lines like 'Hey it's easy to find my wife on a nude beach she's the one that looks like her socks are rolled down!' Now that is humor my friends. So if you must buy this DVD buy it for an overlooked comedian the late great Norman Fell. ",3.0
" I expected so much from Townsend after reading a few of his other stories. However there is less bdsm content than I expected and more political/social commentary. Not a bad thing if one is more aware of the politics and social environment of the gay community in the 1970s but hard to follow and identify with otherwise. I had difficulty empathizing with any of the characters -- perhaps part of that lies with the fact that there are so many characters in the story.

" Who wouldn't watch a movie that had Mel Gibson wearing obscenely tight leather trousers and looking scarily young?Before The Passion was brought to the attention of film buffs and the press there was Lethal Weapon. And before that Mel Gibson made his name in the Mad Max movies.There's nothing on the DVD I got for my birthday not even a trailer. And I hate watching DVDs with no trailers. I'm fussy me. So I wasn't sure what to expect or what the film was exactly about. All I knew was that my mum couldn't wait to watch it and was drooling (along with me) when Mel Gibson appeared shirtless.Before the amount of money that was spent in the car chase along a freeway in Matrix Reloaded there was this. A simple but still effective car chase which introduces you very briefly to Max. I don't see the point in spending loads of money when all you need is a bunch of cars that can be trashed and a camera.Then you get to see that Max has a pretty young wife and a young child. You can almost see how the rest of the movie pans out after that. It's pretty obvious he's not mad until something really traumatic happens. I was expecting the whole growling throwing stuff but instead he seemed relatively calm - except for the sweat on his face.It's NOT obvious that this movie could get another two sequels out of it. Maybe one sequel but two? And the latter featuring Tina Turner of all people. And there's rumoured to be a fourth along with a fourth Die Hard and god knows what else. Something tells me Mel Gibson won't fit into those trousers!If you think this is going to be a movie based on revenge you're wrong. The revenge part doesn't start until about half an hour before the end.It will be interesting to see the sequels. To be honest this film did nothing for me - unless you count the tight trousers!

" In 1981 THE ROAD WARRIOR was released in to the United States and became an instant hit but George Miller's story of angry cop Max begins with his 1979 classic MAD MAX.Mel Gibson plays the title character 'Mad' Max Rockatansky a cop in a postapocalyptic future (when exactly isn't specified). He's the best cop around patroling the highways for speed-hungry gang members. Well after his best friend is killed and Max steps in the gang gets a little mad. In the end Max (now gone a little beyond Mad) sets out to avenge the death of his wife and infant child both killed by the gang.MAD MAX is a sci-fi classic that spawned one of the best-loved sci-fi series of all-time. Miller's directing style brings the needed impact to the seemingly dead futuristic earth. Gibson is also good in his star-making role (look at how young he is...wow!) - plus Brian May (not the Queen Brian May) contributes a good score.Top-notch sci-fi action entertainment and one of the greatest (and funnest) films to come out of Australia.

" In a post-apocalyptic Australia Max (Mel Gibson) and his fellow officers try to keep order on the highways as nihilistic biker gangs grow ever bolder. We are given the definite impression that the final bastions of civilization are on their last legs as chaos encroaches.This film presents intriguing characters and a suitably bleak scenario. It starts strong but it loses its energy before the end. Perhaps I was spoiled by seeing the classic action sequel 'The Road Warrior' first. When Max goes mad at the end of this first film director George Miller doesn't set the action sequences up very well or provide much of a payoff. The most exciting set pieces actually come much earlier in the movie. However his next film will prove that he can be a master of action. ",3.0
" This film is the prequel to the amazingly good 'The Road Warrior'. I've read that 'Mad Max' has the highest return on investment of any film ever made ($100K to make $100M in revenue generated); however upon watching this movie you will immediately be struck by its very low budget look and feel. If you've already watched 'The Road Warrior' you may want to watch this one to see where RW has its roots but you really need to watch RW first. Leonard Maltin (in his RW review) states that Mad Max is at least as good as RW; he is crazy. MM is a great movie for having been made for $100K but RW is a GREAT MOVIE period. One more thing this film is dubbed with American voices because someone in their infinite wisdom thought Americans wouldn't be able to understand Australian accents. This was a big mistake as the American voice actors invariably overacted in their dubbing. ",3.0
" I don't recommend this edition. Ok the picture is good and the Australian language track is quite cool but the movie is cut.In the scene in which Max visits the burned Goose in hospital has been censored meaning Goose's burned body isn't shown. Ok maybe that's something not everybody wants to see but if I buy a special edition I expect to see the whole movie. ",3.0
" It's not altogether surprising that Mad Max got such short shrift when it came out Stateside with an unfortunate dubbing job to eliminate the `Strine accents so American International could pretend it was an American film (Mel Gibson suffered perhaps a worse indignity with his screen credit moved to last position just before the lab credit on the trailers). Much of what people remember and love about Max is delivered in the sequel rather than this first outing. Indeed at times it feels more like a blueprint than a proper movie and Gibson barely registers in the surprisingly little screen time he has - the villains who all seem to be doing either premature Danny Huston impersonations or somewhat more timely German New Romantic turns make much more of an impression. Not only do huge sections of the film keep him offscreen but he makes little impact in his underwritten role when he is on. In many ways this is just a first low-budget draft of Max's world - civilization hasn't entirely crumbled yet and the precious juice is still flowing even if parts are getting hard to find. Still the car stunts are good if somewhat thin on the ground but this is one case where the sequels are definitely better.MGM/UA's special edition offers reasonable extras but they are limited by the non-involvement of George Miller and Mel Gibson and the unavailability of any archive footage. The making of featurette and audio commentary from crew members are the best of the bunch while the Gibson featurette tends to be too much of a puff piece. Despite being listed as the Australian trailer the theatrical trailer and the accompanying TV spots are all from the US release. Thankfully the original Australian soundtrack to the feature is included on this disc. ",3.0

" 'Mad Max' is one of those films that is on everyone's top film lists. Not only did it introduce us to Australian cinema but also a young 21-year old newbie named Mel Gibson. 'Mad Max' was dark it was brooding it was destructive and it never gave us that glimmer of hope for humanity but now - nearly 20 years later - does it still remain the classic that it started? Sure it was impressive to watch the crash scenes it was powerful to see the world through Mr. Miller's disturbed eyes but is it re-watchable? Does it have the appeal to see new things throughout if watched and watched again? For me the answer seemed to float near 'no'. While I loved what 'Mad Max' represented what it was - a full body of color and action - it wasn't something to be watched again and again. Gibson does a great job as Max a man torn between the evils of the road and his personal philosophies. He begins as an ominous optimist able to stop crime as it occurs on the streets but then as his sense of normality is turned upside down his ability to react and adapt is seen. The final moments he has transformed from the man we were first introduced to into something quite terrifying. One could also compliment Mr. Miller's directorial outing at times it felt a bit episodic with tough edits placed but for the majority he told a deathly story with great ease and excitement. So again there is no arguing that 'Mad Max' is an important film one that I am glad to have finally seen but once was enough. It seems to be lacking that re-watch excitement.But why has that conclusion been made? What makes 'Mad Max' mediocre instead of powerful? It is hard to pinpoint the exact scene but the sense of 'alright I've seen it - now what' was definitely present by the end. Yet there were points that I just loved. Gibson was perfect. He was incredible as Max and the world that Mr. Miller created was intense. The opening scene the car crashes as our bearded villain just yelled 'Toecutter' was fantastic. 'Mad Max' has one of those openings that just pulls you in that makes you excited to watch a film of this intensity but then where do you go? Miller seemed to indicate that more car crashes more violence more cliche family drama would indicate a stronger film. At times he was right his ability to create different scenes set across the same backdrop demonstrated his originality but then there were times where it just felt recycled. One scene that stands out is where our gang of bikers track down a couple that happens to be at the wrong place at the wrong time they chase them down and demoralize them as Max and his partner find them - then almost repetitively it happens with Max and his girl later in the film. In this post-apocalyptic world there seems to be no problem finding someone. Space seems to not be a problem. This was another unexplained moment - where the coincidence of discovering Max or finding the biker gang should have been more difficult. These repetitive essentially simplistic scenes seemed to detract from the power of what Max represented. One also needs to ask about the story the unknown of what time or place we are following Max - would this have strengthened the story knowing what world we lived in? The understanding that this was a low-budget film was rooted in my mind the techniques provided were impressive but should that have been neglected for mediocre storytelling? Perhaps I misread this film perhaps I missed the joy of why this is hailed as such a cult success.Another weakness against 'Mad Max' has to be the relationship between his wife/girlfriend and child. Again the lacking story helped confuse this viewer as to what dynamic they had but when we have scenes in which the child is completely forgotten about - it just decimates the reasons behind Max's anger and utter breakdown. There were several scenes in which I yelled at the screen 'What about the child' then finally they would remember - he seemed to fade in and out of existence too often for one film. Then when disaster strikes we are forced to believe that suddenly Gibson would release his inner rage? It just didn't work. The same can be said for his wife/girlfriend. A stronger definition of character and even more lines spoken would have helped me see the relationship. She seemed angry at first the product of a failed marriage forced by this post-apocalyptic world to stay together then we were introduced to love then suddenly she moved to idiocrity. Who would believe that running down a road when there are open fields around is the better option? It was these small inconsistencies that forced 'Mad Max' from greatness to just another average action film. Two-plus hour sweeping epics aren't always needed but stronger characters do help in creating the world that we as viewers are to inhabit for 90-ish minutes.Finally applause are in order for the villain in this film. The portrayal of Toecutter by Hugh Keays-Byrne was outstanding. The small attention to detail as well as his ability to make you feel like he would do anything to get his way - similar to the portrayal of Joker in 'The Dark Knight' - was an up moment for this film. Like a roller coaster 'Mad Max' had these ups and downs curves and jerks and when it was all said and done you really had to question whether you were going to ride it again. 'Mad Max' is an important film there is no question in my mind about that. The door that this film opened for future cinema in America couldn't have been done by a better group of filmmakers but it isn't a promising classic. I could not watch this film again. The sequels I am ready for but this ride is over - and the park is closing. I realize that I am in the minority but 'Mad Max' is a low-budget film that uses repetitive filmmaking as its staple - originality is present but you must search to find it.Grade",3.0

" Often cited as the one that started it all (Which could be reference towards the sequels Gibson's successful career or the numerous rip-offs) this low-budget actioner stars Mel Gibson as a cop pushed to the edge. With its dark tone and brutal violence this is probably the first movie of its kind to de-glamorize car chases. Several such sequences are thrilling (Particularly the opening car chase one of the better ones in film history) but well-crafted as it often is the pace is snail-like and the dialogue and scene transitions are sometimes rather silly. Still a decent set-up for the superior sequels though. ",3.0

" This is an interesting film which if occasionally a bit wooden virtually created its own genre overnight and made Mel Gibson a star.Perhaps its most noteable feature was George Miller's use of unusual camera angles which created one or two iconic images. Sometimes it has the feeling of an exploitation film but it never develops in that way and by today's standards it seems rather tame.It looks as though it was made on a pretty low budget and I prefer the brasher sequels where a little more polish was added. It remains a film curiosity but really not much more than that. ",3.0

" I find this type of history to be dubious. The author looks at one province and then generalizes his findings over the entire South Vietnamese nation. If one were to look at the attitudes of American colonists during the Revolutionary war by region one would find great disparities of opinion and support for the independence cause. Some areas of the colonies were strongly loyalist. Did this make the independence movement less valid? Another example; take two cities in Texas Austin and Fort Worth. Survey the populations of these areas about their opinions of President Bush. You would find greatly divergent aggregate views. My point is that this type of regional analysis is of limited use if you are trying to generalize over a population larger than the one investigated.It was no different in Vietnam. There were areas where the locals strongly supported the insurgency such as in the Iron Triangle which included Hau Nghia I believe. It is no surprise that the author found support for the insurgency here. On the other hand there were many places were the population strongly opposed the insurgency and even fled their arrival. Finally let us not forget that during the Tet offensive there was no general uprising against the South Vietnamese government as the communists fully expected there would be. Quite to the contrary in fact. The ARVN fought valiantly and the general population tried to stay out of the way and let the military restore order. Much as the general population does in all conflicts.This sort of parochial view of situations can have devastating effects on Policy just as it did with the over throw of Ngo Dinh Diem. The Saigon elites wanted Diem gone. But the Saigon elites had no more in common with the populace at large in Vietnam as Wall Street Financiers have with Iowa wheat farmers. Again the ideas of a small sampling were generalized over a large population and policy was formulated based on this. Another example of this concept can be found in one of the oft criticisms of Diem. Diem was often faulted for being a catholic in a predominantly Buddhist country. Calling Vietnam a Buddhist country is like calling the USA a Christian country. Probably most Americans call themselves Christian but what does this mean? It means many things and encompasses many ideas. Ideas that are often at odds with each other. The same was true in Vietnam at the time. This kind of historic generalization is of limited usefulness to understanding the larger context. The Author should have refrained from extending his conclusions to the larger whole based on an otherwise interesting investigation.As for those who served in Vietnam and had their opinions validated by this text. Again this is a question of generalizing over the whole one's own personal experiences. We all like to think of ourselves as representative of everyone else but this is not necessarily true either. I have the utmost respect for those who served in Vietnam. They did their duty during a difficult period in our history. However most American service personnel did not speak the language were isolated from the local population and only received a limited understanding of the situation in Vietnam. How can one truly fromulate a concrete understanding of something in such circumstances? Also is the perspective of the grunt humping the boonies going to be the same as a Saigon warrior? Clearly not. Many soldiers came away from Vietnam with opinions about the local population that were shaped by an extremely limited exposure to them in a myriad of different contexts. One does not have to look far however to find countless books by soldiers and civilians who worked closely with the Vietnamese and local populations and came to completely different conclusions. Most of the books written by those who understood the language or dealt with the Vietnamese regularly show a strong belief in the cause of aiding the Vietnamese. Those who got to truly know the Vietnamese most frequently came away with a very positive feeling toward them believed they were worthy of the efforts being expended by the USA and were sincere in their desire to be free of communist domination.It has been my intention here to point out the limitations of interpreting broad historical events by looking at microcosms in history. Having established this I do believe that this book is a worthwhile read. It is an interesting regional investigation of a complex environment. I would just admonish people to approach it with an appreciation of its limitations and seek other sources to contrast this book with for a broader understanding of the war in general. ",3.0
" HP has made a solid printer for light home use in the 825c.HP based this bargain printer on the bones of the sturdy albeit older 800 series. This is a real advantage because you take advantage of HP's paid-for tooling on a formerly higher-priced series. You get a printer that's more solidly built than comparable entry-level printers but the tradeoff is that you don't get the latest printing technology advances. This printer is best for printing text and light graphics. It prints photos as well although probably not as well as a printer with the latest technologies.The 825c is easy to install -- I had it running in minutes on my decrepit 1997-vintage Windows 98 PC.

" Streisand's lastest CD *Guilty Pleasures* was a feast of songs she had never sung before and a reunion with Barry Gibb who writes for Barbra in a more contemporary way than the Bergmans or Marvin Hamlisch. It is a great CD and her voice is sublime aided of course by sound technicians. All artists owe their sound engineers their careers though. She and Barry have fun on it--it's fresh and alive. Not so much with the 2006 Concert CD a recording of the concert tour replete with IL Divo a mostly unnecessary addition. They are wooden men with BIG BORING voices.From the beginning Babs sounds tired hoarse and raspy. I saw her in concert where she sometimes sounded even worse than this recording. The engineers cleaned it up as well as they could leaving more than a hint of breathiness and weariness. Fortunately only about half of the songs are weakly rendered; the other half really are terrific experiences. I have no idea what is going on with her voice that from song to song there could be such differences but if I were Streisand I would leave the belting behind. It wouldn't hurt for her to warm up before she comes onstage not as she is giving the concert. For any price a fan would expect the performer to be well prepared. When she sings a soft ballad she often soars and her magic is prominent. It's painful to watch her crumble under the memory of her once youthful voice (and it was only a few years ago that she sounded like a 25 year old songstress). Streisand knows how to play a song for all its worth but she sometimes tramples it to death. *Don't Rain in My Parade* is just not what it used to be. She hits high notes but without the characteristic force. And she can hold the notes or seem to when she takes little breaks before each song's finale. Her phrasing is impeccable when she is giving it all she has to give but too often she seems bored. This is not a bad CD just not as inspired as *The Concert.*It also has to be said that it seems apparent Streisand is not taking care of her God-given voice one she herself has said that she takes for granted (unimaginable!!).The chatter inbetween songs is dull and preachy and it was exactly the same in every city except for blabbering about the fattening food she ate all across the US (excluded from the CD thank the Lord). The fans are really the stars on this CD--they roar constantly as if they had been starving to see Streisand all their lives. It's an odd treat. The orchestra is incredible but live it drowns her out at times (as does IL Divo). This recording does not relfect that though.If you do not own *The Concert* CD buy it and skip this one. This CD is for avid adoration-is-blind Streisand fans only and those keeping track of Streisand's vocal history.. ",3.0
" Big fan here always have been. Saw her in 1994 and 2000 and loved her voice and her song selection. Saw her in 2006 and left disappointed. I am not going to address the voice - let's face it - anyone expecting to hear Streisand in her prime is going to be disappointed. I want to address her song selection. How BORING! Like Garland's Over The Rainbow attendees cannot expect her not to sing the BIG ONES - Evergreen The Way We Were People and Happy Days Are Here Again - those are a given. But what about the rest?? Except for a few treasures (Cockeyed Optimist Unusual Way) the rest is a snooze fest. We already have live versions of Come Rain Or Come Shine (Australian Tour bonus CD from Barnes & Noble) Starting Here Starting Now Down With Love Children Will Listen What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life Somewhere. Where are the songs we haven't heard live before?? Perhaps something from Guilty Pleasures or Guilty? Anything from Yentl besides A Piece of Sky? If I Loved You? Perhaps songs she hasn't sung before from Broadway? Another Winter In A Summer Town or Will You from Grey Gardens? ANYTHING that wasn't written during the Ice Age would've sent the crowd and listener crazy. This is just more of the same just not sung quite as well as in the past. ",3.0
" I saw Streisand in concert this past October at Madison Square Garden in NYC. I have been a Streisand fan for many years and was hugely excited to actually be able to hear and see her sing live. By that point the reviews of her tour were glowing and I was looking so forward this very rare experience. I have to admit when I saw the show I felt a mixture of emotion but the most prominent was the feeling of being underwhelmed. Her voice was raspy and croaky and felt heavy in it's attempts to soar. I think her phrasing and breathe control is outstanding but the hoarseness makes this vocal instrument now far from pure. I hoped that this was simply a one night thing - she was having an off-night so much singing perhaps had strained her voice .However this record goes to show that Streisand's once incredible range power and vocal gymnastics are now on their way out. Of course she sounds good for 65 but this record in my mind should have never been released. It's hard to listen and not be disapointed. It's time that she put aside her arrogance and worked on her voice - she needs singing lessons she needs to change her diet she needs to have the voice that people want to hear not the lazy take it as you find it version. Barbra - call Celine she will give you tips on preservation! ",3.0

" For those who attended the concerts and were waiting to have a CD copy to 'feel the sense of being at her concert again' the CD is disappointed.This kind of live album is supposed to bring back the concert as it was with the highs and the lows. Even though Barbra was still great at the concert you could feel how her voice range has changed with age. (I am a lifelong fan of her musical career but not a worshiper) This album was so edited that it looks more like a enhance-in-studio product with a lot of cuts (sometimes they even abruptly cut her words...) than a concert. The sense of listening to a concert album is lost.This could be more appropiately named 'Highlights from the 2006 Tour concerts' since the production team seems like have picked the best performance of each song among the 16 dates and glue them in together.The decision to add different 'bonus' tracks for different outlets shows some lack of respect to her fans.

" It's like Miss Kittin didn't know what to do with her debut solo album so she did it all. As a result it's a distracting and ultimately uninspired release. There's a rap track (Requiem For A Hit) and a Frecnh lounge number (3eme Sexe) and a rockin' punk ditty (Meet Sue Be She) and a drony dub bit (Dub About Me) and bunch of other forgettable tracks.

" When I heard Miss Kittin was going to be launching her solo album without the production help of the Hacker or Golden Boy (with whom she's released one album each plus a few singles) I was skeptical to say the least. Considering the last time I heard a DJ set by her she spent a lot of the time vocalizing like a bad haunted house effects box or ghost cat I had little faith in how she would pull it together for a full length.The album is scattered with varied results. Some tracks are electroclash rockers like 'Meet Sue Be She' and 'Professional Distortion' although the lyrics are so awful that it really detracts from what is otherwise pretty decent music. It is refreshing that she isn't completely relying on her 'I'm bored I'm bored' schtick that brought her attention originally with tracks on which she sings quite well as well as more aggressive vocals (a la T.Raumschmiere's 'The Game Is Not Over').All this considered I suppose it's no great surprise that the best songs are produced by the Hacker and Smash TV. 'Soundtrack of Now' is light on the vocals and heavy on the stiff 4 to the floor sound that characterized the duo's album on Gigolo. 'Dub About Me' is a dub reworking of Smash TV's 'What About Me' (from their outstanding 2002 album 'Electrified' on BPitch Control) with floating vocals by Miss Kittin as well as the original vocoded vocals from Smash TV.While the album is a bit uneven honestly it's better than I had expected. Miss Kittin is more of an artist than her image tends to let on and she has proven capable of assembling a reasonable set of tracks. The genre-hopping doesn't always work but it's never dull. ",3.0
" ok so i finally got this cd the other day i've been waiting to buy it for months. well it's not so great. i mean it's not bad just nothing as jaw-dropping good as any of her collabos. the first single 'professional distortion' sounds like it was written to be a single but its pretty ok. it sounds a little matmos/aphex twin-ish the lyrics are a little silly (the lyrics only get worse the further the album goes making you almost wish that miss kittin would just sing/speak her vocals in french check out the 'rocker' meet sue be she the lyrics are cringe-inducingly bad.)another song (beat for a hit) could be good with the strange pairing of the kittin and some m.c. kind of going for a bit of slowed down ghetto tech. the song gets longish and very repetitive though. yea... the only song on the album that the hacker does the music for (soundtrack of now) is also almost all instrumental which is sad cuz its the best music on the album. so i'm sad because i really wish she would've just done another album with the hacker. he really seemed to know how to utilize her talents. this album is meandering and at times just kinda boring. it gets 3 stars cuz its still better than most crap that gets put out.

" 1.Professional Distortion - This is a great song it's wicked and would fit perfectly into the cd players of the guys with massive speakers in their cars. It's loud funky and the beat is one of the best i've ever heard. Cooly funny lyrics too. THey don't make sense. Gets boring quickly. 9/102.Requiem for a Hit - This song is sooo good! At first i hated it but it really grew on me with its incredibly simple beat and that synth that just pumps all the way through. It gets even better when Miss Kittin starts singing too. 7.5/103.Meet Sue Be She - Kind of annoying an obvious filler track. Miss kittin's voice makes me laugh again and the lyrics are woeful. But its a good song to jump around to. Pretty catchy though. 7/104.Happy Violentine - A bit of a long track but well worth the time for the experience. When i first heard it i was taken aback by Miss Kittin's songwriting talent almost flabbergasted. It gets even better when all the synths pianos and singing all manage to wind together nicely in the end. 9/105.Allergic - This song is cute and fun it's quite wierd it's very quiet and trance-like but still has a fast beat. It's unusual to the ears but its still an above average listen. 8/106.Kiss Factory - Easily the worst track on the album another filler. It doesnt make sense and its very annoying and generic. I guess one could call it catchy but i could never stand it even with 5+ listens. Turn it off please. 4/107.Clone Me - The best track on the album. It's got an awesome synth paced throughout the entire song like Requiem for a hit and is very danceable. Catchy beat and tune i love it. The lyrics like the lyrics in most of the album are nonsensical but you forget about them quickly. Great chorus - 'Hello Kittin you came to play Hello Kittin you look strange today...' 9.5/108.I Come.com - Lyrics are utter nonsense. The whispering at the beginning is kind of annoying but once the rhythmic singing comes in halfway through it gets very very good. And the way she distorts her voice is great too. 8.5/109.Soundtrack of Now - The only song on the album featuring The Hacker and thank god. This song is so annoying and is incredibly uncreative. It's a bit of a joke on this album and its about time Kittin dropped The Hacker once and for all. Worse song on the album. 2.5/1010.Neukolin - This is really just an experiment in music. It makes no sense and the only lyrics are a few words in german. It's very synthy and not pleasant to listen to. It's an experience. 6.5/1011.Dub About Me - Another slow long song but not as good as Happy Violentine. It's still very good and makes you think. It could do without the heavy jarring synth that comes through every now and then. 7.5/1012.3eme Sexe - BEST SONG EVER! This song sums up the album perfectly. It's a beautiful french ballad with a hint of electronica. If there's one song you need to listen to it's this one. Beautiful chorus beautiful music. Leaves you with good impressions of the album.

Obrador is from the southern state of Tabasco an isolated southern state that Greene visits in this book. Greene's interest in the state stems from the fact that in the 1930's the region's governor spearheaded one of the most virulent anti-religious campaigns in all of Mexico. Greene was commissioned to write about how Mexicans were coping during this period of intense suppression of religious expression. My interest in the book was purely historical and sociological; I wanted to better understand the ideology that led the state to clamp down on religious institutions and how ordinary Mexicans reacted to this. In that sense the book did not quite live up to my expectations. Instead in spite of the beautiful prose (which ensures a pretty quick read) and occasional sparks of wisdom the book read like a bitter disgruntled travelogue.For starters as Greene himself concedes his Spanish was apparently not so good at the time something that obviously limited his ability to talk with ordinary Mexicans who knew no English (this is not to mention that many of the Indians in Tabasco and Chiapas did not even speak Spanish). Tabasco and Chiapas are both built up at as hearts of darkness; he announces at the beginning of the book his intention to visit these remote places but he does not even reach Tabasco until halfway through the book as the first part consists of his journey from Texas down to Mexico City. And then when he finally does reach these places the effect is rather anti-climactic as he doesn't even seem to talk to any ordinary Mexicans about the religious situation. Obviously this probably had a lot to do with people's unwillingness to talk about such a politically sensitive issue but it was still disappointing that he went to so much effort to reach such remote places only to come away with so few real insights. In Tabasco and Chiapas the only people Greene seems to befriend are odball expatriate Europeans and Americans. These were fascinating characters and the stories of how they ended up in the backwaters of southern Mexico are worthy stories on their own but I think we would be critical of any contemporary journalist who only fraternizes with expats.Perhaps the most disturbing thing though is something that Sirin alludes to in his review (but surprisingly none of the other reviewers have mentioned) namely Greene's explicit hatred for the country and its people which was quite unexpected. As I was reading it I kept reminding myself of the context since the book was written in the 1930's from an obviously colonial mindset. However by the end of the book when Greene is tired ill and ready to return home the bitterness towards Mexico becomes hard to ignore. Virtually every behavioral trait he observes in Mexicans obviously hides sinister intentions. He has something bad to say about every place his train passes through. Again I realize that the author was fatigued from his travels and ill at this point but it still didn't make for particularly fun reading.I gave the book three stars because it does have many merits. As I mentioned Greene writes beautifully (I have read and loved the 'The Comedians' and plan to read some of his other novels in the near future). Also the simple fact that he visited some of these remote places during this interesting period of Mexico's history makes the book intrinsically interesting. Overall however the book just wasn't quite what I expected. ",3.0
" I was thrilled to hear about this book from a friend who suggested she was going to adopt for Advent a theme of thanksgiving and praise to God especially for the negative circumstances in her life. I felt this was an answer to a prayer since I'd been hoping to find some nice Christian fiction reading. So I found the book on amazon.com and bought it right away just in time for the start of Advent. The book initially seemed very good to promote these ideas. However since I have an M.A. in Theology from a Dominican school I had to try hard to overlook her harsh misrepresentation of Thomas Aquinas beginning on pg. 161. I set the book aside for a few hours and was able to return to it because I really enjoyed the earlier parts of the book. Then the author began again on pg. 173 and I just couldn't continue reading with her untruths. I had to wonder why she was so adamant about proving a wrong point and whether the other parts of her book were as unfounded as this.To expound - To classify Thomas Aquinas with the likes of Kant Calvin Rousseau - is utterly ridiculous to anyone who has any familiarity with the discipline of philosophy. If her statement is that they are philosophers and think (use their minds) and hence brought on the Age of Reason well this is superficially true. Does she regret the Age of Reason?If her statement is that reason when used to the exclusion of emotions is unbalanced her statement is true. However she is unaware of Aquinas's lengthy treatment of the emotions and their itegration in what he calls the 'intellect.' His definition of the intellect differs substantially from what we call the 'intellect' in our post-modern culture. The 'intellect' is much more expansive in his definition and does not act in exclusion to the emotions.In fact when I began to read his analysis of the emotions it was the healthiest description I'd encountered anywhere. He believes the emotions are all good all very natural. The emotions are our very personal and individual response to the environment to external stimuli and they simple are what they are. It is our response to the emotion and our consequent actions which are considered 'good' or 'bad.' We engage our intellect to decide what is good to do in each situation. The emotions themselves are completely integral to our healthy lives and cannot be judged.I am disappointed in yet another 'protestant' work which is misinformed about the very foundations of Christianity and chooses to bury an attack so deeply in its text. I was hoping for an uplifting and encouraging book to read.I will use this opportunity to suggest to ministers that the material you receive in your seminaries regarding the Catholic faith is incomplete and misinformed. Having spoken to numerous pastors about their scathing critiques of Catholicism they have admitted that their beliefs are based on their learnings at seminary. I have informed them they are factually mistaken in their teachings and to research for themselves. I will grant to author Catherine Marshall that Thomas Aquinas' seminal work 'Summa Theologica' is a very difficult read. Perhaps she relied on hearsay to form her opinions. I would encourage you to read and determine for yourself so you are not proven fallacious in your beliefs. You might enjoy it; I found it quite beautiful. ",3.0

" As the title indicates this book is about crucial confrontations. It starts off by defining what a crucial confrontation is and why we should care to have it. Then discusses how to know what crucial confrontation to hold and if one should hold it. After that comes what to do during a crucial confrontation and last but not least what to do after it. I believe that Crucial Confrontations are a crucial tool/mechanism that any successful leader should have in his arsenal. If used effectively it helps promote a culture of accountability which usually entails high performance and high engagement. This book explains in depth the process from start to finish both within a personal and work setting. The reason I gave this book a lower rating despite the very valuable content is that I felt that the material could have been more condensed and presented in a shorter more story-like format. I would recommend skimming through this book but definitely focus on the summaries of each of the chapters/stages of a confrontation. ",3.0

How does one handle an employee who is never satisfied with the work environment?

" I think if Joan Crawford had not been cast in this film it would not be given much importance because it is not that good a film but she manages to give one of her most sympathetic performances one for which she was nominated for an Academy Award although she should have recieved this honor for some of her other work like JOHNNY GUITAR or WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE?. Almost singlehandly she manages to provide the movie with many moments of unbearable suspense though the directon is not too shabby. The director David Miller uses light and shadows to provide a good tension filled atmosphere and Gloria Grahamein a performance for which she was nomintated as best supporting actress also supplies great support and she is defintley a highlight. Jack Palance is very menacing in this movie and he also manages to do a good job. The script is not that original though and ultimatly the script is the problem with the movie. And before i forget the story is about a playwright named Myra Hudson(Joan Crawford) who marries the actor she fired from her play(Jack Palance).

" NOMADS OF SOUTH PERSIA was written in the 1950s when the (nearly always male) researchers tried to conform to a perceived scientific norm. At the time Barth wrote a book for specialists not for general readers and his work has become a minor classic in the field. However anthropology has gone through many a twist and turn since then. It is doubtful if many anthropologists want to read the same book today. I recently did. I have no idea whether nomadic life continues in Iran today or if it does--- (the New York Times recently reported a 'nomad conference' that took place in Ethiopia with some Iranian participation)---if it resembles the description in this book. We might call Barth's work 'social history' now. It is a book that gives no quarter to non-specialists. If you can't use industrial-strength kinship terminology you will have a hard time following several chapters. However there are a number of interesting matters for example the nomads' animals thrive best if kept to a nomadic life. Staying all year at one place increased mortality dramatically. More centrally nomad women had a stronger role to play than those in villages because their cooperation was an economic necessity. Decision making at the lowest level of nomadic society (chiefly about moving or not moving camp) was complex and subtle due to the relative independence of everyone and complex family relations. The connection of the Basseri nomads with other nomads and with the larger sedentary society was equally interesting. The tendency of richer nomads was to invest surplus money in land; the tendency of poorer nomads to leave the nomadic life and settle down as landless labor in villages. Barth contrasts nomad and sedentary not as separate ethnic groups so much but as different life patterns extant in the same country. A vast social gulf existed between powerful village landowners and the subject landless laborers but among nomads though all were subject to the chief each household maintained considerable freedom and as long as they had enough animals economic independence.Barth concentrated on describing economic social and political organization. There is virtually nothing else in the 153 pages. You can admire this focussed approach so typical of the time or you can regret the lack of a more humanistic style which would have allowed the nomads some voice given a reader more sense of people and place examined symbol and ritual to a far greater extent or provided some clue as to Barth's own role among the Basseri. Alas self-revelation was not often thought of in that era we can hardly blame him. What startled me was the information that the author spent only three months with the Basseri. I finished the book wondering how accurate his description was and how much reflected a fine theoretical mind with an innovative cast. Barth did seem to be properly cautious about what informants said but with three months he would not have had enough time to observe actual life. Thus if the author had stayed longer with the Basseri a different book might have been written. Like Margaret Mead Barth seems to have made the most out of a short period of field work. I can only admire him for that but questions do remain. ",3.0

" I think the television listing description I read on this movie was misleading - actually no it was wrong. According to what my TiVo said the story followed a 1920s playboy who returns from a stint in the Foreign Legion to reclaim his former lover (a mobster's girl). Obviously the person who wrote this has never seen this movie. For starters he wasn't so much a playboy as he was a boxer and for second he never returns to France to reclaim his former lover. In fact we learn through the progress of the film that the woman in question has emigrated to the United States.Okay enough gripes about how inaccurate tv listings can be - what did I think about the movie in question. It's actually okay as far as Jean Claude VanDamme movies go except he really doesn't do much in the way of martial arts as he has in previous films. Instead he relies more on a rifle to shoot charging North African tribesmen or fists to straighten out fellow Foreign Legionnaire's who get their kicks out of bullying their weaker colleagues.Jean Claude plays a boxer who after reneging on a promise to throw a fight escapes into the French Foreign Legion to flee the clutches of a murderous mobster. There he is flung headfirst into the North Africa war between the local nomadic tribesmen and the occupying French forces.What was really a treat was the presence of Steven Berkoff.

Still it has good authentic location and superb supporting cast including Steven Berkoff and Nicholas Farrell.

Also it seemed prone to leaks at first (wasn't sealing properly? the rubber needed to break in I guess)... time will tell whether it is as durable as the other brands.

First there is no 'on/off' switch so if it is plugged in the warming function is on so you cannot just leave it sitting on the counter top plugged in. The second issue is that in my case water collects between the inner and outer walls of the unit (I am guessing that the 'dew collector' on the back is overflowing) requiring that I invert the unit and shake the water out.Overall it is not a bad unit but in my opinion Sanyo cut a few corners in an effort to keep the price down and it results in a less than ideal appliance ",3.0

" For some reason I always manage to botch rice the old fashioned way. Not enough water too much water too much heat. It never turns out right which is why I bought a rice maker. I also love steel cut oats which the reviews said this machine also cooked with ease. I used it a lot when I first bought it and it cooked everything very well. However I don't know if something on the machine broke or if I'm now doing something wrong but every time I try to cook my steel cut oats the lid opens up on its own and a gooey starchy mess of boil-over spills down the sides and onto my counter. When the lid opens up it also allows the water to evaporate and doesn't cook the oats properly (sometimes they're still a little crunchy). Also when there's a boil over mess it takes a lot of effort to clean all of the nooks and crannies on this machine. At first I didn't notice that there's some kind of plastic container thing on the back...and I didn't notice it until it started smelling of rotten something-or-other because dirty rice/oat water had been fermenting in it for several weeks. On cleaning the insert is really easy to wash even if you let it sit after cooking because it's nonstick. The rest of the machine including the lid and the lid gasket is a huge pain to clean if you don't wipe it down while it's still warm...and I'm notoriously bad about doing that. For this reason the rice maker has been stuck in a closet for several months now. Perhaps I'll dig it out again and give it another go because it really does a lovely job making rice...but since rice is only half the reason I bought it (oats being the other) for now it's way more of a pain to use than it's worth.

" I bought this rice cooker several months ago after researching all the options. In general I've been quite pleased with it. It makes tasty rice; the metal insert is easy to clean and the closed design prevents it from making that annoying clanking noise that occurs with cheaper rice cookers (i.e. the sound of the lid bouncing around as air escapes). For better or worse however it takes forever to actually make rice. A single 1 cup batch of rice can take 30+ minutes to cook. This means that I have started a 'quick' stir-fry on several occasions only to realize that my rice wouldn't be done for at least 10 minutes after the other food was on the table. Usually this can be circumvented by starting the rice before all the other food but I still find it somewhat inconvenient. One should also be aware of the tiny plastic drainage cup in the back of the machine. It does accumulate water from the cooking process so it should be cleaned regularly. Otherwise it gets gross. Overall I find this to be a very nice rice cooker. It does make good rice. It is not fast though so if you're looking for a quick machine this is not your best option. ",3.0
" A friend of mine spent a summer in Japan and came back with a Minidisc recorder and several compilations of crazy Japanese music. He'd lost all the artists names but one track named 'Doubt' caught my attention.Well two weeks ago I bought this on a whim because the cover looked neat. Once in my hands it looked even better but while I listened to the first track and scanned over the track list I noticed a song called 'Doubt' and then quickly associated the vocals I was hearing with the long-lost song. I quickly jumped to 'Doubt' and was treated to an alternate recording that I wasn't familiar with though it was clear that it was the same song. After a few moments of searching the internet I'm introduced to Hide. (the version I knew is usually labeled 'Doubt '97' or 'Doubt (Mixed LEMONed Jelly Mix').For a westerner Hide's solo work is pretty spotty. Three albums and a smattering of singles across the mid-90s much of it sounding like high-speed pop music with soaring solos and dripping with cheese. As far as I can tell Hide is to hair metal what hair metal is to heavy rock bands. After an evening sampling Hide's solo project it became pretty clear why his music needed to be 'altered' if he wanted any kind of success in the west. I'm not sure if jumping on the over-engineered industrial metal train was the best approach.While technically competent none of the tracks really stick with me (aside from 'Doubt' for obvious reasons). 'Fuctrack#6' is an embarrassing introduction to the tail end of the disc. By the time it comes on you'll be thirty minutes deep and you might as well stick around for what follows -- some of Hide's heavier tracks borrowed and re-recorded.Make no mistake this is Hide's attempt to bring his music to the west. Ray McVeigh and Paul Raven are here as well as a closet full of friends but nobody really takes the stage away from Hide. Don't buy this for the guest appearances list you'll be sorely disappointed -- for example Jaz Coleman shouts for less than a minute opposite some broad who wants to 'f you up the a until you bleed'. Hmm. And what exactly Geordie and Chris Vrenna contributed to all this I haven't been compelled enough to open up the booklet and figure out just yet.Unfortunately Hide passed away before this album was released. In America only a handful of fans of X Japan and whoever picked up the Heavy Metal 2000 soundtrack ever noticed. Don't let that stop you from checking it out if you're fascinated with this era or this sound but don't expect a lost gem. ",3.0
" Part of hide's charm was his free-wheeling venture into all different styles of rock music. Here the american producers of the album seem to have targeted it to a particular industrial-explicit niche losing a lot of the lightness humor and experimentation found in hide's other albums. The english lyrics to Doubt and Pose seem to be guitarist's McVeigh's setting of some standard western rock lyrics to the music and just don't sound right. The musicians are excellent and the mix great but I don't find any of the songs particularly memorable. ",3.0

OK maybe I'm being a bit harsh . . . but I did have to FORCE myself to keep reading. Eventually it stopped bothering me so much. (Or maybe he got better as he went along.)Anyway I found the Catholic apologetics most fascinating.

" A Philadelphia Catholic in King James Court was an ok book. Michael O'shea and his family move to Kentucky to live with his uncle after his father dies. Michael learns a lot more about his religion than he already knew and he also learned a little bit about his uncle's religion. Michael is forced to defend his faith to his uncle's church members and elders. This book is mainly about the arguing of Catholics and fundamentalists. Catholics believe that the bible is from tradition and fundamentalists believe that the bible is the final say in what they do. I also thought that the book was really unrealistic. What kind of teenager would spend a whole summer studying his catholic faith? I know the way that I am going to do work in the summer is if I am in summer school or I have to do work for the future school year. I also would not expect a 14 year old kid to be reciting bible passages in the middle of his sentences to back up his thoughts. I think this book should receive 3 out of 5 stars because I couldn't really get into the story at all. I guess the apologetics novel is not my type of book. ",3.0

" This novel is about a boy named Michael who clashes with Fundamentalist Christians over matters about the papacy Mary and the Eucharist while trying to understand his own faith better. I think the novel did a good job in explaining why Catholics believe what they do. I learned some things about why Catholics have the beliefs they do. One problem I found with the book was that the beginning was very dull and boring and did not draw my attention. It started to become a little more interesting with the Bible discussions but it was still boring overall. I found it hard to relate to them living on a farm. Overall I think it is a gook book to read if you want to find more about the Catholic faith but not if you want a book that you cannot put down. ",3.0

Although it explained most of the aspects of the Catholic faith in depth the presentation of these ideas was in a boring manner. It was just plain talk and no excitement. Also there we some things in the book I could not believe were true. I thought about how Michael's whole summer revolved around the Bible and work. There was no play fun or friends just dedication to the Bible. I found that hard to believe because many teens want to have fun along with having a faith. Michael just had a faith it seemed. Also I thought it was hard to believe how Michael started down in Kentucky not knowing alot about the Bible and by the end of three months he knew more than his uncle who had been studying the Bible for years.

" A Philadelphia Catholic In King James's Court was an exceptional book which consisted of Protestant and Catholic conflicts within the Bible. The quality of the book was compromised when the author's ideas and beliefs were introduced into the book. For example the author talks about how he likes the city and the country but hates the suburbs which I feel resents me and my lifestyle on page 20. The story was quite simple and a little uninteresting because the timing of the story was a little unrealistic and slow in the sense that the author tried to fit everything in during the one summer Mike was at the farm. Mike's character didn't fit any type of teenager that I know and I couldn't relate to the story through Mike in any other sense other than the Catholic sense. The story was full of religious concepts and conflicts but didn't have much relation to a teenager's problems my troubles and confusions. A Philadelphia Catholic In King James's Court was a complete story with a plot that could flare an interest in people who have encountered Apologetics in their life but did not flare my interests. I consider the story to be a good basis on Catholic beliefs and a good understanding of the conflicts between religions. This was a good book in the aspect of religion and a good book for the faithful Catholic or Protestant but not for many other types of people. ",3.0

There is some background information in the story about the Bible and its meaning. It explains passages from certain sections in the Bible and gives some understanding to the time when it was written. I also learned about Fundamentalists and their view of Biblical interpretation. If you decide to purchase this book I recommend that you pay close attention to how the Fundamentalists sometimes contradict themselves and also how Michael (the main character) approaches the scripture.

" Yo The book A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a nice book I enjoyed readin it very much. The book had a deeper meaning then what was on the surface. The story is about a boy named Mike. Mike's dad dies in a fire in the beginning of the story because of this his mom and siblings move to Kentucky with his cousins. Mike very much likes Kentucky and the farm at which they are staying at yet his uncle Les pressures him very much to become part of the Fundelmentalist church. Mike wants to stay Catholic because that is what his laid father was. The book explains mikes problems exposure opinion and experiences. The book was very insightful to a catholic who was learning about his faith like I am. This is not only a good read it would be perfect for teens or adults.

In this book Michael a teen from Philadelphia takes on his uncle's town of Bible-wielding maniacs in Kentucky.

" When I first was presented this book in class I figured it would be a corny 'love everyone' book (like the typical religion textbook). I was pleasantly surprised at its ability to keep me awake (most of the time); however it's only the first step towards apologetic novels that can be truly effective. The beginning portion is rather boring and full of unnecessary drivel. The portion in which he absorbs the Biblical knowledge later used in arguments seemed as if de Porres wrote that at the last minute for two reasons. Firstly he hardly refers to any of the information that Michael cites in his speeches despite saying in subtext that he did so. Secondly how could anyone absorb all that Biblical interpretation in such a short time let alone use it effectively? This stemmed out into other smaller contradictions which made it hard to read between the lines at times. Beyond that de Porres made readable what many could not",3.0
" A Philadelphia Catholic in King Jame's Court starts out a tragic turn of events. Michael and his family lose their father in a fire. His family is now going to move to they country and out of the city with his uncle and his family on their farm. The story really gets going as Michael adjusts to his new lifestyle. His uncle Les is a very religious man. Having once been a Catholic he converted to Fundamentalist because of differences in beliefs. Michael too started to question his religion. Yet he realized that Catholics had a different way of viewing the bible mass and Traditions. Michael spoke at Les's church in discussions explaining and proving Catholicism to the Fundamentalists. In this book you will see many controdictions and inconsistencies in Les's religion.This book is great for finding out for what you believe and what your religion means to you. It points out many problematic areas of the church and clears them out. Martin De Porres Kennedy wrote this book well and I think that it does its job; in explaining Catholicism. I never thought this book would be one that I'd enjoy but it turned out to be a very good read and an informational book. ",3.0
" A Philadelphia in King James Court is a good book to read to learn more about the catholic faith but if you were interested in reading a pleasure book you wouldn't be satisfied. Personally I didn't like the book it was a very well written and formatted book but it was also very boring. I like books with suspense and this was more of a strait forward book explaining the differences between the Catholic Church and the fundamentalist. The Catholic being Michael and his father who had died and the Fundamentalist being Les Michaels Uncle. Michael O'Shea is a 17 year old boy who is living a normal life when unexpectedly his father died in a fire. Michael had to move down south with his Uncle where he learns about their religions and about his own religion also. This is where we learn about the way of a fundamentalist compared to our Catholic religion. Even though I did not like the book I learned a lot about it in Mr. Puntel's class the book itself was very boring but when you take it into a classroom or a study you can learn a lot about your faith and about the faith of the people around you.

" This book is good and bad in some parts. It makes sense what Michael is explaining but if you think about it it doesn't make any sense. Michael moved from Philadelphia to Georgia/Alabama/SOUTH because his dad died in a heroic effort to save someone. First of all why would he leave there and second why would he go to the south instead of with relatives or back to their house in Philly. The arguments Michael presents make sense and he destroys what the fundamentalists say so much that they throw him out of the south. How does Michael learn all of this does it pop in to his head one morning and he decides to start bashing on the people he is living with and go against his mothers brothers religion. If I was his mom I would slap him and leave the south because there is no reason for him to go against it. Michael meets Les who is the leader of the local church and he has a sermon about go-between people. He says they are wrong and then when the sermon is over he decides to question the person who he is living with on his morals and religion. Les cannot explain the final answer to his sermon because he doesn't know the answer to it. The same thing happens when they go to mass at a catholic church down south. The pastor gives a sermon and Michael has no clue what he is talking about so he asks the pastor what he meant and he failed to answer him also. Then Michael realizes somehow that the fundamentalists are wrong about everything so he starts arguing with local fundamentalist leaders. In the end Michael is kicked out of the south for arguing with the head fundamentalist guy and I guess he goes back to live inPhilly with his friends. This book is good on the issues but there are key things missing to the plot. ",3.0

" This book was interesting. It was interesting to see how Michael defended his own Catholic faith against the fundamentalists. I have to be honest and say that if this book had been an optional reading assignment I would have opted not to. On the other hand I am glad in a way that it was not optional because at the end of the story I had learned some things and been given some new ideas that I had not had before. I read this book with more of an understanding of the protestant side being a Presbyterian (even though I have become familiar with the Catholic practice in Mr. Puntel's class at LaSalle College High School). Some of the things mentioned by Michael in this story were foreign at first but through class discussions I was able to get a better understand and learn some new things about the Catholic Faith that I had not yet picked up in my textbook. I would say that if you are looking for a thriller to read that this is not exactly the type of book you want to read but if you are looking to learn something new about both Catholic and Protestant Christianity this book would be an excellent start.

This book was about a young teenager named Michael who moved to Kentucky to live with his uncle for the summer. While there he learned many things. He learned that he didn't know everything about his own religion and he also studied a totally different religion. I felt that this book taught me many things. The book taught me about the beliefs of Fundamentalists. The book even taught me things I didn't know about my own religion. A Philadelphia Catholic depicts the differences between the two religions. The Fundamentalists believe that the Bible must be taken word for word; while the Catholics believe in the Bible they also base some of their religion on traditions. This book also had a couple flaws. I felt that the book was unrealistic. A teenager wouldn't spend his/her summer reading and studying about their religion as well as another religion. Another flaw was that even if a teenager studied about these religions he wouldn't become an expert so quickly. I found that rather than enjoying the book I learned from the book..

" 'The Sinful Dwarf' is a Danish/American production which actually played in theaters in Denmark (I've talked people to who saw the 'shocking' premiere). The lead actor Torben Bille is one the most recognized dwarf actors in Denmark...I guess he would rather forget this ultra bizarre piece of sexploitation.Torben lures innocent young girls to his mom's house with help of mechanical toy poodles. They are drugged and tied up and later abused by 'clients' and/or sold into slavery. In between Dwarf and his drunk mom are doin' several musical numbers. The many sex scenes are pretty close to porn and the soundtrack reminded me of the Residents. It's like an insane mix between 'Bloodsucking Freaks' and 'Pink Flamingos' with zero comic relief - this movie will blow your mind.

" From grindhouse and sleaze-meister Harry Novak and out of the deepest recesses of the 70's came - 'Dvrgen' ('The Sinful Dwarf') AKA 'Das Haus der verlorenen Madchen' 1973 and directed by Vidal Raski. Three minutes into the film we knew this was going to be one sick ride! 'Olaf' (Torben Bille) had a penchant for young innocent girls (who were also naive enough to fall for the charms of a devilish looking dwarf with wind up toys!) as he lured them to follow him home to become unwitting sex slaves! Oh and his pleasant mother 'Lila' (Clara Keller) actually encouraged this behaviour since it brought in additional income. When a young unsuspecting couple 'Mary' and 'Peter' (Anne Sparrow and Tony Eades) suddenly showed up looking for a room to let Olaf obligingly agreed (when a dwarf jumps on the bed in the room you're looking to rent and says in a Danish accent..'you see...it is a nice soft bed' and lets off a sinister cackle. Maybe it's not a good idea and politely you would say thanks but no thanks!!) and took them upstairs. Did I mention that mother 'Lila' (not to be confused with 'Lola') appeared to be a washed-up cabaret performer (she definitely did not play the 'Blue Angel') and had an inclination to dress up and sing after her drinking sessions! This flick is pretty sick and sleazy but believe it or not it's done in such a campy and looney way that you will actually find yourself laughing along with cuddly Olaf and his dear mother!!! I won't give anymore away. This is the triple xxx version (the film elements do not match but they do not appear to be inserts) so there was more than just poor naked gals! The actress that played Mary (Anne Sparrow) was actually pretty good and she definitely had a lovely figure! But its really 'Olaf' and 'Lila' that stole the show here we even got a quick glimpse at 'Lila's' disfigured body (just kidding actually the old dame was in pretty good shape. I would have wanted to see more of her with singing of course!!) she did have a scar along her left cheek (on her face do pay attention)! This was an American-Danish co-production and as I've written so many times before only in the 70's could they have gotten away with a barbaric and sadistic piece of work like this one ( but of course plenty of enthusiasts like myself already knew that) it's pretty bad. The reason I'm only giving it 3 stars the pacing was slow and unfortunately the production-values here were very low ($10000.00 more from uncle Harry could have raised the bar!) not the best lighting or camera work.

" I cannot improve upon almost all the reviews given here....but I do have a bit to say....This book is fine for mothers who are upper middle classed in two parent relationships preferably PROFESSIONALS....divorced/never married mothers simply do not have this option unless they start their own businesses and make them quickly garner profit where they can hire people to do most of the leg-work for them.And married mothers who are 'working class' or poor might not be able to follow this plan either...not unless they are willing to take government food stamps or other forms of government help.The Australian gentleman makes some especially valid points about men and 'having it all' that I was going to make had he not said them but there is even a fair way around that.I know many other professional couples where the husband and wife BOTH work part-time....their salaries are still high enough to keep them solidly middle-class yet they have more time to be parents. Note that in THIS economy this works best with friends who are in the various medical fields (physicians nurses OT/PTs speech theraphists)...these people often have openings for PART TIME professionals.In any case I believe in dealing with 'what is' rather than just what 'should be'...and the truth is that not all women work for vacations.

" I watched this movie yesterday on a lovely Saturday afternoon. Maybe i should have went to the beach because all this movie did was make me restless. Yes indeed it was a quality movie with great acting by Ian Mckellen and Lynn Redgrave. The thing that ruined it for me was Brenden Fraser. I believe he was miscast. It seems as though they gave him the part because he looks so much like Frankenstein. He should have played Frankenstein and someone like Pauly Shore could have played 'Boon'. (just kidding of course!)The overall look of the film was beautiful. It had alot of style. Another problem I had with Gods and Monsters though were the doldrum periods of the plot where Whale and Boon would sit around and psycho-babble with each other and try and pick each others brains apart. They did this too many times in the film and the reluctancy of Boon was a real turn off. Brenden Fraser does play a GREAT homophobe! I also found it repulsive that Whale allowed Boon back into his life even after Boon degrated him and did nothing short of spitting in his face. Whale should have just kicked him to the curb!The part I don't understand is why Whale had such a fascination with Boon. Why did he do so much for this guy? Boon came off as such a jerk a no brains kind of guy an opportunist. Was Boon just a piece of you know what to Whale? If so that is really sad that he chose to cherish and embrace someone like Boon. That's what I didn't like about this film! The weak characters! ",3.0
" A promising movie that never finally delivers. The acting is very good most of the time. The use of a few moviestar look-alikes was fun. Brendan Fraser was ok. He could have had more depth and more presence. Ian McKellen was terrific. His devilish weak-lipped wry smile carried the film as it does in his other films. The Frankenstein myth was interpolated into a grander metaphor to some extent but not to complete satisfaction. I pretty much 'got it' by the middle of the movie and was expecting the movie to traverse some higher plateau on the back of the conflict and metaphor but it never really got there and the second half didn't add a whole lot of sparkle. I was disappointed. It didn't live up to being what I had been expecting from all the glowing reviews. Like the monster it had all the parts but there wasn't any transforming thunderclaps no touch of the gods. The ending was rather simple not at all profound and the last scene was a bit contrived even silly in an amateur film-school kind of way. I suspect others are taken with this film more by the nostalgia it conjures than by the dramatic resolution of its storyline. It's just not the great film of its reputation. It's worth watching but there are many films worth watching and many others I'd much more recommend for your time. This one you could easily go without unless maybe you're a real Frankenstein or gay buff but even then it's not sufficiently strong on either of those themes. It had great potential. It was 'close but no cigar'--or maybe that should have been Mr. Whale's line.My review update",3.0

" I hadn't read this one of Heinlein's in many many years when I picked it up and was leafing through it in search of an answer to a trivia question. Doing this with any Heinlein novel is dangerous; in short order I was snagged into re-reading the entirety of this one. Heinlein has often been cited by many of today's scientists and engineers as their inspiration for getting into the sciences and this book is a prime example of why. As the story of Matt Dodson young man in training to be a Space Patrol officer it is a very typical adolescent-to-man portrayal. The first half of the book deals with his training from the rigorous testing to eliminate those who don't have what it takes to descriptions of the myriad of subjects an officer is expected to know. The second half details his experiences and on-the-job training as a school graduate from long boring hours in space transit to the finding of a missing Patrol ship to his experiences in the art of negotiation with Venusian natives. At no point does this book ever become boring; I fully believe Heinlein could have written a twenty page exposition on watching grass grow and kept his readers totally engrossed. Some of the details he presents on the art of astrogation and space flight may go over the heads of some younger readers of this book but it is precisely such details that will get those readers interested in studying such subjects.This book was written in 1948 and some allowances must be made for that reason such as the description of Venus as mainly a hot and very wet but habitable planet (at the time he wrote this this was one of the main scientific suppositions about conditions on the this planet). At the same time it is quite incredible just how accurate he was in describing everything from rocket ship design fuels space walks space sickness space habitats eating utensils designed for space use the utility of a global peace-keeping force (such as the U.N. which was just being formed when this was written) and even predicted the use of microwaves for cooking (this prediction is hidden in a throw away one-liner comment typical for Heinlein as he quite correctly portrays the inventions of the future as mere commonplaces of their time).Some have called this a watered-down version of Starship Troopers and there is some validity to this point as there is very little of the heavy philosophy that characterized Starship Troopers here (although like all of his 'juvenile' novels there are strong threads running throughout on the importance of honesty duty personal responsibility and the proper role of government) but much of the same flavor regarding military organizations.Other than Matt himself the characterizations are somewhat one-dimensional in some cases near caricatures drawn with broad strokes. This is not necessarily bad in a book intended for young readers who have not yet reached the sophistication to see the world in many shades of gray but is a little grating for the adult readers. The depiction of Burke supposedly good enough to survive all the testing and early training for the Space Patrol but so dunderheaded as to effectively kidnap a local Venusian 'mother' and not see anything wrong with his actions is especially grating.This book was the basis for an attempt at a TV serial",3.0
" Not Heinlein's best boy's book but a good one. I hadn't read this one in many many years and it didn't hold up quite as well as the one in my memory. But at any rate in today's world a half-century after Heinlein first published this book I really appreciate how Heinlein hammered in the need to look with respect at those who are different from ourselves specifically in regard to Oz's work with the Venerians. The 360 on the 'pie with fork' lesson was great.I also like how the book's protagonist Matt isn't necessarily the sharpest pencil in the box. He works hard he tries hard he makes mistakes and he tries to do the right thing. But it's often other characters who take the stereotypical hero's spotlight. I think there's an important lesson in there that Heinlein tries to impart.As is often the case Heinlein is pretty harsh on parents especially mothers but I made a decision long ago that this is simply part of Heinlein's baggage and his many positives outweigh this negative theme.

" There aren't many operatic versions of 'Sleeping Beauty' so it was a delight to realize that the composer of 'The Pines and Fountains of Rome' had produced this charming work back in the 1920s (revised in 1933). Interest was piqued by a recent production at Spoleto (Charleston) which traveled to Lincoln Center this past summer. I didn't attend either of these productions but the reviews caught my attention and I ordered this the only recording of the work that I know of. The piece is pretty well conducted and overall well sung although the Italian diction is not as idiomatic as one would wish from this (mostly) Slovak cast. Guillermo Dominguez (Prince April) and Adriana Kohutkova (Blue Fairy/Nightengale) are standouts. It's a lovely work that certainly deserves another recording this time with plummy Italian voices that are more comfortable with Respighi's style. I have to admit that the Act III setting in the 1930s from the 'fairy tale time' of Acts I and II is something of a shock especially the appearance of an ugly American (Mr. Dollar Checques) and the 'fox trot' finale. Perhaps more sympathetic performers could have brought it off. ",3.0

" This is one of five of The Steve Miller Band's first five albums that's gotten a well deserved new mastering job. Thankfully there's no compression that makes good sounding older period music hard (or impossible) to listen to. Or any bad remixing that also destroys the original sound we all remember. The sound on this reissue is clean and fairly crisp with a bit of warmth reminiscent of the original LP mix. Is this a quantum leap in sound quality? No but it does sound good. Sound is so subjective-what one person hears as good-another hears either nothing better-or hears even worse sound.I've read that the EQ on these discs is overly bright. But I'm just wondering with new mastering using present day equipment if we're now able to hear more detail in the high end than on previous issues. That may cause some listeners to hear it as slightly brighter. Listening to the album 'Children of the Future' (with that great original LP side-long suite on 'Side One') for example I can hear much more detail on the higher end-acoustic guitars are more discernible in the background as are snippets of background vocals. But I have to say that I never thought this particular album (the original vinyl LP) sounded all that great a bit muddy sounding-even with Glyn Johns at the controls-but that may be just me. On the other hand the band's next (vinyl LP) album 'Sailor' sounded much better to my ears-again with Glyn Johns producing. As I said sound is so subjective.Since this particular album has been difficult (or impossible) to find I thought I'd choose this new edition for review along with a bit on the other four albums. The disc is snapped inside a tri-fold cardboard holder with a pocket for the 11 page booklet. The booklet has a few photographs from Miller's personal files and an essay based on a recent interview with Miller. The other new editions are similar in format.Overall this is a worthwhile album (and one of my favorites) but not the best effort by the band-now reduced to the core trio of Miller Lonnie Turner-bass/guitar/background vocals and the great Tim Davis-drums/background vocals. This is before Miller's approach changed somewhat to more pop leaning radio friendly songs and his orignal band had splintered. The core trio is augmented with the addition of either Ben Sidran or Nicky Hopkins on keyboards and Glyn Johns or Minor Wilson on guitar. Davis really shines vocally on the song 'Your Saving Grace' where his lead vocal makes you wonder why he didn't get more of a chance to sing. And check out 'Little Girl' and 'Just A Passin' Fancy In A Midnite Dream' for a bit of that old Miller Band sound. Another good song is 'Don't Let Nobody Turn You Around' but fans will have their own favorites.There's no extra tracks on this edition but the lyrics are included. But for instance the first Miller Band album does contain the song 'Sittin' In Circles' as a bonus. On first listen it doesn't seem to really fit in with the original album-the song sounds to 'poppy' and a bit lightweight but it's good to have it included. The sound on all these albums is similarly good so if you've wanted to replace your old CD copies (or couldn't find them on CD-like this particular album) this is a chance to own them with good sound and updated (but not in depth) liner notes and photos. Hopefully the price will come down some for these albums but even if that doesn't happen this is a chance to hear these albums with much more agreeable sound.I've been waiting for someone to reissue these albums with new mastering (and extra tracks-oh well) which does justice to the band's sound. I just wish that someone would release all the old period Miller Band music that's still squired away in the vaults-along with the live sets that are still hidden away-or maybe an all inclusive box set encompassing the first five albums and related studio and live tracks-maybe someday. But for now these new editions are well worth hearing. ",3.0

They whine and scream more often than not and the comic relief is painfully uncomfortable. The main character... a young new recruit... is a noise machine. If she's not screwing up she's pontificating and just won't shut up. The even bigger problem with that is she's not the loudest of the bunch.

" For those buying this Deadly China Hero dvd you are getting a [junky] version of the original film Last Hero In China. The distributors for Deadly.. are known for bootleggin movies and cutting scenes out so look for the right one if you intend to check this film out. This film is the Jet's second to the last installment to the Once Upon A Time In China (OUATIC) series. It's nothing spectacular in my opinion but it's not a bad film either. Tsui Hark who did the original OUATIC series is not a part of this film; instead the dirty Wong Jing directed this film which kind of hurt it a bit. Yuen Woo Ping still provided the choreography but I've seen better. Wong's aunt or love interest (Rosamund Kwan) is also out of this picture. Jet plays Wong Fei Hung once again and he moves his school temporarily to a new location. The school ends up next to a brothel Fei Hung soons discovers corruption and kidnappings of women taking place around the town. Officials want to get rid of him and of course Wong wants to save everybody as usual. This is probably all you'd need to know about the story because it really is not that interesting. Right from the start I could not take this film seriously at all. It was trying pretty hard to be funny and sometimes it worked other times it failed miserably. It felt like watching a parody of OUATIC. The MA were good but not great; there was simply too much wirework and fake elements involved. It's one thing if the movements look real but wirework was pretty bad in this film. There's a scene where a bad official slaps his hands on tiles and this brings them up flying at Wong; all of a sudden the official decides to literally swim or glide across the ground afterwards...couldn't help thinkin what was the point of it was but anyways. The bad official (Alan Chui?) also has one of the most annoying laughs you'll ever hear. There were bits and pieces of battles that stood out but not one ENTIRE fight scene impressed me. The Shaolin Master Killer Gordon Liu(Lau Kar Fai) was also in the film as a bad guy but director Wong Jing clearly wasted Liu's talents by not using them. In addition the outcome of his final battle is pretty pathetic. There is a fight between Liu and Jet that starts off decent until the flying elements came into play...sigh...like I said bits and pieces. Cheung Man is also in the film but her MA is strictly wire based and made her look like a ballerina...nothing impressive. As everyone already mentioned here the last battle involves Jet in a chicken suit fighting a group of baddies dressed as a centipede. It's kind of silly but the battle that follows between Fei Hung and the bad official is nice. There is still wirework done here but this battle probably had the most REAL and serious MA. Sadly there were many shots that made me realize that Jet was doubled for many of the sequences...sigh...you'll also see Jet try to use the drunken style though unconvincing and some great moves came afterwards and probably is the base of my rating. Some of the moves here are pretty brutal and they stayed in my mind even after the film. Overall I would call this an average movie. OUATIC 1-3 totally outshines this film because there was more meaning to it and I felt more for the characters plus the MA was far better. I can't really recommend you to buy this film but since it is pretty cheap why not. Besides it's part of Jet's Wong Fei Hung history. It's definitely worth checking out so you can make your own opinions. To me this film is trying too hard to be funny and sadly I found myself laughing at scenes in the film that probably weren't intended to be funny. Better Jet films are his original OUATIC 1-3 Fist of Legend (his best) Swordsman II Tai Chi Master Kung Fu Colt Master Shaolin Temple and more...hope this was helpful check out my other MA reviews thanks for reading.

" Before reading this review you should know that this film is the same movie as 'Last Hero in China.'This film is as the title of this article proclaims an interesting combination. Combination of what you ask? It is a combination of the Historic Chinese Martial Arts extravaganza and a Tom Green movie. What makes the film interesting is that the combination is not as bad as it sounds. Jet Li once agains plays the role of Wong Fei Hung as he did in the Once Upon A Time in China historical epics but this Fei Hung is a very different character from the more serious Fei Hung (particularly in the first OUATIC) we are used to.In essence this film takes the fairly standard school versus school and style versus style conflict and extends it to a Dragon dancing competition (mirrors of OUATIC here but wait) with Jet Li's masterful Dragon dancing interrupted by a villain in a Millipede suit. Jet Li loses the initial competition due to various circumstances which include the villain's nepharious influence. Jet Li recovers and battles the Millipede in a Chicken Suit in the final battle. Chicken suit? Yes a chicken suit. I told you there was a touch of Tom Green in this movie or is it Adam Sandler? Doesn't matter.Typical of the Jet Li/Wong Jing pairing films this is a less than serious affair. If you go in expecting wonderful wuxia wire-fu and a few laughs in a no budget free for all you will have a great time. Jet Li is an amazing martial artist and somehow this film works.

There are something over a dozen books in the series all told plus a few spinoffs of books about Olivia Clemens and Madeline two of Saint Germain's lovers who become vampires themselves.The series so far has been quite good; I continue to feel somewhat guilty for not rating the books higher than I do. But there is the continuing stylistic affectation of placing a piece of correspondence after every chapter which I continue to find minorly distracting and there is a scene in this book that seems to be simply out of character as it has been so far defined for the main character. We have been given to understand that many of the traditional legends of the weaknesses of vampires such as the inability to cross running water and the inability to withstand sunlight are conditionally true in the world of Saint Germain; that is to say they are true but can be overcome so long as he stands upon his 'native soil' so he has learned to wear special shoes that are hollow and filled with soil from the land of his birth. Yet in this story when deprived of his special shoes and forced to fight giant crocodiles at midday during a blisteringly hot Roman summer day in the arena (in water) while constantly commenting on how ill and unwell this makes him feel he's still able to function well enough to slay several crocs and survive. (It's not giving away critical plot points to reveal his survival considering that he exists in the previous two books of the series both of which occur historically later than this one). He doesn't as near as I can tell even get a sunburn. This is just so far out of line that I feel the need to dock the book a star just for this one scene; otherwise the book is quite well written.If you are a fan of traditional vampire fiction you may possibly find yourself disappointed with this series; there are many elements generally found in the vampire genre that are missing from these books. But if you like historical romance or even historical fiction in general and don't object to the concept of a heroic vampire protagonist you should find this book and probably most of this series quite enjoyable.

" The Village Barbershop is a nice surprise. A heartwarming mix of loneliness with humor this film takes place in old Reno. A barber who feels he has lost everything comes in contact with a young woman who has never had much of anything. She is full of spunk and determination however and eventually the barber gives in to her ideas for his dying barbershop. Hilarious scenes with the barber's college age renters next door. The unusual friendship that develops between the barber and the young woman brings each of them to better lives. The writer director and producer Chris Ford has a winner with his first movie. See it!

" ***1/2'The Village Barbershop' is a modest unassuming little indie comedy set in the unusual locale of Reno Nevada.Art Leroldi (the wonderful John Ratzenberger) is the cantankerous old-school barber whose business has fallen onto such hard times that he is at risk of losing the establishment that he and his recently deceased partner have run for many years. Against his better judgment he hires a free-spirited young woman (the endearing Shelly Cole) to serve as both his accountant and fellow haircutter at the shop. At first both Art and his conservative customers have a hard time adjusting to this frightening new-world-order of gender equality but through her expertise with the scissors and the force of her personality Gloria eventually manages to win them over to her side.Given this undeniably slight storyline it's obvious that this movie was never going to exactly set the world on fire - but within the admittedly humble parameters that he's set for himself writer/director Chris Ford has succeeded in creating a sweet and amusing regional comedy filled with sparkling performances and generous dollops of local color. Ratzenberger and Cole have charm and likeability to spare and their scenes together are played with understated warmth and humor. Their performances alone compensate for the occasional overindulgence in indie-brand quirkiness and feel-good sentimentality.A minor film but an enjoyable one. ",3.0
" I think that this book was not too bad and is worth the buy but it could be improved. Content wise it was not so bad but it was the layout and presentation (amateur photographs) with heavily packed text. It looks like a scrapbook a child would throw together - and this may not necessarily be a bad thing considering the audience is children. I was really up in the air rating this one and would have given it a 4 if the organization was a bit cleaner. It deserves a 5 if it was organized a bit better 'and' images were professional throughout - so you can see why I am saying it is worth a buy.If your child has an interest in becoming a vet this is a recommendable book along with others and let them decide if the content within is worth a visit.

" The film about a man who is haunted by the visions he sees. On the surface it appears to be a ghost story but it turns into the exact opposite of that. The movie is very real so expect to see what you would never see in an American film I.E. children dead or murdered. I liked the idea that 'The Uninvited' doesn't sugarcoat or sensor the events that occur. They show you so that you understand just why the characters are so broken when they recall certain events in their lives. By the title of the movie you would think 'The Uninvited' pertains to some sort of entity but really it pertains to a paranormal ability to see and experience things you would rather not.In the fashion of Korean horror this isn't something that you've seen before. The story isn't exactly predictable and problems just don't smooth themselves out. I thought this was a good film. I just assume that the name may confuse people with the American movie which this is NOT! an Asian version of.'The Uninvited' brings its own sense of eeriness that's not your typical haunted ghost story which it may seem like at first. I rated it 3/5 stars because although it's an interesting film it's also a pretty depressing film. The theme of the movie seems to be despair and the only relief from it seems to be death or suicide. The characters seem to have no real resolve to their problems other than to just 'deal with it'. I didn't like the idea so much that even though both of the characters had people around them that cared for them and wanted to help them they still felt so lonely and isolated in their issues.The ending also didn't exactly answer a simple question that I think most people wanted to know about the main character and his fiance. Might seem like it wouldn't be something to be too concerned about but the difference leads to answer another possible question. Like is he going to walk down the same road as the others effected by the paranormal powers.Overall a good film to watch but it's subject matter may not be for the sensitive. I wasn't exactly expecting them to show a child being ran over by a truck either but that's what makes the movie realistic. ",3.0
" I would have to agree with another review that said this movie was disappointing. Indeed much of it seemed pointless.

" I read the book and thought it would be a good series but unfilmable as a movie. I was wrong. The movie concentrates essentially on the modern 19th wife and the murder of her husband. It's not necessary to have read the book to follow the story and it is a good 'who-done-it?'. The movie does refer to the history of the wives by brief scenes that take place in Salt Lake when Brigham Young was the profit. Those scene inform the viewer as to how we came to be where we are today. It's a film-making strategy that in this case works well. Probably because those scenes aren't flashbacks.The movie adds colour to a dour book and illustrates (peoples?) the story with the multiplicity of the wives",3.0
" There's not much going on in this CD other than mindless background music. It's mostly all improv and while it's tolerable it's nothing special at all.

" The Case of the Haunted HusbandStephane Clair quits her job as a hat check girl and hitch-hikes to Los Angeles. She is picked up by a wealthy man who drinks and drives fast. There is an accident; people are injured and one dies. But Stephane is found alone in the car and charged with manslaughter. A friend obtains Perry Mason's help. The owner of this car says it was stolen and has an alibi. But did he loan this car to a friend? His insurance covers a stolen car but not one driven by him or an agent. The investigation of the owner reveals some curious facts derived from telephone bills (long distance). This leads to a Mrs. Warfield in New Orleans. A promise of a job brings her to Los Angeles (Chapter VII). This chapter gives an example of proper behavior in a job interview even one designed to investigate the applicant. Mason puts detectives to work on the witnesses. But Mrs. Warfield outsmarts Mason and Drake (Chapter X)! They find the missing driver but he won't testify in court to clear Stephane.Information is found that would clear Stephane. But the chauffeur becomes unavailable to testify like the missing driver. The police and district attorney are wary of Hollywood influence (Chapter XIX). An interview in the hotel room with the widow points to the likely suspect and confirms Mason's suspicions. Mrs. Warfield is found in hiding and the story ends. The ending seems logically flawed to me. Its as if Gardner was afraid to offend Hollywood and the powers behind them. One interesting scene is where a person leaves their hotel room and doesn't lock the door; what a sense of security in those days.The ending seems logically flawed to me.

" It was a good look at this program. It was a well done documentary and I appreciated learning some new things. How many even know about this part of the Samaritan's Purse organization? I'd never heard of it (not that I am an indicator). You can see the sacrifices and challenges that are encountered (as well as the blessings!) of the families that take these three children into their homes while the children wait to have a surgery that they could not have otherwise. The surgeries give them an extension to their lives. The youngest would not have lived for many more years if left untreated. In the process they are also given the opportunity to accept Jesus (the youngest one may not understand at the time). They can go home and share this new relationship with their families also.The documentary isn't something you will be able to `just watch' -it'll give you a case of lump in your throat if you don't just break down and cry. But at the same time there are many instances where you will smile along.This isn't something that I would normally watch and that is why I felt it was 'ok'. There isn't anything 'wrong' with it really.

" Lately my 4 year old daughter has been obsessed with computer games. I'm buying more games on CDs to decrease her exposure to the internet. She loves animals so I figured this would at least be mildly interesting. That turned out to be an understatement. She fell in love with it instantly.There are four characters in the game and each has an animal friend. To play the game you have to prepare each character and their animal for a pet parade by teaching the animal a trick picking out clothes for the character and designing a float for each pair. After each pair and their float is ready for the parade you have to organize the parade and add special effects. Then you start the parade and the program plays out the parade that you designed. The parade is actually pretty brief but it can be played over and over as many times as you like.The game can be quickly mastered by most children but has enough variety to encourage them to go back to repeat the tasks many times. There are a variety of clothing choices and float options. Even though it seems repetitious to me my daughter doesn't seem to mind it - and she's very advanced with computer use. I've also noticed that when she goes back over and over to play the games where she teaches the animals their tricks for a specific parade the game increases in difficulty so it's not monotonous. There are also several options for printables including a cute friendship bracelet with your child's name on it.This game certainly would not qualify as educational although it does build good computer skills and hand/eye coordination. Overall I would say it's just good clean fun.I gave this four stars because sometimes the program seems a little slow and there is a delay between screen changes. Also you can't play the game without the CD in the disk drive even after fully loading the game on the computer. This is a negative to me because for most kids you would have to assist them with starting the game. However my 4 year old has pretty much mastered inserting the CD closing the drive drawer and clicking on the program icon. I'm just not totally comfortable with her doing it when I'm not there. The last thing I need is to have a broken CD jammed in my computer... ",4.0

" This is all-around a pretty good lawn book. However there are a few cases where the advice is a little outdated given the latest research on the subject.One is the subject of using a mulching mower; research has shown that using a mulching mower does not contribute significantly to thatch buildup. Finely chopped grass clippings from lawn grasses decompose very rapidly. I guess you might get in trouble if you have lots of aggressive weed grasses that grow extremely rapidly leaving much larger amounts of grass clippings. It is also possible that using a non-mulching mower could get you in trouble; it sounds like Mr. Baker might be using a reel mower which doesn't pulverize the leaves. The research that I have seen studied the effects of using a mulching mower on lawn grass only so if you have loads of tall weed grasses or are using a non-mulching mower you might have trouble.Another is the subject of aeration. From what I have read spike aeration (Mr. Baker recommends the use of those spike aerator sandal things) is not very effective. Core aeration which is admittedly more difficult and expensive is what gets the best results and is actually effective at controlling thatch.Here is one of the many pages on these subjects",4.0

It was a little predicatable but there is still a quality in Christine Feehan's writing that grabs you and keeps you interested... and wishing that it had not ended!The only compliants I have is that one of the brothers characters was undeveloped to the point that it did not make sense as well as the 'special gifts' that both the main characters had. The authors seemed to imply some power beyond ESP but yet never expanded or provided any sort of explanation for these 'gifts'.I am really looking forward to the next novel.

This is the story of the village healer a beautiful girl names Nicoletta and the Fierce dark and cursed Don Giovanni Scarletti.

She also has to treat him as he is ill also. She is strangly drawn to him even though she resists.

" The Scarletti Curse is the story of a young and very innocent healer Nicoletta who is chosen to stand beside a powerful Don the Don Scarletti whom even the king feared. The story centers around the curse on the Scarletti's where the women they love end up dead and where most women who come to the Palazzo Scarletti die including Nicoletta's mother and aunt. Nicoletta (a healer) herself is chosen via bride contract by the Don Scarletti (a Telepath) and the story developed from there with many twists and turns. The characters were well developed and the story line kept you guessing until the end. I was so hooked that I finished it in one night the same night I got it through the mail.Christine has done it again. I picked up the 'Scarletti Curse' uncertain on what I would find. On one hand she has been consistent in writing books with great character development and great story lines in her 'Dark' series about the Carpathians. On the other this was a non-Carpathian book though a Gothic so I did not know whether she could make the transition. She made the transition extremely well and created another keeper for my keeper shelf.Christine has proven that she can write differently and Scarletti Curse was refreshingly interesting. I am anticipating and hoping that she will expand this into a series. (Spoiler here",4.0
" As a fan of gothic and paranormal stories this book appealed to me. True it had a lot more sex than Victoria Holt or other gothic writer favorites ever included in their books but it didn't take away from my enjoyment.Nicolette is a free spirit with a secret. She was born with the gift of healing and knowing when somebody needed her.The villagers depend on her healing skills and rally around her to keep her hid from outsiders. They know Nicolette could be burned as a witch otherwise. Don Giovanni the dark brooding aristocrat wants Nicolette the first time he sees her. Though his family lives under a curse that all of their women will die he is determined to make Nicolette his bride.I don't believe in giving too much information in a review so I won't say what happens between them. The book is very atmospheric with the castle and it's sinister wall carvings the brothers and grandfather who have all lost their wives and last but not least the hero with his own gift. One thing I liked about the hero is he was arrogant but not overly so. He had a soft gentle side that overshadowed his arrogance at least to me. I hate heros who are overly arrogant simply because they are men.This was my first book by this author and I am looking forward to reading Dark Prince another book I have by her. ",4.0
" I've really like Christine Feehan Gothic stories I have to admite that I had finish reading this book since June but haven't had the chance to write my review till now.This book is dark and mysterious which is filled with suspense and sensuality. Nicoletta is a very likable heroine with healing gift's .She embrace life with such open arms and feet ( you'll understand once you read it). Her compassionate nature and youthful innocence is quite endearing. Giovanni's character is such a mystery which makes you want to know him and his family even more. The way he treats Nicoletta with such tenderness is such a contrast from how people perceived him to be.Christine Feehan has done well in describing the atmosphere within the palazzo including the design and architecture lending to the eeriness of the story there were some parts that dragged a bit but I guess she wanted the readers to have a good visual through out the read. ",4.0
" Having read Feehan's 'Dark' series I have to say that I think this is her best book ever. THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a true gothic romance and people who love gothics--like me--will definitely want to read it.The book has elements that were in Feehan's vampire novels and which will be familiar to that audience",4.0
" I must confess that I was very leery to begin reading this book. My feelings have nothing to do with Ms. Feehan's writing style. I so love Christine's Dark series I feared that I would inevitably begin to make comparisons and would find this book a major disappointment. It wasn't.There is a terrible curse which plagues the Scarletti men. Every woman who enters the Palazzo as a bride winds up dead. What or . . . whom is causing these fatal accidents?Nicoletta is a healer who possesses 'special' gifts. Deep within her being she senses when someone needs her. She is drawn to the great Palazzo knowing that there is a young girl inside who is desperately ill. Once inside those forbidding walls she encounters Don Giovanni Scarletti known as Il Demonico (The demon).He is dark brooding and utterly dangerous. Nicoletta instinctively senses the potential threat he poses to her yet she is drawn to him as he is to her. Even the knowledge of his dark and deadly reputation cannot sever the attraction from growing.Don Scarletti also possesses his own 'gifts' and chooses her for a bride. What initially begins as a duty for Nicoletta turns into passion than into love. Will Nicoletta suffer the same fate as others have? Or will her unwavering love and ulfaltering courage finally bring an end to the family's deadly curse?You have to read the book in order to find out those answers and more. Enjoy! ",4.0

" I started this book with great expectations after reading all the dark series but found it not as compelling as them to start with. It took me a while to get into the book. The story is slow to start with but it develops into a very exciting climax. I never guessed the culprit and it was a complete surprise to me. I think I have been spoiled for anything else by the Dark Series and it will take a lot to compete with them. I would have given this book 5 stars if it hadn't been for the beginning. ",4.0

Christine Feehan did an excellent job and i'm looking forward for her next bookwell done. ",4.0
" The book was good up until the end when I found out who the killer was. I was expecting more. Towards the end of the book finding the real killer killed it for me. To me towards the end the story started loosing itself. I guess the way the ending was written letting one know who the killer is was not done properly. One is kept in suspense through out the whole story and then she just trows you who the killer is out of nowhere and in a rush. Her best work is the Dark series books. I cannot wait for DARK DESIRE.

" Though I still favor the carpathian series I really enjoyed this book. Christine Feehan still kept some of her supernatural writing which made this book stand out from others that write mystery romance. Her men are still wonderfully stubborn know what they want and get it. Her women in her stories are still head strong not whiny and give the men a challenge.

" For anyone interested in the history of the ordination of women as rabbis this book is excellent. It is written primarily from and dealing with women in the British rabbinate but is beneficial and applicable to all. It raises interesting discussions about women's involvement in Jewish leadership and even highlights the first woman rabbi in modern times - who was ordained in Germany in 1935. It would not be until the 1970's that women would be ordained in America. As an American Jew I found this book very interesting and I gained insights into the Jewish community of Britain. ",4.0

My honey color looked darker than the photo on Amazon but this desk combo is lighter than the companion toy chest by the same manufacturer in the same honey finish.

" Now to start off there are two types of heart fans.There's the early Heart fans 1976-1983and then there middle/later heart 1985-1993.I'm one of few or maybe many who thought there best album was this one.They shed that 70's sound entirely and went full throttle into the 80's melodic Rock/Metal sound.The front picture on the album says it all.They became 100% Hair/Melodic metal band.After this album though it was downhill I have to admit.In 1987Bad Animals did just as goodbut it lacked the toughness that this album has!1.If Looks Could Kill(10/10)Excellent song.Nancy is one of the best guitarists.This song rocks!2.What About Love(9/10)Their big radio hit from 85.I'm sure you've heard this one!3.Never(10/10)Holly Knight(of Spider and Device)co-wrote this song and played the keyboards on this one.A great rocker with a catchy chorus!Holly Knight has wrote some great songs!4.These Dreams(6/10)Another ballad of this album.Not Badbut I never thought it was there best ballad.5.The Wolf(8/10)Tough and fun anthem rocker.Ann's voice sounds great on this one.More fierce guitar work by Nancy!6.All Eyes(8/10)A very fun song.Holly Knight also co-wrote this one as well.This song's alive with that 80's sound!7.Nobody's Home(5/10)Another ballad.Not badbut not the best.Fans of 80's Heart will love this one most likely!8.Nothin at All(6/10)Not bad.A lot of bars across the country always have this one on the jukebox!9.What he Don't Know(7/10)More of the sameanother ballad type song!10.Shell Shock(8/10)Fast and tough rocker.Nicely done!The fans of 80's music and 80's Heart fans will love this one.This is a fine example of a time when music was good unlike today!For the price this cd is going for I say tha it's worth owning for your collection.It has some cool songs that are party favoriteswell at least my partyn favorites!

" I'm not a rock snob; I just think Ann Wilson is sexy. I always liked this album; my favorite song is 'Nothin at All.' Until I got the CD I listened to the cassette edition. I was disappointed to hear that at least two of the tracks 'Never' and my favorite had been replaced with different takes. In the case of 'Never' I don't really care since the replacement sounds essentially the same as the original. But the original track for 'Nothin at All' is definitely preferable to its replacement. First it's not as clean",4.0
" 4 out of 5 stars. This is classic '80s. These Dreams and What About Love are terrific tracks. I know their early stuff is classic and a lot of people slam this. I don't care. It fit with the time it was released and was better than most of the other stuff out there then. I love this album. This along with Dire Straits Brothers in Arms are my favorite two non metal/hairband albums from the '80s. I give them credit for re-inventing themselves and keeping relevant. ",4.0
" Well it may seem impossible but one could certainly argue the case with Heart's self-titled album. Released in the middle of a decade that made Heart's earlier material irrelevant to most mainstream audiences Heart found themselves back on the map in a huge way. Their debut 1976's Dreamboat Annie had established a band who could flaunt their ability to play hard rock and folk rock and mix things like moogs and flutes into their music. Basically everything that was wildly popular in the 70's. They also really helped show us how hard chicks could still rock.What Dreamboat Annie did for the 70's their self-titled album the 8th in their studio line did for the 80's. Teaming up with some professional songwriters and producer Ron Nevison (Europe Ozzy Osbourne KISS Survivor Jefferson Starship Chicago etc.) Ann and Nancy Wilson reinvented their look and sound for the decade and produced their best-selling album their first and only album to reach no. 1 and their first no. 1 single. The first four tracks (all of which were released as singles) give a good taste of what Heart would offer up on this album.You get your upbeat energetic chugga-chugga hard rock guitar riff in opener 'If Looks Could Kill.' Then 'What About Love' gives you a melancholy mid-tempo lyrically-heartfelt ballad but in spite of those characteristics it is filled with emotion that only Ann can deliver in song and music that helps her cause immensely. Next is 'Never' which is yet another ballad. This time however the sad sound is replaced with a more upbeat happy feel. Synths are very big in all these songs much like moogs and flutes in their early material. Arena Rock bands were big on hard rockers but at the same time always hit it real big on the charts with the ballads.The band's first no. 1 single came in the form of 'These Dreams' and given the time of this album's release it is not at all hard to see why. For one thing all the instrumental leads are synths. The drums are electric too and only the vocals and bass are not synthesized. This is perhaps the most mellow of all Heart's songs. For a long time I myself refused to even consider it a song of theirs but it became a convincing factor in my purchase of this album. This song truly shows what Nevison's synth-happy production can do for bands",4.0

" Heart's self-titled album is not Heart's first one. Their first album was 'Dreamboat Annie'. However after about 10 years these two women release one of their best albums. The opening song 'If Looks Could Kill' is really rocking and after that there's many great songs and you could almost say that this is an ultimate fem-rock album...but then the ninth track 'What He Don't Know' proves to be so basic rock. The ballads 'These Dreams' and 'Nobody Home' are great ones as well as 'What About Love' 'The Wolf' 'Shell Shock' 'All Eyes' and 'Never' which are great classic rock songs. 'Nothin' at All' has great 'echo sounds' which were later copies by The Corrs. This is a great hard rock album although not so similar to 'Dreamboat Annie'.Stars",4.0
" At the time this was originally released I worked in a retail store in a department adjoining the music section. They used to play these tracks all the time. After a while I was kind of brainwashed. It got good to me so I bought the tape.The tape always annoyed me because it was so... linear. Couldn't skip the nasty tracks for the good ones easily. This CD release helps a lot with that. On the other hand I only just bought the CD and I stopped listening to the tape 10 years ago. It took me that long to remember to buy the CD version.My favorite tracks for 'These Dreams' 'What About Love' and 'Never'. This CD is about as pure 1980s rock as anything I can think of.

" Some Heart fans like to pretend that 1985's self-titled Heart album never happened but the band's makeover as a keyboard-heavy AOR act gave their career a much needed shot in the arm as well as some much deserved attention. Between the hitmakers brought in to contribute on songwriting to the shiny 80's production job the band's self-titled album was as good an AOR album as you could hope for and featured some of the band's biggest hits.Sure the band 'sold out' and the material on Heart is much more radio friendly than their early material but we're not exactly talking Starship's 'We Built This City' here. The tracks on Heart are well-crafted pop songs that are written to take full advantage of the Wilson sisters' considerable talents. I was blown away by the glorious dramatic 'What About Love' and 'These Dreams' and the infectious 'Never' and 'Nothin' At All' two decades ago (God has it really been that long?) and am just as impressed today.I can see how old-school Heart fans could have a problem with this album but this is the Heart I grew up with so I'll always consider it a classic album.

" In 1985 the veteran 70's hard rock band Heart released their first album on Capital Records. Titled simply Heart the album represented a new direction for the band fronted by sisters Ann and Nancy Wilson. In the late 70's Heart had found a very successful commercial niche with their blend of Led Zepplin influenced hard rock combined with some folk influenced acoustic ballads. But the early 80's proved to be a rough time for the band as their style of music fell out of commercial favor and the group was rocked with line up changes that saw them first reduced from 6 members to 5 members with the departure of original lead guitarist Roger Fisher then the replacement of the bands rhythm section. By 1984 their previous label had released the band from its contract.Fortunately they were picked up by Capital. But the band its management and its label all knew that if they were to get back in the game they would have to make changes. Heart abandoned their Led Zep meets Joni Mitchell sound in which the Wilson sisters took charge of writing most of the material. Instead the band produced more radio friendly pop rock material with many of the songs written or co-written by professional songsmiths such as Billy Steinberg/Tom Kelly Bernie Taupin and Diane Warren. In addition to promote the new material the band glammed up their appearance for music videos and the directors made prominent use of the Wilson Sister's cleavage especially Nancy Wilson's as lead singer Ann battled with her weight during this era. These changes would prove controversial with many of the band's original fanbase and this created a split that exists to this day with some fans only preferring the 70's material while others like all their material. However the gambit worked and won the band a whole new generation of fans many of whom were not familiar with the band's previous musical incarnation and thus forming a third fanbase.Despite the change in direction certain elements remained the same",4.0

" While I do believe Heart's self-titled 9th album was a monumental success for the band I don't believe it should be considered the 'Comeback album'. The band had hit some hard times with it's two previous releases but those albums were so misunderstood by the public at their time of release. Both 'Private Audition' and 'Passionworks' now should and are revered by the die-hard fans like myself for their boldness and pardon the pun heart. Heart the album is very well produced and written my only problem with it is that most of the material was not written by the stellar writing team of Ann Wilson Nancy Wilson and Sue Ennis. This album although not a strong creative effort by Heart is still has an awesome sound and should be a staple in even the casual Heart fan's music library. So what are you waiting for BUY IT!!!

" It wasn't so long ago that I had the privilege of meeting Linnea in Peru. She was just coming back from a fundraising journey to the States where she received a prize of recognition for her selfless work in Amazonia. I was with a tour group that was to stay at several Amazonian jungle lodges. The Amazon was in it's annual flood stage and the only way any of us could get around was by small boat. La doctora Linnea had her own dugout which she paddled to and from the clinic the lodge and her patients all by herself in a dress. She wore skirts almost entirely because of the humidity and local custom. The only women who wear shorts or pants in Amazonia are tourists and scientists. Every evening Linnea would come to the lodge for a bit of relaxation and conversation with whomever was staying there but one couldn't help but notice how more comfortable she was in the company of the locals and guides. The Ribiernos [local river dwellers] didn't ask rude or probing questions. They were friendly without conpromising her privacy.This ingrained need to keep part of herself to herself comes through in the book she's written. She's happy to talk about her work and her love of the people but reveals little of her previous life. I recommend this book for the incredible story the sense of place to learn about people we would otherwise never know. She may not speak book-learned Spanish but communicates fluently with her friends and patients. As she writes she arrived in Peru speaking no Spanish. ",4.0

It's hard to know how these descriptions will play out in the mind's eye of other readers.

She really likes what she is doing. The book confirms this.When you read this book you are looking inside La Doctora. Nothing is hidden. There are no pretenses. She is simply good people.Incidently she wanted the book named 'At the River's Edge' and the publishers wanted 'La Doctora'. The publishers won. ",4.0

The store owner agreed and took it out of his CD player and gave it to her half price since it was used.

I wasn't paying much attention to the lyrics or the songs it was just intended to be background music.I finished the whole cd i was still chatting and i wanted to listen it again. I didn't understand the lyrics but it sounded sad. I felt bad it made me think that De Sela came from poverty and an unhappy childhood i thought of South American kids running around in narrow streets.. I realized that i really loved these songs i don't know what the lyrics are about it just sounds that there is some pain and love in these songs.. In the 5th song 'El Payande' it sounds like she is defying somebody/something and then gives in. And then the next song starts playing it made me recall a summer in Barcelona..

Pleats seem to disguise that nicely. I recommend these because Dockers are great slacks and wear well and these are true Dockers.CA Luster ",4.0

" Welcome to the Splatterparty! This is one nasty little bloodbath showered down upon us with sick and grueling depravity that only underground horror can provide. Gorelovers grab a fork! Writer/director Leif Jonker and his friends actually financed much of this cult gem with their own blood using the money they earned from their donations at the nearby plasma bank.$5000 budget? Are you kidding me? I heard Rob Zombie's Halloween remake had a budget of around 15 million.Now it does have the expected problems that come with a super-low budget horror flick. Horrendous acting amateurish directing bad transfer. But really I think this adds to the charm. The narrative jumps around alot which didn't seem to serve much of a purpose. We're often given indications--23 minutes to daylight or 9 minutes to night. But it would still look like broad daylight. Kinda silly but all is forgiven. And when some people have a delayed reaction to the heinous onslaught occurring just in front of them you can't help but yell 'Run dummy!'. Oh well...Luckily there is enough awesome to make you forget about the ridiculous. Darkness is a pretty straight forward vampire story stuck back in the 80's. We've got mullets Hard Rock Cafe T-Shirts & some cheesy metal. The violence jumps right in and never stops. I'm talking about blood blood blood. And more blood. It sometimes feels more like a apocalyptic zombie tale. Other times maybe a gory cannibal flick. Trust me there will be lots of flesh rippage and gooey carnage.This has an incredibly vicious ending. Badass stuff! It kinda reminded me of the flesh melting scene at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark. But better! No CGI here though some phenomenal special effects regardless of the budget.Darkness",4.0
" I gave this flick 4 stars for the gore. It is plentiful and convincing enough especially given the budget(?). I had never heard of this flick so I don't know if it really has a cult following or not. Maybe in Germany but they'll watch ANYTHING. If you have a soft spot for low-budget splatter and are very forgiving you'll probably like this. It's kind of like a modern version of a Fred Olen Ray flick but with no boobs. The gore and action are spread liberally throughout so it never gets boring. There are a few(okay many) glaring examples of poor or lazy scripting(like the dumb broad who watches in horror as her boyfriend is torn apart for like 4 minutes instead of running yeah right) but nothing out of the ordinary for this type of movie. As a child of the 80's the cheesy thrash metal longhairs and mullet models that made up the cast(and probably the crew) really took me back and made me feel nostalgic. The plot such as it is is this",4.0

" This is required viewing since it is Martin and Lewis' first movie. As a comedy it's not that great. It's not very funny there's a lot of time wasted on generic dialog and Dean's character isn't likeable since he mostly shouts bullies womanizes and lies throughout. The movie is based on a play and it seems that some portions that may have played well in a live setting don't work on the screen. I can't be too sure since I don't know what is new to this movie and didn't appear in the play or what did work in 1950 but doesn't work in 2005.I got a good nostalgic feeling watching the movie. It gave me a feeling of sitting in a playhouse in 1940 with that era of audience and laughing at silly running gags like the half open door. Now that the bar has been raised so many times with comedy superstars like Eddie Murphy Richard Pryor Steve Martin Tom Hanks and Jerry Lewis himself it's fun to watch material from a simpler time.Dean comes across well. His singing is great he dances and does an excellent impersonation of Bing Crosby. This is a good showcase of his talent.Jerry also comes across well as expected with all of his trademarks. Bumbling clowning funny faces pouting mime. His singing was better than I expected.

The various subplots involving Jerry his wife and baby his former friendship with Dean Dean's two girlfriends and his military career Dean's romantic rival and the captain and his wife make for a somewhat complex plot.

" 'At War With The Army' Dean Martin & Jerry Lewis' first starring feature (after 2 plum supporting roles in 'My Friend Irma' and the sequel 'My Friend Irma Goes West') is clearly an excuse to see if this new comedy duo can carry a picture. And why not start them off in a service comedy? Look what 'Buck Privates' did for Abbott & Costello!AWWTA is based on a stage play and really looks it. With the exception of a few outdoor scenes most of the film is very 'stagebound' as the characters occupy a handful of set pieces and Martin & Lewis are obliged to share their screen time with a wide assortment of characters. Strangely enough Martin & Lewis do not seem to be intentionally paired as a team here since their characters only cavort in a few scenes together. One of the 'convincers' that they are a team is the 'Service Show' scene obviously a holdover from their nightclub act. The problem is that their 2 characters are mostly at odds with each other since one is Sargeant (Martin) while the other is a lowly Private (Lewis). Dean sings his songs as smoothly as he does in future movies while Jerry sings a cute funny novelty number that 'The Navy Gets the Gravy While the Army Gets the Beans' and does a curious turn in drag singing a French accent and mugging it up.The film has a sort of 'B-movie' feel to it mostly because it was produced by someone else and not Hal Wallis who would give such polish & style to their following films. The DVD interpretation here is scratchy dark & blurred in spots but still viewable.Although not their best by any means AWWTA was a big hit when it first debuted and was an indication that the best from Martin & Lewis was still to come.

" Hollywood Classics Collection DVD1950 Black & White with a running time of 92 min.Directed by Hal WalkerStarring Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin and introducing Polly BergenThe transfer from VHS to DVD was done well. The picture quality and sound are very good.In this film Martin and Lewis are starting out their career together. Martin plays a Sergeant that has girl troubles and Lewis plays a bumbling Private First Class. They find out that the Army isn't so accommondating to their wants or desires. Martin's singing in this film reminds us of how remarkable and charming he was. The antics Lewis performs shows us his talent of mockery and silliness. The best scenes of this film are when Lewis is dressed as a woman singing a love song to a drunk soldier and Lewis' battle with the soda machine. This film is a good family film but probably wouldn't keep the attention of the younger generations. However for our generation it is a nice look back at the beginning career of Martin and Lewis. ",4.0
" At War With the Army was the first starring role for the team of Martin and Lewis. They had yet to build that perfect chemistry together and most of their best scenes in the film are separate from each other. But still you could see where the duo would eventually go on to huge things in many future films.Martin plays bully Sgt. Puccinelli who is always picking (often nastily) on poor private Alvin Korwen (Lewis). They were buddies from back home but now Puccinelli just bosses Alvin around. There's not much plot to speak of. The action mainly takes base at an Army training base and more specifically in the orderly room. It's mostly an excuse for Jerry to do some of his trademark slapstick and for Dean to sing which is all ridiculously out of place but still fun to watch. Polly Bergen is along in her first role as Martin's girlfriend Helen.The Film was directed by Hal Walker who had worked on severl of the Hope & Crosby road pictures so he had some experience in dealing with a similiar comedy team although certainly one that was much more polished than Martin and Lewis were in 1950. Overall it was a light but entertaining comedy. Much like seeing the pair do their nightclub routine but framed by this army setting. ",4.0

" This book is one of those books that captured your attention from the beginning to the end. What differentiates this book from other books about Russia is the author's ability to convey to us the mood the essence of a country that was in the brink of collapse & to be revived as a brand new country. It is also one of those books that is difficult to be summarised in a few words but rather it has to be read to be appreciated. This work depicts Russia as a country with turbulent & troubled histories occupied by citizens some who were proud of its past glories (particularly its victory over the Facism in the war with Germany during World War 2 its Great Empire's status and a superforce to be reckoned with in the past) & would shed their bloods for the glory of their nation some who opted for the stability of the past when Communism seemed to promise that everybody is going to be looked after some who are anxious to be caught on with the rest of the world. For an ex-Communist country that tried to catch up with the West shamelessly influenced by capitalism for as long as we can remember it has to overcome its steep learning curve. Growing pains such as emergence of mafias instead of enterpreneurs surfaced corruptions civil wars & so forth. A few chapters in the book are highly interesting such as the rise & fall of Gorbachev (clearing the myths about him & conveying him as what a politician should be) the emergence of Yeltsin & despite their differences both of them deservedly win their places in history. Moreover there are also chapters about common people who are living in God forsaken places with no basic necessities such as clean air indoor plumbing heating system that actually works intellectuals who wanted to bring out the correct version of Russia's history so that they could learn from the past & evolve from there to better beings but alas it wasn't meant to be writers like Sakharov Solzhenitsyn who dared to write of the truths for the love of their nation with total disregard of their own safety people who were killed in the millions during Stalin's reign & Stalin as a person Khruschev Brezhnev coup-de-etat that was supposed to clean up the mess that Gorbachev had created but subsequently it was deemed as a farce in its own right & so forth. A substantial book that enlightens me about the plight of Russia & a book that is definitely worth reading in this lifetime. Highly recommended. ",4.0

" Having read this title while vacationing in Jamaica (even though placed in Dominica and the author grew up in Atigua)I was entirely able to understand Xuela. Many children are born out of wedlock though the fathers still are involved with their children. Xuela is an extreme but not implausible case of emotional detachment. Everything in the book from her father's corruption to encountering the stevedore during a downpour came to life in my reading experience. Be forewarned Xuela is not a likeable character and her physical self-love may be offensive to some readers. But Jamaica Kincaid's blunt and honest portrayal of a hardened woman is undeniably hard to forget. ",4.0

" The Autobiography of My Mother is not an autobiography at all and it is not even solely about a mother. It is actually a novel about a woman whose mother died when she was being born. This first life event which is also the first event the narrator tells the reader about in the story is a powerful force that shapes the narrator's life.Not only does narrator (Xuela) not have a mother but she feels that she does not actually have a country a homeland. She lives on the island of Antigua which is only twelve miles long and nine miles long. The culture of her people was stolen by their English colonizers and the only culture they now know is that of England.In my opinion there are times in the book when the narrator is self-pitying and repetitive. I do think however that this is in keeping with her character. The book is written as if Xuela is sitting down with the reader and telling him or her her life story and Xuela would definitely be a character who would repeat and overemphasize the bad parts just so the person listening would get the point.I also found fault with the narrator because she was very hyprocritical. She critized her father's actions and attitude about life but then she acted in simliar ways and had a simliar attitude. The one positive aspect about the main character is that she is a very strong woman who is not afraid to deviate from her society's acceptable ways of behaving.I was surprised that I liked this book so much when I did not like the narrator. I think it is because Kincaid had such an integrity when it came to writing about the main character. She presented all aspects positive and negative and didn't only show her in a good light. All aspiring authors can learn a lesson in characterization from reading this book.Kincaid's writing style is very seductive. It pulls you in and makes you not want to get away. I read this book in two long settings because I didn't want to put it down. She has a powerful way of describing people places and situations. Her prose is lyrical and truthful - after reading a passage I wanted to sit back and think about it for awhile because there was so much truth and beauty to be found in it.This is the first book I have read by Jamaica Kincaid. I am presently reading 'A Small Place' and hope to read the rest of her books in the future. I would recommend this book to anyone but especially to writers who are interested in reading very high quality writing with strong charactarization and powerful description. ",4.0
" It is difficult to rate Autobiography of My Mother fairly; Jamaica Kincaid has written excellent books - At the Bottom of the River Lucy . . . - and this book is only well above average. Were my expectations not so high the things that are right about the book would stand out more against the portions that don't work. She is at her best when portraying the inability to love and the bitterness at the colonialist religion. However there are points in the story where the political portrayal of victor vs. vanquished becomes a polemic out of character of the protagonist. A good book that is well worth reading - but is probably more enjoyable if you have read Annie John Lucy or One Small Place so that the political polemic fits the reader's growing knowledge of the author rather than simply being an element less adroitly handled in this particular book.

" As a child did you ever hear your mother call 'Time to come inside and practice?' You were having a great time playing outdoors doing really fun things with your friends and now you have sit inside on a piano bench and play those durn scales.Or as a parent have you been frustrated because your offspring won't take time to practice when you're paying good money for flute violin or tuba lessons?Most of us have been in one of those situations or both. Now Amy Nathan author of 'The Young Musician's survival Guide' gives us her latest book which proves we're not alone. 'Meet the Musicians' is an upbeat informative up-close-and-personal look at 15 professional musicians all members of the New York Philharmonic. Many of them didn't like to practice when they were kids any more than we did. As adults and accomplished disciplined musicians they offer excellent practice tips for both parents and children as well as sharing the paths they took to being part of a world class symphony orchestra.Beginning with Carter Brey Cello and concluding with John Deak Bass we find photos of these musicians as children their favorite childhood activities their educational backgrounds the inside scoop on particular instruments how they came to be members of the New York Philharmonic and brief biographical sketches.Young readers will easily relate to these musicians on many different levels.Violist Cynthia Phelps said 'When I'm on stage I think I'm the luckiest person in the world having such a good time doing what I love to do.' She speaks for the musicians represented here and perhaps for the musicians of tomorrow.Also included in 'Meet the Musicians' is a helpful glossary and list of resources for those who wish to further pursue an interest in music.- Gail Cooke ",4.0

" My cd arrived securely packaged in a corrugated cardboard envelope. The cd itself was in a plain paper sleeve not the nice cover shown in the picture. However I have seen karaoke cds from this particular company before in karaoke supply stores and all Superstar Karaoke cds came in plain paper sleeves--no cover no plastic box no lyric booklet pretty basic as karaoke cds go. However the quality of sound and selection of songs is really good considering how inexpensive and no-frills this company is. There are no vocal demonstrations on this cd but the instrumental tracks contain the appropriate background vocals. Of course when played on home or professional karaoke systems you will have the standard graphics with the color changing lyrics. For those who would like vocal demos or a printed lyric booklet you might try a different company.I am actually very pleased with this product since I knew pretty much what I would be getting and I loved the songs.Also a couple of notes for those completely new to karaoke cds--these recordings DO NOT contain the actual original artists but the original keys and arrangements are the same in the recreations.

" I first started taking this because I saw it on Dr. OZ as a remedy for menstrual cramps well what I saw on Dr. OZ was actually 'Chaste Tree Extract' but I have not been able to find that. This is probably the same thing because it works. I started taking it a few days before I expected my period and continued until my period was over and my cramps were not as agonizing as they usually are. I soon started to notice that my hormonal acne (Nodulocystic acne on my chin) was not as bad when taking these supplements so I started taking it every day. That led to the unexpected 'problem' of me not getting my period for several months. I got a little scared and went to the doctor about it. She told me to stop taking it and sure enough I got my period a few months later. I didn't take this stuff for a while because of the whole messing with my cycle thing I figured it would be best not to do that but recently my hormonal acne has been raging again no amount of acne cream was making it go away so I started taking this again and it went away within a few days. I figure maybe I can treat this stuff like the birth control pill (not for birth control obviously) but to even out my hormones and I can stop taking it for a week or so to make sure I don't go months without a period. At the time I was also taking St. Johns Wart which I am no longer taking so that could have been the cause of my missed periods since it seems that everyone else reports more regular periods on this herb.

" I read the book in it's entirety the day I received it. At $24 I thought I'd be getting a comprehensive & possible critical review of each short story or novel RAH ever wrote. Don't get me wrong I really enjoyed the book. It's a fun read and there is a lot of information there. Just no critical review or analysis of the stories. I started reading RAH back around 1960 (early teen years) and immediately fell in love with them. He introduced me to Science Fiction and I went on to read and enjoy many other great writers. I've lost count as to how many times I have read each of his works. There is no question that RAH is the Bard of the genre. I had hoped that in this book there would have been information and a point of view that I hadn't already read or known about for all these years.However if you are a new reader or just have read a few of his works this book can help you find some of his 'stronger' works to read. But I strongly recommend that you find (it's out of print and somewhat difficult to find) an early work entitled 'The Past Through Tomorrow' which contains most of his 'Future History' stories. This one I've read many times and never get tired of reading it. From very short to novel length each story is a gem. They remind me of a Beatle album in that every track is a 5 star gem. Have fun.

" This album isn't for everyone but it's still a great album.If you're a fan of dirty punk music e.g. the Dead Boys Fear the Ramones the Dead Kennedys or the Sex Pistols you're probably a good candidate for appreciating this album. The vocals are unorthodox to say the least. Most of the lyrics are in Japanese or English and all of them are either spit or screamed.Every chord piano gliss drum beat and jubilant yell is absolutely bursting with lightning-energy. The 5 6 7 8s remind me of a female Japanese version of the Kingsmen (Louie Louie). They play dirty loud fun garage rock with the occassional rip roaring surf tune.If you have ecletic tastes this is a good band to pick up. If you like sugary pop or strictly mainstream music then you'll probably think this band is full of no-talent hacks. You'd be wrong of course but you'd still have felt like you wasted money.If you're crazy enough to embrace this kind of music but don't think it goes quite far enough give Guitar Wolf a try. They hold the record for the loudest band in the world and they're a crazy Japanese punk band. ",4.0
" Do the Mojo! Meaning buy this 5678's CD and rock out to it. 'Teenage Mojo Workout' is divided almost equally between cover songs and originals. It's nostalgic enough for many a retro rock fiend yet cool enough for the youthly crowd.Musicians just don't tell us to 'do the go-go' or sing songs titled 'Hanky Panky' any more and that's where this hard-rockin' girl-trio from Japan comes in. Word has it that the band's name originates from the notion that the fifties was Elvis the sixties was surf the seventies was punk and the eighties was the 5678's. 'Mojo' has the potential to soothe the savage rockabilly junkie and even the odd honky-tonk fan with it's wailing pop of yore guitar licks groovy hip-shaking basslines and jump-uppity drumming.Cover tracks on the CD include 'I'm Blue' originally by Ike and Tina Turner's The Ikettes and 'Harlem Shuffle' by Bob and Earl (also covered by the Rolling Stones).The vocals are largely in Engrish so listeners lacking patience and a sense of humor may feel flummoxed and frustrated with much of the singing. For example the 'Harlem Shuffle' lyric 'you slide into the limbo/Yeah how low can you go' sounds more like 'soar into the rainbow/Woo harm an eagle'.Only Japanese speakers will have the slightest clue what vocalist/guitarist Ronnie Yoshiko Fujiyama is singing about on 'New Orleans Rock' but the jazzy piano can be a welcome addition to the album's line-up especially as part of the final track. No foreign language or Engrish-comprehension skills are required to understand the the instrumentals 'Road Runner' 'Typhoon Girl' and 'Green Onions'. Knock yourself out.If the album is a 'Workout' then 'In the Subway' is the cooldown. The title track features a wild tambourine while 'In the Subway' has soft-rippling timpanies. Ronnie's voice sounds sultry and soothing on 'Subway' whereas she usually sings with a scratchy shout.The liner notes are mostly in Japanese but the b&w; studio photo of Ronnie on the back cover defies language.This CD is not recommended for everyone but if you came to look for it here then you probably want it and you should probably get it.

" A very well written and insightful book. Bazyn uses an impressive number of examples from the Bible other sacred texts and literature to make his points. Because of this the book might seem overwhelming to someone who is not well-read. On the other hand Bazyn's writing is accessible and easy to understand. The book offers good and practical advice for living a better life. My only disappointments were one or two isolated comments by Bazyn which I feel downplay the evil of abortion. ",4.0
" 'The Rock' (another professional wrestler) would be better suited as the lead man in this film as he displays far more cinematic charisma than Cena.This is not a woman's touchy feely movie- it's a violent showdown of good vs evil with the good guy displaying almost superhuman abilities.

" John Cena plays John Triton a Marine who was discharged after disobeying a direct order in order to save his fellow soldiers in war. He returns home to his wife Kate (Kelly Carlson) and after not being able to adjust to his homelife so easliy they take a vacation. Unfortunally John ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time as he crosses paths with a group of jewel thieves at a gas station led by a killer named Rome (Robert Patrick) and after things don't go as planned they go on the run & kidnap Kate as a hostage. From there John goes after the thieves to save his wife but encounter many obsticals along with the way while the theives have problems of their own such as not being to trust each other & Kate being tougher than she looks.This is one of those generic action movies where the plot itself was very simple & something the average person can understand. The acting isn't much as Cena had no previous acting experience before this role so his dialog is very limited but did do well & was believeable in his role. They have good action scenes from a car chase to fist fights to tons of explosions. The most annoying thing here though was that they tried to add comedy to this movie which didn't work at all. For example when the bad guys are in the jungle running from the police...that's not the time to start making jokes about 'rock candy' & getting calls about their cable TV package eventhough I did get a chuckle as the priceless look Patrick gave after the 'he's like the Terminator' line.While the DVD included both the unrated & theatrical versions of the movie the DVD extras include all the WWE promotional features footage of the World Premiere various features on John Cena and a 'Making Of' featurette. Bottom line is that this movie is good for those who just like a good old action flick that you used to see back in the 80's full of explosions & fist fight scenes. ",4.0
" It's back to the good old days.The action packed Schwarzennegger films where the kill-shot reigns with side-splitting dialogue.Problem is! Robert Patrick is the star. John Cena makes a credible Arnold but Mr. Patrick does a wonderful villain. He's got the lines and he's nailed the perfect bad guy with a flair that would make Hannibal Lecter cringe. A great job by the former star of The X-Files who made John Doggett a memorable experience.Action and blowup sequences are A-1 all the way.The perfect film for escapist violence. ",4.0

" OK. First off I don't see this movie winning any prizes for story script plot or anything like that.That being said I think it was a good action flick. It was well-casted the fight scenes were well-choreographed and the explosions were lots of fun. Also I think it was a good start for Cena. Get the man some acting lessons and let him try something that doesn't involve as much running around and beating the heck out of people. ",4.0
" You pays your money and you takes your choice. When you go to see a movie like this you should know what you're in for. There's going to be a lot of bad guys and they're going to be really bad. There's going to be a damsel in distress. There's going to be a surprise bad guy. And last but not least there's going to be a good guy who is good and tough beyond belief.John Triton (John Cena) is an heroic ex-marine whose wife Kate (Kelly Carlson) is kidnapped by a brutal gang of jewel thieves led by Rome (Robert Patrick) who kills with glee and without remorse which doesn't set him apart from his psychopathic gang members. John takes out after them. You get the feeling that John can take on anything up to the size of a platoon without much of a problem. While credibility might suffer during his chase it's still fun. You will rarely see a human being with arms the size of Cena's.Written (Michelle Gallagher and Alan McElroy) and directed (John Bonito) with humor and pace what surprised me about it was that the acting is uniformly good including Cena. This is a tongue-in-cheek chase film with some absurdly unbelievable stunts and special effects but it's all done on a level that nobody takes very seriously.Although there is a lot of violence it's not graphic in the sense that we see people's heads being blown off. I was tired and sleepy when I attended the film but never even felt a twinge of nodding off.Perfect for a saturday night with friends after a long week of work. ",4.0
" I am surprised by how much I enjoyed this. Surprised and a little disappointed in my own taste but anyway...You know exactly what to expect from this movie. Explosions Fighting...and that's it. Luckily it delivers both of those in spades especially the 'splosions. I have never seen so many things blow up. Every fifteen minutes John Cena barely escapes some building blowing up. And in slow motion of course. The story is Kelly Carlson is kidnapped by Robert Patrick and John Cena must rescue her.Robert Patrick is plain fantastic in this flick. The filmmaker is smart as he gave the lion's share of the line to Mr. Patrick. He plays a great sarcastic bad guy plain and simple. John Cena can act in the sense that Arnold Schwarzenegger can act. Mr. Cena lets his actions do the speaking thankfully. Plus he's a hottie so...Overall just an easy cheesy blow-em-up action B-movie. The extras are pretty lame though. ",4.0

I personally think he was great in this movie - he looked hunky and shows he can act as well as kick butt. I hope that he will do more movies in the future - and also look forward to seeing him on Monday night RAW - the champ is in the house and if you are not down with that I have 2 words for ya . ..

" I rented 'The Marine' with no expectations except for good action and 'eye candy' (Mr. Cena is a beautiful man). I always enjoy the classic good vs. evil story and seeing the bad guy get it. Think of the 80's action movies and that is what 'The Marine' is like. I enjoyed the movie and while I am not a wrestling fan I do support the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) because they support our troops all over the world. They make trips to bases every year and risk their safety to entertain the wonderful men and women of our Armed Forces! John Cena has a very likable quality and because of his love and appreciation for our troops and their families he can rest assured that I will gladly give my dollars and support to him in whatever he undertakes.

" THE MARINEI have to admit that I have enjoyed all of the 7 or 8 or something like that WWE produced films this one in particular. Sure some have been better then others but all have at least been entertaining this one here would be in that category. I always liked John Cena especially when he was a heel he has always been entertaining. So once WWE really wanted to get going with the movies I knew Cena would be starring in one. I am glad that the film did well enough at the box office for them to let him do another. I found this movie to be very enjoyable even though it is flawed.The movie is about John Triton an ex marine who is having a hard time adjusting to his new life as a civilian. After a mishap at a security guard job he took he and his wife decided to go on a trip to any were just to get away on vacation. It is on this trip that they run into some trouble at a gas station it turns out that some people who are also there just robbed a diamond place and is on the run. When things go wrong Triton's wife is kidnapped by these guys and the chase is on. So the rest of the movie we are treated to an action filled adventure that pits one man's love for his wife against those who have a lust for money and power.The strong point of this film is obviously the ridiculous unbelievable action sequences and I do mean unbelievable. Michell Gallagher and Alan McElroy did a decent job with the script basically just adding a few words to pages full of explosions and fist fights. For this a WWE film that is just fine and I did not expect any thing else so it makes perfect sense. Director John Bonito shows that he has a talent for making a fun yet over the top action flick and he even makes Cena look good in his first acting gig so credit to you sir. Director of photography David Eggby did a great job shooting this movie as the camera work is great Executive producer Vince McMahon knows how to hire the right people. Every one behind the scenes did what a consider a good job given that this was supposed to be a WWE action movie job well done.As far as the acting I think that while Cena has a way to go before he wins any Oscars he actually does a good job with this film he has a natural charisma that carries over onto the screen. At times it looks like the performance is forced but over all he does a pretty good job in my opinion I don't know why but I think he would be perfect in a comedy or a family comedy. Kelly Carlson is good as Cena's wife and brings a nice little charm to the film even though at times she gets rough with the other characters. Robert Patrick is great in the lead villain role with a sly humor to him and his partner Abigail Bianca is just as good. In fact to be honest no one does a bad job in this film and in fact all of them do very well for this type of film.I liked this movie I thought it was a fun over the top action flick in the vain of 80's movies [like other reviews have said]; it is a good weekend/afternoon movie. A lot of people talk bad about this movie and John Cena in particular but I liked it and Cena. I think if Cena is given time to develop as an actor I think he could actually be good. Hopefully he has developed more for the upcoming '12 Rounds'; I will go see it keep up the WWE streak. Hope to see ya there. ",4.0

It will entertain and it isn't a waste of money or time .3 1/2 Stars ",4.0
" The Marine is a no holds barred action vehicle filled with cardboard characters and a plot straight out of an episode of the 1980's G.I. Joe cartoon. Yeah there are plot holes logic bombs and more cheesy dialogue than Kraft could put in a dozen commercials but this doesn't stop the movie from being a lot of fun to watch.WWE wrestling superstar John Cena plays John Triton a U.S. Marine who has been scapegoated and dishonorably discharged for disobeying an order from commanding officers and is making an adjustment to civilian life with his hot wife. He gets a job at a security firm where...he gets fired for disobeying an order. After this mishap he and his wife decide to go away where at a gas station they run afoul of some diamond smugglers who kill a cop and kidnap take his wife for a hostage so they can make their getaway. In the quest to get her back Triton goes through car chases explosions and death defying scenarios. It's best not to take these too seriously; this is the kind of action movie where you turn your brain off and enjoy the show.Despite the logic holes The Marine reminds me of the kind of old-fashioned action movie I used to watch back in the late 1980's-1990's like American Ninja or Ninja III",4.0
" Yes the plot is paper-thin and fairly ridiculous but for a fun mindless action romp this film delivers. John Cena is quite good and natural as an actor and Robert Patrick is always great. There was some very funny dialogue as the film did seem to be spoofing the entire genre. And it is always funny to watch the hero emerge from non-stop brutal fights and blazing infernos with scarcely a hair out of place. ",4.0
