have no,-1.0
trying to,-1.0
was very,-1.0
none of,-1.0
more like,-1.0
one song,-1.0
just not,-1.0
try to,-1.0
if this,-1.0
i guess,-1.0
wanted to,-1.0
at all,-1.0
am a,-1.0
what is,-1.0
it sounds,-1.0
because they,-1.0
if i,-1.0
make a,-1.0
to like,-1.0
lack of,-1.0
buy the,-1.0
sound like,-1.0
you want,-1.0
is just,-1.0
all i,-1.0
should have,-1.0
i listened,-1.0
the only,-1.0
can not,-1.0
good song,-1.0
to do,-1.0
not have,-1.0
some good,-1.0
to play,-1.0
the rest,-1.0
does not,-1.0
buy this,-1.0
i mean,-1.0
to sound,-1.0
like they,-1.0
good songs,-1.0
only one,-1.0
any of,-1.0
but this,-1.0
much better,-1.0
what a,-1.0
than a,-1.0
i gave,-1.0
i will,-1.0
they had,-1.0
is not,-1.0
rest of,-1.0
i could,-1.0
instead of,-1.0
was not,-1.0
going to,-1.0
other than,-1.0
or two,-1.0
i thought,-1.0
i want,-1.0
are just,-1.0
used to,-1.0
is all,-1.0
know that,-1.0
a decent,-1.0
it just,-1.0
the same,-1.0
she has,-1.0
think i,-1.0
about it,-1.0
am not,-1.0
they could,-1.0
to them,-1.0
a big,-1.0
bought this,-1.0
has to,-1.0
to give,-1.0
not the,-1.0
what the,-1.0
the point,-1.0
the fact,-1.0
is to,-1.0
it would,-1.0

because the,-1.0
are not,-1.0
was just,-1.0
fact that,-1.0

type of,-1.0
quality of,-1.0
just a,-1.0
because i,-1.0
too much,-1.0
want to,-1.0
make the,-1.0
think that,-1.0
i am,-1.0
i expected,-1.0
like i,-1.0
and that,-1.0
or even,-1.0
say this,-1.0
the original,-1.0
a real,-1.0
on it,-1.0
looking for,-1.0
might be,-1.0
piece of,-1.0
pretty much,-1.0
we have,-1.0
at least,-1.0
i found,-1.0
so i,-1.0
if they,-1.0

me wrong,-1.0
as if,-1.0
is no,-1.0
people who,-1.0
being a,-1.0
these guys,-1.0

they were,-1.0
this recording,-1.0
who are,-1.0
of it,-1.0
with this,-1.0
he does,-1.0
i did,-1.0
it was,-1.0
for the,-1.0
for that,-1.0
that song,-1.0
of what,-1.0
to take,-1.0
heard the,-1.0
band that,-1.0
that was,-1.0
but not,-1.0
have been,-1.0
most of,-1.0
as they,-1.0
of this,-1.0
it to,-1.0
her voice,-1.0
seem to,-1.0
more than,-1.0
even the,-1.0
you are,-1.0
due to,-1.0
up and,-1.0
bought the,-1.0
up to,-1.0
voice is,-1.0
from this,-1.0
rather than,-1.0
is what,-1.0
make it,-1.0
to hear,-1.0
to my,-1.0
what he,-1.0
of these,-1.0
in this,-1.0
could be,-1.0
the record,-1.0
on a,-1.0
i really,-1.0
is really,-1.0
had to,-1.0
but that,-1.0
the songs,-1.0
first two,-1.0
that would,-1.0
is that,-1.0
of you,0.0
from a,1.0
because of,1.0
on this,1.0
get a,1.0
that has,1.0
let me,1.0
as i,1.0
had the,1.0
like that,1.0
that this,1.0
really like,1.0
that were,1.0
the good,1.0
not really,1.0
look at,1.0
on my,1.0
to his,1.0
there was,1.0
over and,1.0
i can,1.0
put out,1.0
that i,1.0
and for,1.0
what you,1.0
is about,1.0
listen to,1.0
will not,1.0
he was,1.0
and was,1.0
in it,1.0
enough to,1.0
songs on,1.0
like the,1.0
a band,1.0
when he,1.0
the production,1.0
that the,1.0
so much,1.0
was a,1.0
i heard,1.0
think the,1.0
but they,1.0
what i,1.0
you have,1.0
after listening,1.0
but you,1.0
that he,1.0
of all,1.0
the radio,1.0
a whole,1.0
close to,1.0
on here,1.0
there are,1.0
the new,1.0
to this,1.0
since i,1.0
there is,1.0
when you,1.0
may be,1.0
half of,1.0
of a,1.0
many of,1.0
part of,1.0
on his,1.0
will be,1.0
it on,1.0
then i,1.0
sound quality,1.0
i have,1.0
the lyrics,1.0
couple of,1.0
are the,1.0
more of,1.0
kind of,1.0
of those,1.0
the sound,1.0
are a,1.0
not to,1.0
if you,1.0
a good,1.0
what they,1.0
songs are,1.0
that is,1.0
like to,1.0
check out,1.0
music is,1.0
the other,1.0
a couple,1.0
for a,1.0
it up,1.0
be the,1.0
all of,1.0
it in,1.0
this album,1.0
better than,1.0
about this,1.0
i like,1.0
the tracks,1.0
with their,1.0
tracks on,1.0
and if,1.0
and has,1.0
are good,1.0
of them,1.0
for you,1.0
to get,1.0
and there,1.0
these songs,1.0
and i,1.0
this was,1.0
decided to,1.0
in his,1.0
had been,1.0
have ever,1.0
and their,1.0
to come,1.0
and then,1.0
much of,1.0
about the,1.0
i feel,1.0
ever heard,1.0
of that,1.0
off the,1.0
than the,1.0
is good,1.0
after the,1.0
but in,1.0
on the,1.0
which i,1.0
over the,1.0
to find,1.0
to the,1.0
time to,1.0
but it,1.0
good as,1.0
the next,1.0
all the,1.0
lyrics are,1.0
this record,1.0
of her,1.0
as an,1.0
the song,1.0
pretty good,1.0
into a,1.0
think this,1.0
the whole,1.0
even though,1.0
and even,1.0
songs that,1.0
for some,1.0
album from,1.0
but a,1.0
been a,1.0
the entire,1.0
as much,1.0
a lot,1.0
in their,1.0
was the,1.0
i never,1.0
the time,1.0
lot of,1.0
i think,1.0
which is,1.0
song on,1.0
a few,1.0
have a,1.0
get the,1.0
the vocals,1.0
for me,1.0
as good,1.0
of their,1.0
songs from,1.0
it out,1.0
track on,1.0
much more,1.0
other songs,1.0
compared to,1.0
it is,1.0
this one,1.0
the guitar,1.0
one is,1.0
his music,1.0
version of,1.0
with all,1.0
the second,1.0
as a,1.0
his voice,1.0
to have,1.0
come to,1.0
album is,1.0
sound is,1.0
at a,1.0
this music,1.0
music that,1.0
of the,1.0
out the,1.0
no one,1.0
i had,1.0
able to,1.0
with the,1.0
it a,1.0
an album,1.0
when i,1.0
this collection,1.0
the music,1.0
heard it,1.0
is better,1.0
through the,1.0
good and,1.0
by the,1.0
to a,1.0
seems to,1.0
song that,1.0
that makes,1.0
in a,1.0
and have,1.0
are very,1.0
in the,1.0
the old,1.0
the past,1.0
fan of,1.0
all that,1.0
the studio,1.0
and he,1.0
sort of,1.0
such a,1.0
first album,1.0
and all,1.0
had a,1.0
think it,1.0
not only,1.0
stand out,1.0
a new,1.0
a different,1.0
was in,1.0
a listen,1.0
after a,1.0
with some,1.0
i find,1.0
to her,1.0
music and,1.0

album and,1.0
it did,1.0
to see,1.0
vocals are,1.0
with that,1.0
band is,1.0
even if,1.0
any other,1.0
they did,1.0
his own,1.0
